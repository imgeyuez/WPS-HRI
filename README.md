# WPS-HRI

This repository's content are various tools to analyse and identify depictions of the roles of Heroes, Victims and Villains within the WPS corpus.

There is no main script, with which the different tools could be used. It is rather a collection of methods which represent our approach to the task. Unfortunatly, some absolute paths are still included in some scripts. But it will be genralised over time. 

The finalized fine-tuned RoBERTa model is too big to be uploaded on GitHub. If you are interested in it, feel free to contact us. 

Soon we'll upload an inference script with which a user can just pass a tokenised text as input and will get an output with role-predictions.
