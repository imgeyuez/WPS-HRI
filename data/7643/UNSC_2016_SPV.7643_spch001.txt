The President: The Security Council will now
begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

Members of the Council have before them document
S/2016/235, which contains the text of a draft resolution
submitted by the United States of America.

Members of the Council also have before them
document S/2016/239, which contains a proposed
amendment submitted by Egypt to the draft resolution
contained in document S/2016/235.

The Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the
draft resolution contained in document 8/2016/235 and
on the proposed amendment contained in document
S/2016/239.

Members of the Council have before them the
proposed amendment submitted by Egypt contained
in document S/2016/239. Rule 36 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure stipulates, inter alia,
the following:

"when an amendment adds to or deletes from the
text of a motion or draft resolution, that amendment
shall be voted on first."

Accordingly, I intend to put the proposed amendment
to the vote now.

I shall first call on those members of the Council
who wish to make statements before the voting on the
proposed amendment.
