Mr. Vitrenko (Ukraine): Ukraine welcomes the
adoption of resolution 2272 (2016), which we consider
to be a milestone document. We commend the United
States delegation for its leadership in that regard.

During yesterday's debate (see S/PV.7642),
the lack of sufficient progress in the fight against
sexual exploitation and abuse in the past decade was
acknowledged by almost all delegations. Unfortunately,
the number ofallegations has not diminished. The crimes
committed today are as appalling as they were years
ago. We believe that the Security Council is uniquely
positioned to send a strong message to confront this
problem. That is why we fully supported the adoption
of today's resolution. We hope that the document we
have adopted will serve as a clear signal to all parties
concerned that the Security Council stands for the
pressing need to implement a more assertive approach
in order to address the scourge of sexual exploitation
and abuse promptly.

As an active troop- and police-contributing country,
Ukraine reaffirms its determination to effectively
contribute to the fight against sexual exploitation and
abuse, to engage with all stakeholders and to implement
the necessary steps and mechanisms, including those
envisaged in today's resolution.
