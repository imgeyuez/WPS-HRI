Mr. Oyarzun Marchesi (Spain) (spoke in Spanish):
Spain thanks the United States for this important
initiative.

We have just adopted resolution 2272 (2016), the
first to address exclusively conduct deemed completely
unacceptable. With this resolution, the Security
Council is sending a strong message to all who have
the responsibility to eliminate this scourge, and that
responsibility is collective. My delegation supported the
text put forward in its entirety and without amendment,
because quite simply we cannot address the issue of
accountability in a partial manner. The reason for that
is obvious. Our aim is not to repatriate contingents,
but to protect the victims and prevent the repetition of
aggressive acts. It is therefore necessary to investigate
such matters as soon as possible or inform the Secretary-
General of the measures taken. The perpetrators must
be brought to justice and serve their sentences. All of
that is first and foremost the responsibility of the troop-
and police contributing countries, precisely because we
do not want the work of a contingent to be tarnished by
the actions of some of its members. Let us ensure that
we all assume our responsibility.
