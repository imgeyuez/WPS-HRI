Mr. Yoshikawa (Japan): Japan voted in favour of
resolution 2272 (2016), proposed by the United States.
Since we spoke on our views on sexual exploitation and

abuse in the Chamber yesterday (see S/PV.7642), I wish
to emphasize only one point, which is why we think
that this resolution is important and necessary.

Japan supports the Secretary-General's decision
to repatriate contingents when there is a demonstrated
pattern of misconduct. That measure is aimed not at
pointing a finger at contingents, but at protecting
civilians where peacekeepers are deployed. Its purpose
is also to urge troop- and police-contributing countries
to take action. We need to realize that investigating
allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse is the
primary responsibility oftroop- and police-contributing
countries, and they have to take appropriate actions
against the allegations and hold personnel accountable
for sexual exploitation and abuse.

In doing so, the United Nations will ensure that
its peacekeepers, who are sometimes the last hope for
people suffering in conflicts, are deployed to protect
people. By taking the appropriate actions, they can also
preserve the honour of the vast majority of peacekeepers
from Africa, the Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the
Caribbean, and Europe, including my own country,
Japan, which are fulfilling their tasks seriously in
difficult circumstances. It is our belief that resolution
2272 (2016) will send a clear message that the Security
Council fully supports the zero-tolerance policy called
for by the Secretary-General.
