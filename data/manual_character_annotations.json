      "Text": "Mr. Hannesson (Iceland): Security Council  resolution 1325 (2000) lays down the ground rules for  women to play a central role in conflict prevention,  peacekeeping and peace-building. The key issue now is  implementation. Like those who preceded us, we  welcome the decision by the presidency to hold this  open debate to mark the resolution's third anniversary.  Such debates remain necessary, considering how far we  are from full implementation.    By adopting the resolution, the Security Council  acknowledged that women have a role to play, whether  it concerns conflict prevention, peace negotiations,  peacekeeping or reconstruction.    The United Nations involvement in such  processes and its promotion of gender equality is a key  element to establish peace and security in conflict  regions. The Security Council should put the same  effort into ensuring the implementation of resolution  1325 (2000) as it puts into all its other resolutions. The  effectiveness of the United Nations and its  international authority ultimately rest on the extent to  which it is seen to implement its own decisions.    Iceland has consistently supported gender  equality and the advancement of women. Resolution  1325 (2000) is an important element of the United  Nations agenda in that field.    The Icelandic Government has, for the past three  years, been financing the post of a gender expert at the  United Nations Development Fund for Women  (UNIFEM) office in Kosovo, where UNIFEM. has been  playing an important role in advancing gender equality.  The Icelandic Government stresses the importance of  hiring both men and women for the Icelandic  peacekeeping unit.    We welcome the appointment of an interim  Gender Adviser to the Department of Peacekeeping  Operations. We hope that the permanent position of  Senior Gender Adviser will be filled shortly. Staff  working directly on gender issues must be included in  all peacekeeping operations and afforded effective  authority to ensure compliance at all levels. We also  encourage the Secretary-General, as a matter of  priority, to appoint more women as special  representatives and envoys, as called for in resolution  1325 (2000).    Iceland was the tenth State to ratify the Rome  Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The  entry-into-force of the Statute and the establishment of  the Court represent a major breakthrough for the  protection of human rights, including those of women.  It recognizes, inter alia, the specific impact of armed  conflict on women by criminalizing sexual and gender  violence and puts an end to impunity through ensuring  effective investigation and prosecution of those crimes  by the Court. It also addresses another very important  subject that is reflected in resolution 1325 (2000): by  being the most gender-balanced bench of all  international judicial institutions, the ICC provides an  excellent example of how to ensure the increased  representation of women at all decision-making levels."

      "Text": "Mr. Nebenzia (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I would like to thank the German presidency  for organizing today's meeting and to express our  profound gratitude to the participants and briefers for  their information about various aspects of the fight  against sexual violence and armed conflict.  This year marks a decade since the Security  Council established the post of Special Representative  of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in  Conflict. Since then the Special Representative and her  Office have done extensive work on eliminating this  form of crime. They have gained useful experience in  cooperating with Governments and other parties to  armed conflicts and developing an effective toolkit for  combating this type of crime.    The Russian Federation is committed to international  cooperation in combating sexual violence in conflict,  which is a disgusting crime of war. We firmly support  the work of Special Representative Patten and appreciate  her personal contribution to efforts to develop and  support dialogue with parties to armed conflicts in  addressing this issue, help victims and assist in their  rehabilitation, as well as to draw public attention to  the problems caused by such crimes. We thank the  Secretary-General for his briefing and his report on  conflict-related sexual violence (S/2019/280), which  is enabling us to discuss the issue in a productive and  comprehensive debate. We have studied with interest  the report's very extensive recommendations on ways  to cooperate further in combating sexual violence in  conflict. Many of the proposals deserve careful and  detailed study, and we believe that today's debate is a  good opportunity for an open exchange of views on that.    We firmly believe that the key to success in  combating sexual violence in conflict is in developing  effective measures to eradicate violence against  civilians during armed conflicts. But that is just one of  the possible crimes that could be committed during an  armed conflict. In our view, putting a definitive end to  every form of violence against civilians is possible only  by resolving armed conflicts through peaceful means  and eradicating their root causes. We need concerted  work at both the national and international levels if we  are to reach that goal as quickly as possible.    In that regard, we want to emphasize once  again how important it is to ensure that the Special  Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual  Violence in Conflict continues to adhere to the mandate  established by resolution 1888 (2009). The central focus  of her efforts should be situations of armed conflict,  and specifically those where sexual Violence is  widespread. Every conflict situation has specifics that  must be taken into account. It is also important not to  underestimate the significance of maintaining a united  approach to understanding the scope of the Security  Council's mandate on combating sexual violence in  conflict and of refraining from attempts to broaden its  interpretation and take the Council beyond its remit of  maintaining international peace and security. A strict  distinction should be made between sexual violence as  a war crime and as an ordinary criminal offence.    We should remember that the effectiveness of the  Council's work in eliminating sexual violence in conflict  is directly dependent on overcoming differences,  promoting constructive cooperation and preventing the  issue from being politicized. We call on everyone to  unite their efforts to combat this repugnant crime in the  interests of maintaining peace and assisting victims,  and for the sake ofbuilding ajust society where there is  no place for any kind of violence at all."

      "Text": "Ms. Skare: Thank you, Mr. President, for letting  NATO participate in this important debate. I would  also like to thank the briefers for their excellent  presentations.    Civil society organizations have been instrumental  in promoting women's rights and gender equality.  To a large degree, it was thanks to civil society that  resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security  saw the light of day 12 years ago. As much as States  and intergovernmental organizations show leadership  in advancing that agenda, we have to recognize the  important role that members of civil society play as  opinion leaders and sources of information, as well as  in keeping us accountable.    While States have the primary responsibility  for ensuring the implementation of the resolutions  on women and peace and security, NATO, as a  political-military organization, is playing its part within  NATO-led operations and within our partnerships. We  have a policy, we have an action plan and, together with  partners, we are turning words into deeds.    On the political level, NATO is actively encouraging  all its partners to adopt specific goals related to the  promotion of women, peace and security issues in the  various partnership programmes they develop with  our organization. The overall aim is to raise awareness  and to work towards greater female participation in  the areas of defence and security. Women are still  underrepresented in peace and reconciliation processes,  and we encourage States and our partners to ensure  women's participation in the prevention, management  and resolution of conflicts.    At the operational level, NATO and its operational  partners in the International Security Assistance  Force (ISAF) and Kosovo Force have demonstrated a  strong commitment to promoting the important role  that women can play, and have engaged with women  leaders and activists to understand their views and  perspectives. The Alliance has gender advisers and  focal points at its various headquarters, as well as in  operational theatres in Afghanistan and Kosovo. I work  with these dedicated people and see the significant  efforts they are making to mainstream resolution 1325  (2000) and related resolutions and to integrate the  gender perspective into operations.    Experience to date has shown that having gender  expertise, as well as having more female soldiers in  theatre, improves our ability to conduct operations  more effectively. For example, we have learned that  female soldiers in Afghanistan are at times able to better  connect with members of the population otherwise  closed off from their male colleagues. This has led to  greater awareness of the specific situation and area,  and led to better dialogue and understanding between  NATO forces and the local community. Our experience  has also shown that training and education are strategic  tools for security forces and for defence and security  sector reform. Ifused correctly, they can be major force  multipliers, as the attitudes of those trained can spread  to walks of life beyond the security sphere.    As Council members are aware, the mandate of  the ISAF mission was recently renewed, and the plans  to hand over full security responsibility from ISAF  forces to their Afghan counterparts are on course, as  reaffirmed at the Chicago Summit. Throughout the  transition process and beyond, we will continue to  focus on gender-related training and to support the  recruitment and retention of women in the security  forces.    NATO works shoulder to shoulder with other  international organizations maintaining international  peace and security, and we seek to strengthen further  our cooperation with the United Nations and others to  make sure we learn from each other's experiences and  pave the way for greater efficiency and more results.    Since my appointment as the NATO Secretary  General's Special Representative for Women,  Peace and Security, I have had the great pleasure of  engaging in dialogue with women's associations in  the security sector, womens' rights activists, female  parliamentarians and other representatives of civil  society. I intend to deepen this dialogue.    NATO and its member States remain committed  to upholding human rights and the rule of law. As  we face up to the security challenges of the twenty-  first century, we will continue to work with partners  and other members of the international community to  achieve better security and the greater empowerment  of women."

      "Text": "Mr. Matussek (Germany): Germany aligns  herself with the statement made by Sweden on behalf  of the European Union. As a member of the Group of  Friends of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), we  attach great importance to the issue of women and  peace and security. I would like to thank you,  Mr. President, for holding this open debate.    Women and children need to be protected from  violence. Every day, we bear witness to unspeakable  09-54249    atrocities. This is especially the case in post-conflict  situations in which police protection does not exist and  judicial systems lie in shatters. Institutions need to be  rebuilt, but protection cannot wait until the systems are  fully functional. Protection must take place from the  very first minute of peacebuilding - for the benefit of  the victims but also for the benefit of the whole  community, since rape and sexual violence destroy the  very components of societies. Thus, sustainable peace  cannot be achieved without the protection of the most  vulnerable, namely, women and children.    Women are not only victims of conflicts but  powerful agents for peace and security. Therefore, the  empowerment of women to fulfil this potential is of the  utmost importance. The system of granting  microcredits to women has proved successful within  the context of development cooperation. Empowering  women would also help in security sector reform as  well as disarmament, demobilization and reintegration  processes. Women need to be included in peace  negotiations and in decision-making processes for  rebuilding countries and societies after they have been  torn apart by war. Only by including the gender  perspective in these efforts can a thorough, sustainable  and all-inclusive peace be achieved.    What can Member States do? I will give the  Council just a few examples. Germany has advocated  the inclusion of gender advisers in all European  Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) missions. The  mission of the European Union-led peacekeeping force  in the Democratic Republic of the Congo had, for the  first time, such an adviser among its personnel. During  Germany's presidency, gender advisers were part of all  ESDP missions. Also, the deployment of female  soldiers enhanced the success of operations. For  example, the presence of female soldiers to check  women and children at checkpoints proved to  de-escalate the situation on the ground. In Cambodia,  Germany supports a project of the Ministry of  Women's and Veteran's Affairs that focuses on  capacity-building and gender mainstreaming. Finally,  all German police and military personnel must undergo  gender training.    What can the United Nations do? Security Council  resolution 1888 (2009) and resolution 1889 (2009),  adopted today, are yet another milestone in the fight  against sexual violence and for the empowerment of  women for the maintenance of peace and security. We  now have a whole range of tools available to prevent  3  sexual violence and to respond rapidly to situations in  which violence occurs. The new composite gender  entity that the General Assembly has decided to  establish as part of system-wide coherence will help to  coordinate these and all other instruments that already  exist within the United Nations. I echo the presidency  of the European Union in calling upon the Secretary-  General and his Deputy to quickly start working on the  establishment of this entity.    Let me suggest and reiterate three more targets.  The United Nations needs to continue working together  with women's non-governmental organizations on the  ground in post-conflict areas. It has to strive to include  more women in peacekeeping missions at all levels and  to improve its own performance, but also to set an  example for the countries concerned. And United  Nations entities must expand their activities related to  the delivery of basic services that women in post-  conflict situations need, especially access to health  care, education and justice systems.    Next year is the tenth anniversary of resolution  1325 (2000). Let us try to reach these targets by that  date so we will be able to proclaim some progress that  will benefit and guide all people in the world that need  our help and look to us for support."

      "Text": "Mr. Mwakawago (United Republic of Tanzania):  It gives my delegation particular pleasure to see you,  Sir, presiding over this open debate on women and  peace and security. My delegation warmly welcomes  the convening of this meeting and hopes that the  outcome of this historic debate will contribute to a  better understanding of the gender dimension of peace  processes.    It is significant that in recognition of the  importance that your country attaches to this issue, the  seminar on \"Mainstreaming a Gender Perspective in  Multidimensional Peace Support Operations\" was held  in Windhoek from 29 to 31 May 2000. In this regard  my delegation supports the Namibia Plan of Action and  the call made to the Secretary-General to ensure that  appropriate follow-up measures are undertaken to  implement it.    This debate on women, peace and security is an  important reminder to all of us of the need to resolve  conflicts, particularly those in Africa and elsewhere  which are of grave concern to all of us. Due to these  conflicts, about six million Africans are refugees and  over 15 million people are displaced, between 60 and  80 per cent of whom are women and children.    The 2000 Machel review points out, in chapter 5,  that:    \"During armed conflict, women and girls are  continually threatened by rape, domestic  violence, sexual exploitation, trafficking, sexual  humiliation and mutilation.\"    They are at risk in all settings - be it at home, in flight  or in camps. In some cases, systematic rape and terror  are used as weapons of war. After having been  subjected to such atrocities, they are left with scars that  take longer to heal.    There is no denying that it is women who  shoulder the responsibility of supporting their families  and communities. Women serve alongside their male  counterparts in times of war. It is also women who  serve at the forefront of peace movements. Under these  circumstances, it is evident that we cannot continue  excluding women from conflict resolution processes.  Expanding the role of women in this area is imperative,  not only to address inequities but also to ensure that  our societies benefit from their approaches to  preventing conflicts, solving conflicts and building  peace.    Being direct victims of violence and  discrimination, women have gained a great  understanding of the need to address peace  comprehensively. It is encouraging to note that given  the prevalence of conflicts, particularly in Africa today,  women have taken some initiatives to promote peaceful  resolution of conflicts and to generate a culture of  peace. In this context, the role of Burundian women in  the peace process in their country - and the  recognition of that role by President Nelson Mandela,  the Facilitator of the Burundi peace process - should  serve as an example and as a source of inspiration to  the international community. It is the hope of my  delegation that the Council will adopt a resolution that  gives due weight to the role that women can play in  peace negotiations and accord them due recognition.  The international community needs, therefore, to agree  on a framework that guarantees women that right.    Both the final outcome document of the twenty-  third special session of the General Assembly entitled  \"Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace  for the twenty-first century\" and the Millennium  Summit Declaration place emphasis on shared  responsibility to maintain international peace and  security. On the occasion of International Women's  Day on 8 March, the then President of the Security  Council, Ambassador Chowdhury of Bangladesh,  observed in a statement to the Press:    \"Members of the Council note that although  women have begun to play an important role in  conflict resolution, peacekeeping and peace-  building, they are still under-represented in  decision-making in regard to conflict. If women  are to play an equal part in security and  maintaining peace, they must be empowered  politically and economically, and represented  adequately at all levels of decision-making, both  at the pre-conflict stage and during hostilities, as  well as at the point of peacekeeping, peace-  building, reconciliation and reconstruction.\"    In reiterating this position, we call on the international  community and Governments to intensify efforts aimed  at the realization of the objective set out in that  statement, including the enhancement of the role of  women in various phases of the transition to peace and  post-conflict reconstruction."

      "Text": "Mr. Oyarzun Marchesi (Spain) (spoke in Spanish):  If my voice sounds shaky, it is because I find it very  difficult to speak in this Chamber after Nadia. The walk  from my office to the Chamber today was a peaceful  one. I am lucky not to live in a conflict situation. I am  lucky not to know first-hand what human trafficking is.  I am lucky not to know what sexual violence in conflict  1s.    The closest I have ever been to such situations was  in March when the Secretary-General inaugurated the  Permanent Memorial to Honour the Victims of Slavery  and the Transatlantic Slave Trade at the entrance of  United Nations Headquarters. And I remember that at  that event he said clearly that the monument should lead  us not to forget the past but should above all make us  look to the future - and to take a look at the present  and at human trafficking, which is nothing less than the  modern form of slavery.    I therefore would begin by urging all representatives  and Members of the Organization to look at the Memorial  every time we enter United Nations Headquarters, and  to think of people such as Nadia who have not had the  life the rest of us have had and use all the tools we have  within our reach to fight with greater steadfastness  against human trafficking and sexual violence in  conflict.    I believe the presidential statement adopted today  (S/PRST/2015/25) is a good step in the right direction  but it is certainly not enough. And I congratulate the  Permanent Representative of the United States for  having awakened our consciences this afternoon to  the phenomenon of trafficking, which is something  of which we should really be ashamed. It is probably  one of the most deplorable phenomena currently being  experienced by humankind.    I would like to share two preliminary observations  with the Council, before attempting to propose some  additional measures to fight effectively against human  trafficking. My first observation is that sexual violence  strategically exercised by Daesh and other terrorist  groups can considerably increase the likelihood that  women and girls will be trafficked. I would like to  reiterate the words of the President of the Spanish  Government, who said a few weeks ago that it is more  dangerous to be a woman in armed conflicts than to be  a soldier. That is a very sobering remark.    My second observation is that it is unacceptable for  trafficking in women and children to be a part of the  political economy, or worse, the financial economy, of  terrorist groups. We must fight against this phenomenon  in an absolute and across-the-board manner.    Further, I would refer to two errors that we  simply should not make. The first is believing that the  phenomenon is limited only to Daesh; it is not limited  to Daesh, as the Deputy Secretary-General also said.  Let us keep in mind the 276 girls kidnapped from the  secondary school in Chibok. I think it is important  not to lose sight of that fact. The second is that human  trafficking is not a phenomenon exclusively linked to  terrorism. Rather, it is a phenomenon that is also linked  to the major conflicts we are experiencing today and  the huge number of refugees in the world. Refugees  and displaced persons give rise to making trafficking a  phenomenon that is easier to practice.    Turning now to the United Nations, I believe that,  although the existing legal architecture was inadequate  to help Nadia, and I completely understand that it  was, we need to begin by implementing it much more  effectively, in particular the Palermo Protocol and  other instruments. I can say with pride that my country,  Spain, recently approved a comprehensive plan of  action to fight trafficking in women and children for  the years 2015-2018, in order to ensure that there is no  recurrence of cases such as Nadia's.    Secondly, in strengthening the role of United  Nations and the Security Council in fighing human  trafficking, we must think about incorporating in the  mandates of sanctions committees such serious and  humbling subjects for humankind as the trafficking in  persons.    I would conclude by discussing the victims.  Council members know that my country has been a  standard-bearing country for defending the victims  of terrorism. We organized an Arria Formula meeting  of the Security Council at which, for the first time,  victims of terrorism were able to express themselves.  Today Ambassador Power made it possible for Nadia, a  victim of trafficking, to bravely take the floor and tell  her truth in the Security Council.    Finally, ifbeing a victim of terrorism is serious, one  can imagine how much more serious it would be to be  a victim of terrorism and trafficking at the same time.  Accordingly, I would address Nadia personally and  assure her that the delegation of Spain will continue to  fight to keep experiences like hers from ever recurring.  I hope that within a few years we will no longer need  United Nations funds to help people whose lives have  been as difficult as hers has been."

      "Text": "Mr. Tanin (Afghanistan): I thank you, Madam  President, for organizing such an important meeting,  and congratulations on your leadership of the Council  this month. I would also like to thank previous speakers  for their statements and the Secretary-General for  his recent report (S/2014/693) on women and peace  and security. I look forward to his global study of  the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and the  upcoming high-level review of the resolution.    This debate could not have come at a more timely  moment. War and conflict affect more lives today - all  over the world, but particularly in Afghanistan and  the wider region - than at any time in recent history.  Millions of families have been forced to flee their  homes, and millions of women and children have been  left vulnerable, bearing the brunt of the burden of those  tragic circumstances.    The people of Afghanistan, particularly women  and girls, have suffered immensely as a result of  almost 40 years of war and conflict. The violence in  my country has shattered their lives, interrupted their  educations, threatened their livelihoods, destroyed  their communities and pushed them from their homes  to other countries or to unfamiliar cities and slums.    Afghanistan's refugee situation remains the largest  protracted such situation in the world, and this year  the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) has  increased due to a resurgence of insecurity in parts  of the country. Women suffer disproportionately in  situations of displacement. They often lack access  to the most basic services and resources and are at a  higher risk of discrimination and human rights abuses.    In the past year, there has been a rise in the violent  activities of the Taliban, terrorists groups and other  anti-Government armed opposition and the greatest  increase in civilian deaths ofthe past 13 years, including  many of women and girls. The Taliban and other  anti-Government elements continue to launch targeted  attacks and intimidation campaigns against women  from all spectrums of society, from schoolgirls to  female leaders, including women police officers, human  rights defenders, media personnel and politicians.  Insecurity has also hampered the Government's ability  to prosecute human rights abusers and uphold the rule  of law, thereby exacerbating women's vulnerability  to sexual and gender-based violence, domestic abuse,  harassment, forced marriage and other crimes.    Despite those challenges, Afghanistan has arrived  at an important turning point that offers tremendous  opportunity for strengthened progress on the women  and peace and security agenda. Last month, the new  President was inaugurated, representing the first  democratic transition from one elected president to the  next in the country's history. In this year's presidential  and provincial council elections, millions of women  participated as voters, and hundreds played a significant  role as candidates and as campaigners, despite facing  threats and intimidation. Their involvement set the tone  for an Afghanistan in which women participate and  contribute equally to the country's future.    President Ghani Ahmadzai and the national unity  Government are committed to women's full and  equal participation at all levels of governance and  decision-making. The President made that clear in his  inaugural address, in which he pledged to promote  women's advancement in Afghanistan and praised his  wife, Rula Ghani, for the role she would play as an  active public figure dedicated to promoting women's  rights. This gesture is a first for our young democracy.    Just a few days ago, Afghanistan signed the women  and peace and security national action plan, which aims  to make progress on the four main areas ofparticipation,  protection, conflict prevention and relief and recovery.  We appreciate the Government of Finland's support for  the development of the plan and remain committed to  implementing the women and peace and security agenda  through key institutions and the national action plan for  the women of Afghanistan. We are also dedicated to  promoting the participation of women in the security  sector and aim to increase the number of women police  officers from the current 2,230 to 10,000 by 2017.    As Afghanistan prepares for the full transfer  of security responsibility from international to  Afghan forces at the end of 2014, the President and  new leadership of the country are committed to a  comprehensive reform agenda. Over the next two  years, Afghanistan will hold district and parliamentary  elections, reform electoral laws, convene a loya jirga to  consider amendments to the Constitution and conduct  a reinvigorated outreach and reconciliation process  with the armed opposition. Throughout, the active role  of all segments of the Afghan population, particularly  Afghan women, will be essential. The Government of  Afghanistan believes adamantly that their participation  is critical to preserving and enhancing the gains of the  past 12 years and to the future stability, democracy,  prosperity and peace of the country. In that regard,  the international community's continued support for  Afghanistan's efforts to advance women's rights and  status remains crucial.    Afghan women have suffered immensely as a  result of Taliban rule, extremism and decades of war.  Only when they are free from violence, want and fear  will we be able to secure stability and lasting peace  in Afghanistan. For those reasons, we welcome the  opportunities provided to us by the upcoming twentieth  anniversary of the Beijing Conference on Women, the  fifteenth anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000) and the  adoption of the sustainable development goals to make  further progress on the issue of women and peace and  security, and the agenda for women in Afghanistan and  for women around the world."

      "Text": "Mr. Pfanzelter (Austria): Austria fully endorses  the statements of the European Union and the Human  Security Network. Allow me to elaborate a few points.    In 2000, Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)  called for women's equal participation and full  involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and  promotion of peace and security. Little progress has  been made since then. Women remain marginalized in  the process of peacebuilding and post-conflict  reconstruction.    At the 2005 world summit a few weeks ago, our  heads of States and Governments reaffirmed their  commitment to the full and effective implementation of  resolution 1325 (2000) and to the Beijing Declaration  and Platform for Action.    Austria firmly believes that women must be able  to participate fully in peace negotiations, peace  agreements and the development of a stable society.  Now, the creation of the Peacebuilding Commission  provides us with a unique opportunity to ensure the  involvement of women in United Nations-led  peacebuilding processes. Let us use this opportunity by  integrating a gender perspective in both the mandate  and the structure of that new United Nations body. That  concept is contained in the letter addressed by women  foreign ministers - including Austrian Foreign  Minister Ursula Plassnik - to the Secretary-General  and the President of the General Assembly.    The Peacebuilding Commission should ensure, as  part of its mandate, that women and women's groups  are represented in peace processes, thus enabling them  to play a meaningful role. Concerning the structure of  the Peacebuilding Commission, Member States and  organizations involved in its work should bear in mind  the desirability of gender balance in all meetings of the  Peacebuilding Commission. Austria believes that a  gender advisor should participate in all meetings of the  Peacebuilding Commission in its country-specific  configurations in accordance with paragraph 100 of the  summit outcome document.    Moreover, special representatives, special envoys  and other emissaries involved in peace negotiations  should have firm guidelines to enhance women's  participation in peace processes and transitional  structures. Experience shows that a determined policy  on the part of the international community in the  immediate post-conflict phase in favour of women's  participation, inter alia by ensuring that post-conflict  legislation gives them a right to participate, can  increase the long-term participation of women in  political processes in their countries.    As an example, the Organization for Security and  Cooperation in Europe, which is currently taking  action to enhance implementation of resolution 1325  (2000), has, with its handbook on monitoring women's  participation, already achieved important results  regarding the role of women in elections as voters,  candidates and officials.    Austria welcomes the United Nations system-  wide action plan for the implementation of resolution  1325 (2005) proposed by the Secretary-General in his  report. We now have a window of opportunity, with the  United Nations reform process. It is up to each of us -  Member States and the United Nations - to seize this  opportunity and enhance women's participation in  conflict prevention, peacemaking, peacebuilding and  post-conflict reconstruction."

      "Text": "Ms. Mayanja: It is a privilege to address the  Council at this open debate and to introduce the report  of the Secretary-General on women, peace and security  (S/2006/770). Let me begin by expressing gratitude to  you, Mr. President, for convening this crucially  important meeting on the roles of women in the  consolidation of peace. I am also deeply heartened by  the Council's continued commitment to the  implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).    The Council has before it the report of the  Secretary-General on women, peace and security,  prepared in response to the request of the Council  contained in its presidential statement  S/PRST/2005/52. The report contains a comprehensive  and candid assessment of the first eight months of  carrying out the System-wide Action Plan for the  implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), in support  of activities and commitments by Governments and  civil society. The assessment identifies progress and  challenges in the implementation of the Plan and offers  measures to redress the shortcomings. The Plan has  proved to be a useful tool for strengthened inter-agency  coordination.    The consolidation of peace is an opportunity to  redress grievances and problems that led to conflict in  the first place. It holds the promise of establishing  equality in a democratic environment and reforming  institutions in ways that enable women to take full  advantage of opportunities presented through the  restoration of peace. Yet, the past year has  demonstrated that our collective efforts to ensure equal  participation by women in the consolidation of peace  have thus far generally fallen short of what is required.  From the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the  Sudan, and from Somalia to Timor Leste, women  continue to be exposed to violence or to be targeted by  parties to a conflict, as well as to be marginalized in  formal processes, in particular as regards issues of war  and peace.    It is axiomatic that States, in particular those  emerging from conflict situations, and their  Governments have a vested interest in maintaining  peace and security, and hence in bringing about the  06-58727    political reorganization of society and establishing  credible institutions that can result in human security  for all, in particular for women and girls. However, it is  no secret that, even with political will at the top and  pressure from women's groups below, many  Governments are generally hesitant to challenge pre-  conflict societal values and norms that are often deeply  patriarchal and wedded to customary practices. To  overcome that challenge, the following four conditions  should be met.    First, the international community should  summon all possible political will in order to meet its  commitments to women in the realm of peace and  security. Secondly, at the national level, Governments  should establish clear accountability systems for the  implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). Thirdly, the  Security Council should provide more effective  leadership to monitor progress in the implementation in  the field and should encourage States to do more. And  finally, States and United Nations entities should  allocate sufficient resources and capacities for the  national implementation of the resolution.    A frank and constructive discussion on how to  meet those and other challenges related to national  implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) was held on  23 October. It underlined the critical importance of  national implementation as the key to achieving  sustainable peace and the equal participation of women  in peace processes. Within that framework, the  International Research and Training Institute for the  Advancement of Women last month released \"Securing  equality, engendering peace: a guide to policy and  planning on women, peace and security\".    The full and effective implementation of  resolution 1325 (2000) will require all the will and  creativity the international community can muster. We  can succeed in achieving sustainable peace if we -  Member States, United Nations entities and civil  society - put our minds to it and use the tools,  resources and knowledge at our disposal to fully  empower women. For its part, the United Nations will  remain a strong partner for Member States and civil  society. I look forward to working with everyone in  that quest."

      "Text": "Mr. Mahiga (United Republic of Tanzania): My  delegation is pleased to participate in this open meeting  on the third anniversary of the adoption of the historic  Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women  and peace and security. I should like to express my  delegation's appreciation to Under-Secretary-General  Jean-Marie Guehenno for his opening remarks, which  we found to be useful and very helpful in this debate.  Similarly, we greatly appreciate the presence of Ms.  Amy Smythe, Senior Gender Adviser of the United  Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic  Republic of the Congo. The first-hand information that  she has provided about her experiences and about the  challenges in the field merits our careful and serious  consideration. The demonstrated catalytic role of the  Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and  Advancement of Women, under the leadership of Ms.  Angela King, is also highly appreciated, and we  encourage Ms. King to persevere on that path.    The adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) was an  acknowledgement of the importance of the role of  women in conflict prevention and resolution and in  peace-building. It was a further acknowledgement of  the fact that women not only are disproportionate  victims in conflicts but also assume a variety of roles  during and after conflict, including those of civilian  combatants, peace activists and participants in  reconstruction efforts. It was also an acknowledgement  of the need to involve women fully in the maintenance  and promotion of peace and security and to make that  role concrete and visible.    Resolution 1325 (2000) prescribes a role for all  players. Three years after its adoption, it is evident that  there is a gap between resolve and reality. It is obvious  that, for resolution 1325 (2000) to become a reality,  Member States must take action commensurate with  operationalizing the provisions of the resolution.    That leads me to pose a few questions. Have we  been able to give meaning to the resolution by  incorporating gender perspectives into all peacekeeping  operations? Have we been able to allocate adequate  resources - including human resources- to permit  gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping operations?  Have we made any provisions for the required training  of staff, consistent with the resolution?    At this juncture, it is important for me to  acknowledge the appointment of an interim Gender  Adviser in the Department of Peacekeeping  Operations. That is certainly a welcome development,  which, my delegation believes, signifies the relevance  and importance of resolution 1325 (2000). While we  express the hope that the Gender Adviser will  champion the incorporation of gender perspectives into  peacekeeping operations, it is important to ensure that  her Office has the requisite support and cooperation  from the United Nations system as well as from  Member States. We appreciate the fact that the position  of a Senior Gender Adviser is being earmarked for the  peacekeeping mission in Liberia. We hope that that will  be standard practice in future.    I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to share  with the Council efforts that have been made in the  regions of East Africa and Southern Africa to give  meaning to resolution 1325 (2000). Conflict situations  have amply demonstrated women's abilities to take  active and leading roles in resolving conflicts. Women  in the region are progressively taking a keen interest in  issues related to peace and security. Political and  military establishments and armed groups are  increasingly becoming aware of the role and potential  of women in those areas. Women, on their own, are  also increasingly becoming a powerful constituency in  advancing their role in peace and security issues and  have proved to be essential in that area. The  involvement of women in the Burundi peace process is  a case in point.    In the broader context of gender mainstreaming,  we within the Southern African Development  Community (SADC), have set for ourselves the goal of  reaching a minimum target of 30 per cent  representation by women in politics and in decision-  making structures by 2005. The overall regional  situation indicates that SADC member States are  making progress in that regard. At least two member  States have provided for representation by women in  their respective constitutional amendments. Women's  combat experiences and their civilian roles in the  liberation movements of many of these countries have  proved valuable and have paved the way for the logical  involvement of women in post-conflict governance,  reconciliation and nation-building.    There is a deliberate, gradual increase in the  proportion of representation by women in various  structures in most member States. As most member  States in the region are expected to hold general  elections in 2004 and 2005, it is expected that they will  use the opportunities of those forthcoming elections  and other measures to advance and achieve the  immediate minimum target of 30 per cent. The process  of women's empowerment will continue thereafter. The  imperative is not to give token attention to women's  participation, but to acknowledge the fact that the  foundation for durable peace, development, good  governance, human rights and justice lies in women  playing a full part as equal partners in all peace  processes and in the maintenance of peace.    My country, Tanzania, is working closely with the  Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees to ensure the security of refugees, including  women and girls, as well as to ensure the humanitarian  and civilian nature of refugee camps and settlements.    As we in the Great Lakes region prepare for an  international conference on peace, security, democracy  and development in the Great Lakes region to be held  in June 2004, we are gratified to note that women have  carved out a niche for themselves as important  participants in the preparatory process leading to the  conference.    While we take note of the few positive steps  towards the implementation of Security Council  resolution 1325 (2000), it should be a matter of  concern to all of us that women still make up only a  small part of those who participate in peace and  security negotiations. They continue to be marginalized  in most post-conflict planning. My delegation believes  that resolution 1325 (2000) is a powerful instrument in  our hands. Our challenge is to put that instrument to  work to achieve the results it is intended to accomplish.  That can happen only if we harness the political will to  allocate the necessary funding, to identify the requisite  staffing and to provide the training that is required to  make resolution 1325 (2000) a way of our political life.  Today's debate is a valuable contribution in sustaining  the momentum for change in that direction. The trend  towards empowering women has generated its own  dynamic, which cannot be ignored or reversed."

      "Text": "Mr. Nsengimana (Rwanda): My delegation  welcomes this opportunity to participate in this open  debate on women and peace and security, and wishes to  express our appreciation to the delegation of the  People's Republic of China for convening it. We also  thank the Secretary-General for his report (S/2008/622)  on women and peace and security, which offers an  assessment of the state of implementation of resolution  1325 (2000) and the challenges that remain.    I also would like to thank the Special Adviser to  the Secretary-General, Ms. Rachel Mayanja; Under-  Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations,  Mr. Alain Le Roy; the Executive Director of the United  Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM),  Ms. Ines Alberdi; and Ms. Sarah Taylor, Coordinator of  the NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and  Security, for their fruitful and comprehensive  interventions on the present situation of women  regarding peace and security.    The genocide in Rwanda in 1994 witnessed some  of the most inhumane acts of violence targeted at  women and girls and the use of sexual violence as a  tactic of genocide. The survivors of the genocide  continue to live with the consequences of those crimes  almost 15 years later. The perpetrators of these heinous  crimes, the ex-forces armees rwandaises and  interahamwe, now the Forces democratiques de  liberation du Rwanda (FDLR), have been a main cause  of regional insecurity in the Great Lakes region since  1994 and continue to be a major factor in the current  situation in the eastern Democratic Republic of the  Congo. The FDLR continues to commit war crimes,  crimes against humanity and numerous other human  rights violations in the Great Lakes region.    Many regional and international agreements and  instruments provide commendable mechanisms to deal  with the threat posed by FDLR, but little or no attempt  has been made to translate them into action. It is  imperative that those agreements be put into action  promptly to enable a lasting solution to the problem,  which further threatens women in the Great Lakes  region.    The equal participation of women in the  promotion of peace and security in both conflict and  post-conflict situations is integral to any peacekeeping,  peacemaking or peacebuilding process. It is in that  context that my Government has set out to ensure that  women are central to the political, economic and social  governance of our nation. Women today hold 56 per  cent of seats in Parliament; head the Foreign,  Information and Education Ministries, among others;  head the police force and participate in peacekeeping  missions; and hold command positions in the armed  forces.    The participation of women in the maintenance  and promotion of peace can begin to manifest itself  only through sheer political will. The Government of  Rwanda has made it abundantly clear that governance  without the participation of more than of half the  population is not governance.    Rwanda is a major troop-contributing country to  United Nations peacekeeping operations and has a  vested interest in preventing sexual violence in  situations of armed conflict. Therefore, the Rwanda  Defence Forces (RDF) considers gender-based  violence and violence against women to be main  components of the security threat. In that respect, the  gender desk at Rwanda Defence Headquarters devises  training programmes with the support of UNIFEM. to  raise awareness of gender-based violence and violence  against women in the armed forces.    Awareness of and training in how to respond to  gender-based violence and violence against women has  now been mainstreamed into the curriculum of all of  Rwanda's military schools and training institutions and  is integral to the preparation of all RDF battalions  preparing for peacekeeping missions abroad. The  participation of Rwandan policewomen in  peacekeeping missions in the Sudan has further  ensured that they raise awareness among the  population in support of their missions.    We welcome the Secretary-General's report  calling for an increase in resources and support to  Governments in conflict or post-conflict situations to  ensure the increased participation of women in the  maintenance and promotion of peace. We also look  forward to the establishment of a strengthened and  consolidated United Nations gender entity.    My Government therefore reiterates its support  for the continued implementation of Security Council  resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) and the  Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples'  Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa and will  remain a strong advocate for the participation of  women in all aspects of governance."

      "Text": "Mr. Reynders (Belgium) (spoke in French): Let  me begin by thanking the Secretary-General for the  report on conflict-related sexual violence (S/2012/33).  I also wish to thank Ms. Margot Wallstrom, Special  Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual  Violence in Conflict, and her team of experts. It is  impossible to remain indifferent in reading the report,  for sexual violence in many societies is still a common  practice, often invisible and too rarely prosecuted.    Belgium has always been a strong defender of  resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security.  It formally promises to remain so.    Belgium associates itself with the statement to be  made on behalf of the European Union.    I would like to address three subjects.    First is the mandate of the Special  Representative, which for Belgium is very clear. It  allows the Security Council to focus on sexual violence  not only in classic conflict situations but also in  post-conflict situations or other serious situations, such  as political unrest. The Council already regularly takes  up such issues in various types of situations. I welcome  the reference in the report to instances of sexual  violence in situations of unrest and instability,  particularly in Egypt and Syria. To reduce the mandate    12-2393]  solely to cases of sexual violence in conflict situations  would be tantamount to restricting the role of the  United Nations in defending individuals and societies  that suffer from this terrible scourge. We cannot retreat  from the detailed mandate set out in resolution 1960  (2010).    Furthermore, while sexual Violence mainly  affects women and girls, the Secretary-General's report  makes very clear that the situation of men, especially  those in custody, as well as children born as a result of  rape, deserves greater attention from us. Rather than  seeking to lock the mandate into too limited an area of  action, we should develop a comprehensive approach  to protecting civilians.    My second comment concerns some particular  recommendations in the report, first, that concerning  initiatives and modalities relating to security sector  reform, It is indeed our duty to ensure that those who  perpetrate, command or condone sexual violence are  excluded from all branches of government, including  the armed forces and police. In addition, United  Nations mediators and officials also must ensure that  sexual violence is included in the definition of conduct  prohibited by ceasefire and peace agreements. Indeed,  Belgium calls particularly for an increase in the  number of women serving as mediators and special  envoys.    Finally, the third recommendation that I wish to  underline concerns prevention, which is often more  effective than reparation. That is why Belgium  supports any initiative aimed at adopting early warning  systems that could detect risks of imminent sexual  violence in regions affected by conflict.    My third and final comment relates to situations  in some particular countries. The Special  Representative has visited the Democratic Republic of  the Congo several times to discuss with top  Government officials the issue of sexual violence,  often committed by military personnel. Belgium was  among the first to provide financial support for the  Democratic Republic of the Congo's national strategy  to combat sexual violence. We also provided financial  support to the United Nations Organization  Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of  the Congo for military judges to assist with the    12-2393]    prosecution of soldiers accused of sexual violence in  the eastern part of the country. Belgium intends to  remain engaged in this project, in consultation with the  Special Representative and with national authorities.    As Chair of the Peacebuilding Commission's  Central African Republic configuration, Belgium  attributes particular importance to the issue of sexual  Violence in that country. The Central African Republic  is on the priority list for action by the Special  Representative. The problem of Violence against  women and children is discussed during each  Commission field visit, and regular contact on the  subject is maintained with the Office of the Special  Representative.    The reports on the situations in Libya, Egypt and  Syria are particularly relevant in the context of the  so-called Arab Spring. The issue of sexual violence in  countries in transition should not be ignored. I am  deeply concerned at reports by the United Nations  commission of inquiry to the effect that Syrian armed  forces and security personnel have used sexual torture  against detainees in various detention centers of the  intelligence and political security services. I trust we  shall have an opportunity to speak of that tomorrow, in  the framework of the meeting of the friends of Syria in  Tunis.    In conclusion, I would like to stress the collective  responsibility for the fight against sexual violence. The  Security Council must act on this report, in particular  by transmitting to the sanctions committees the list of  parties responsible for sexual violence, which is  annexed to the report, for effective follow-up. The  development of that list is a first, for which I  congratulate the Secretary-General.    I sincerely trust that the team of the Special  Representative will continue their excellent work. I  believe their report is one stage and that there will be  more."

      "Text": "Mr. Guerber (Switzerland): I have the honour to  speak on behalf of the Human Security Network,  namely, Austria, Chile, Costa Rica, Greece, Ireland,  Jordan, Mali, Norway, Panama, Slovenia, Thailand,  South Africa as an observer, and my own country,  Switzerland.    We would like to thank the Togolese presidency  for having convened this important open debate on  women, peace and security, an issue that is at the core  of the Human Security Network.    Let us further thank the Secretary-General for his  report and his Special Representative on Sexual  Violence in Conflict, Ms. Margot Wallstrom, for her  outstanding work and commitment to this sensitive and  complex issue. The Human Security Network shares  the views expressed by the Secretary-General in his  recommendations to the Security Council, Member  States, donors and regional organizations.  12-23937    Since the adoption of Security Council resolution  1325 (2000), we have witnessed significant advances  in this field, including resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888  (2009) and 1960 (2010), the creation of the post of the  Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict,  as well as the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and  Sexual Violence in Conflict, which contribute  significantly to strengthening the cooperation between  the United Nations system and Member States in order  to prevent crimes against women and girls. In addition,  they help to improve the efficiency of the national  judicial systems in ensuring the rule of law and  bringing perpetrators to justice, including to the  International Criminal Court.    However, it is deeply disturbing that today we  continue to witness rapes of women, girls and children  in general, in countries in armed conflict but also in  other situations, including post-conflict situations. We  recognize the efforts made by some Governments to  put an end to these crimes, to strengthen judicial  systems and to bring those responsible to justice.  However, as the Secretary-General's report (S/2012/33)  shows, progress remains slow, and in practice the  perpetrators of crimes against women and girls often  go unpunished.    The Human Security Network therefore urges  Member States to increase their efforts to prevent  conflict-related sexual violence by undertaking all  necessary efforts to implement all applicable legal  provisions in the matter. The primary responsibility is  theirs. But, at the same time, this constitutes a  challenge for the international community as a whole,  especially for regional and subregional organizations.  Their role in supporting the efforts of those countries is  crucial. The message must be clear; there shall be no  impunity for the perpetrators of such crimes, and the  countries affected and the international community will  not rest until there is accountability and justice is done.    The provision of genuine support, protection and  the relevant services to the victims and their families is  equally as important as rendering justice. In that  context, the support given at the community level is  vital. Projects that directly assist victims and their  families to help them overcome the trauma inflicted  upon them are of particularly great value.    One of the key issues in a post-conflict country is  security sector reform. Security is not a \"men's issue\";  it is a gender issue, and women must be involved in all    relevant discussions and negotiations from their  inception, and they must also be part of the higher  military ranks, which is where security-related issues  are usually discussed. The gender perspective must be  part of the reform and training of all security forces.    The Human Security Network emphasizes the  importance of the full and equal participation of  women in political processes, including in  peacemaking and peacebuilding. Their involvement  ensures the success of those processes. At the same  time, conflict-related sexual violence and the specific  needs of women and girls have to be addressed  adequately, both in ceasefire agreements and in peace  agreements.    Preventing crimes is as crucial as delivering  justice and supporting the victims. To that end, we  have to be able to improve the early warning systems  and monitoring mechanisms already in place and to  build upon them where needed. They must be capable  of detecting signs of possible crimes and must mobilize  the political and judicial authorities in order to prevent  them. They must involve all relevant levels, from the  community level to the provincial and national levels.  Regional organizations can also play an important role  in the creation of an efficient early warning system.    Finally, we appreciate the information provided  on the progress made in implementing the monitoring,  analysis and reporting arrangements. The collection of  timely, accurate, reliable and objective information on  conflict-related sexual violence is crucial to tailoring  the Council's responses, as well as to enhancing action  to prevent sexual violence. We also wish to encourage  the deployment of women protection advisers to United  Nations peacekeeping and special political missions in  order to strengthen the response of the relevant mission  components to conflict-related sexual violence.    We strongly hope that the Council will be able to  reach an agreement on the presidential statement later  today.    (spoke in French)    I will now make a statement in my national  capacity. A more detailed version of my statement can  be found in the distributed text.    Resolutions 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010) on  women and peace and security constitute a robust  machinery, which demonstrates that the Security  Council and United Nations members are firmly    resolved to move from advocacy to the effective  implementation of their commitment to combat  conflict-related sexual violence. The establishment of  new mandates always raises the crucial issue of  coordination and the efficient use of existing  structures.    We welcome the fact that it is intended to  preserve the full flexibility of the monitoring, analysis  and reporting arrangements in order to adapt them to  the country-specific needs and circumstances. In that  regard, we would like to underscore the importance of  the continued and transparent communication of the  Office of the Special Representative with United  Nations country teams so as to foster ownership and  results-oriented implementation of the new structures  and processes in the field.    We note with great satisfaction that several  activities have been launched with UN-Women. We  hope that such productive cooperation will continue.  Switzerland recently contributed 3 million Swiss francs  to the United Nations Trust Fund to End Violence  against Women, which is administered by UN-Women.    The Secretary-General's report on conflict-related  sexual violence contains useful recommendations to  the Security Council, Member States and regional  organizations. I would like to recall three of those, in  particular.    First, prevention is a priority as it is an essential  part of our efforts to protect, in which many  stakeholders have a role to play. Specific and time-  bound commitments to put an end to all acts of sexual  violence and to bring their perpetrators to justice can  help to break the cycle of violence.    We strongly support more systematic measures to  enhance protection against sexual violence and  prevention of its recurrence through transitional justice  mechanisms. Such measures should link the fight  against impunity and recognition of victims' rights, for  example through appropriate reparations, but also  include strengthening the national capacity to combat  the causes of violence and, at the same time, to prevent  new cases.    Secondly, in resolution 1820 (2008), the Security  Council resolved to take acts of sexual violence into  consideration when establishing or renewing State-  specific sanctions regimes. That opportunity should not  be forgotten. It thus provides the means to take  targeted measures against, for example, the parties and  individuals mentioned in the Secretary-General's report  on sexual violence in conflict.    Finally, in his report, the Secretary-General calls  on the parties to include training on conflict-related  sexual violence in training programmes for  peacekeeping troops. In that regard, I would like to  draw the Council's attention to the handbook prepared  by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations,  entitled \"Standardized Best Practices Toolkit on  Gender and Policing in Peacekeeping Operations\". The  handbook was co-financed by Switzerland.    The structures set up by resolutions 1888 (2009),  1889 (2009) and 1960 (2010) are still in a testing  phase, and only proof of the reality will make it  possible to assess their effectiveness. The path is steep  and rocky. However, we should move forward  prudently and resolutely in strengthening the protection  architecture. The establishment of the mandate of the  Special Representative of the Secretary-General on  Sexual Violence in Conflict is a significant part of that  course."

      "Text": "Mr. Fedotov: Several tragedies took place  yesterday: the cowardly assassination of the Russian  Ambassador to Turkey and the despicable terrorist  attack in Berlin. May I express, on behalf of the United  Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), my  deepest condolences to the Governments of the Russian  Federation and Germany and to the families of the  victims. As the UNODC mandate includes counter-  terrorism, we stand ready to increase our support to  Member States to strengthen international solidarity  and cooperation in fighting the scourge of terrorism  and hatred.    Turning to the agenda item under consideration,  allow me to begin by expressing my gratitude to the  Security Council for its attention to this urgent issue.  Indeed, this is a historic meeting of the Security  Council, as the Council is set to adopt, for the first time  in its history, an action-oriented resolution dedicated to  human trafficking. I would also like to thank UNODC  Goodwill Ambassador Nadia Murad for helping to raise  awareness of the plight of trafficking victims.    Thanks to these efforts, heightened attention is  being given to the problem of human trafficking in  conflict and mass movements of refugees and migrants,  where we have seen this terrible crime acquire ever  more appalling dimensions.    In seeking to strengthen international responses, we  must keep in sharp focus the fact that human trafficking  is pervasive. It is transnational, and its victims are  everywhere. Trafficking victims have been detected in  106 countries and territories around the world.    Building effective action thus requires a strong  framework of international cooperation and shared  responsibility. I deliberately use the word \"build\", as  there is no single measure, no one step in any given part  of the world that can address this problem alone.    The building blocks we need can be found in the  United Nations Convention against Transnational  Organized Crime and its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress  and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women  and Children. This international treaty, concluded  more than a decade ago, is still young, but some 158  countries have now criminalized most forms of human  trafficking in their domestic laws, in line with the  Protocol. It is true that the full implementation of the  Protocol's provisions has yet to be achieved. However,  the Palermo Convention and the Protocol could serve as  a platform for a vast collective response to many of the  challenges raised by today's debate.    What we really need is to strengthen existing  frameworks, which represent a solid foundation of  international law and years of painstaking operational  cooperation that we can build upon to act against  modern-day slave traders, including in situations  of conflict and wherever we find such activities  taking place.    The report of the Secretary-General (S/2016/949)  details the efforts of the United Nations system to  support Member States in improving the implementation  of this international law instrument.    Tomorrow UNODC will present its 2016 Global  Report on Trafficking in Persons, which it is mandated  to do by the General Assembly and which provides  a snapshot of the state of national responses to the  challenges of human trafficking. The report, based  on reliable data and information provided by Member  States, establishes that an increasing number of  trafficking victims from conflict-affected countries  such as Syria, Iraq and Somalia have been detected  in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. The report also  features a thematic chapter on the connections between  conflict, migration and trafficking. I hope that all  present will join us tomorrow at the launch.    Looking ahead, I would like to highlight the urgent  need for countries to improve identification and referral  processes tailored to the challenges of conflict zones  and mass movements.    UNODC is helping countries to enhance the  identification and protection of trafficking victims  among refugees and displaced persons fleeing conflict  in the Middle East and Africa, and we hope to expand  this work in future. At the same time, strategic law-  enforcement action must target upstream organized  criminals through intelligence-sharing,joint operations,  financial investigations and coordination within and  across borders.    The full arsenal of tools that we have to disrupt  organized crime networks and terrorist groups and to  fight money laundering and counter-terrorism financing  must be deployed. Criminals exploit weakness. Gaps  in our responses abet impunity and leave defenceless  people exposed. UNODC is committed to doing our  part to support the Security Council, to integrate  action against human trafficking, to promote justice  and accountability, and to protect the victimized  and vulnerable."

      "Text": "Mr. Kau (Fiji): We would like to thank you,  Mr. President, for having organized today's debate on  this issue. We also congratulate the Secretary-General  for his timely report on the follow-up to the full  implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) on women  and peace and security (S/2004/814).    While the Secretary-General's report shows that  there have been positive developments in the  implementation of the resolution, further concerted  efforts are needed to ensure that the issue of  implementation is fully addressed. The full  implementation of the resolution will continue to be a  challenge for the Security Council and for the United  Nations.  Fiji attaches great importance to this subject, and  we commend the efforts made thus far by the Security  Council, the General Assembly, the Economic and  Social Council and its functional commissions and  other United Nations bodies and entities. We  commend, in particular, the efforts made by the United  Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and  by regional organizations and other bodies, including  the Commonwealth Secretariat, which have been active  partners in following up this issue in Fiji. Our Ministry  for Women, Social Welfare and Poverty Alleviation has  been the focal point of efforts to mainstream gender  perspectives in relation to critical peace and security  components in Government and other areas.    The necessary groundwork for the launching in  Fiji of national policies and strategies pursuant to  resolution 1325 (2000) has been greatly boosted by the  sponsorship and support of UNIFEM. and other actors,  including civil society. Work on mainstreaming gender  perspectives in relation to conflict prevention,  peacekeeping operations, humanitarian assistance and  post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation is in  progress.    Recent political and internal upheavals in our  country have brought out the best in our women, and  their contribution has been a strong factor for good and  steady progress. They have been effective stabilizers  and mediators in conflict prevention and very active  players in recent efforts in post-conflict peace-building  and reconciliation processes. A week-long peace and  reconciliation process with the objective, inter alia, of  uniting our polarized and divided country, which was  held last month, saw women and children playing key  roles. This was preceded by a national workshop on  conflict prevention and early warning.    In peacekeeping, Fiji, which is a staunch  supporter of and consistent contributor to international  peacekeeping missions, has introduced specific  measures to ensure the expansion of women's role in  peacekeeping. Despite the difficulties in overcoming  cultural and traditional barriers, recent deployments  have seen the successful integration of women into  various specialized duties, including guard duty. The  military and police departments, together with other  relevant bodies, are working on coherent strategies for  gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping. The Fiji  peacekeeping deployment to Iraq will include six  women who have been given specific training in  searching and in counselling. That also illustrates our  view that women can be as good as men in all areas if  given the opportunity.  We fully agree with the Secretary-General that  more effort must be put into capacity-building and  training. Gender mainstreaming in relation to all facets  of peace and security requires knowledge and  information-sharing. Training and capacity-building  must target not only girls and women, but also boys  and men at all levels of government and the  community. It should be all-encompassing and  comprehensive, targeting both the formal and the non-  formal sectors. Its inclusion in the education  curriculum will ensure early intervention and sustained  impact. The Government, through the programmes of  its Ministry for Women and through the UNIFEM-  sponsored Women and Peace and Security Committee,  is addressing the issue with all relevant stakeholders.    In addition, there is a need for more effective  coordination and partnerships. There is certainly no  lack of will and enthusiasm at the national level,  particularly in developing countries, but enhanced  cooperation and partnership are vital to ensure the  inflow of the resources and expertise which are  generally lacking in our countries. We therefore  welcome the call by the Secretary-General for the  development and strengthening of cooperation and  effective partnerships at all levels. We acknowledge the  good work done by UNIFEM. and other United Nations  bodies, together with regional organizations such as the  Pacific Islands Forum and the Commonwealth  Secretariat, in the Pacific region, including in Fiji. We  can only hope for more such cooperation and  partnerships.    We also commend the Secretary-General for his  recognition of the role of indigenous women in conflict  resolution as mediators and peace-builders. Indigenous  and local women have a strong advocacy role, and it  should be utilized in all aspects of security and peace.    There is a need to ensure that national and  international efforts for the implementation of  resolution 1325 (2000) are undertaken in a  comprehensive manner in the context of the  Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of  Discrimination against Women and the Beijing  Declaration and Platform for Action. To ensure  complementarity and proper coordination, every effort  must be undertaken in collaboration with, and within,  existing institutional arrangements.    Fiji has a total population of approximately  800,000, with women making up almost half of that  number. Given our small population, it was easy for us  to recognize the great potential that women represent.  In order to make progress, we had to harness all the  resources at our disposal, and women have played the  prominent role we expected - and more - in the  measured forward momentum towards our  developmental goals. Our support for the efforts of the  Security Council and the Secretary-General in the  furtherance of women's participation in peace and  security is therefore absolute."

      "Text": "Ms. Power (United States of America): Madam  President, I would like thank the Secretary-General,  Special Representative Bangura, and Ms. Misaka for  their informative and powerful briefings.    In the past decade, the Security Council has  identified the scourge of sexual violence in conflict as  a matter of acute and urgent concern. We meet today to  assess progress in combating that pernicious form of  criminality and to consider next steps. We begin with  confidence that the standards we have established are  clear and the terrible knowledge that those standards  are regularly being ignored. We have made abundantly  clear that there should be zero tolerance for rape and  zero tolerance for other forms of sexual abuse in all  circumstances and at all times. The terror of sexual  violence is uniquely horrific and merits our continued  and determined efforts to eliminate it. Neither the fog  of war nor the associated breakdown of law provide  any explanation or excuse for actions that violate the  rights and disrespect the fundamental dignity of human  beings.    To articulate a zero-tolerance standard is, of course,  not difficult. Indeed, we have done it many times. But to  endow it with real meaning in real conflicts remains a  challenge of great urgency and one of many dimensions.  This is not work that should be delegated only to a Special  Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual  Violence in Conflict, even one as capable as Special  Representative Bangura, or to women's protection  advisers in a peacekeeping mission or to UN-Women.  Those offices and officials and the United Nations as  a whole assuredly have an indispensable role to play,  but the key to further progress in reducing suffering  and in protecting the vulnerable is action by the parties  to conflict. Every Government has a responsibility to  establish standards, develop institutions and pursue  policies that protect its people from sexual violence,  whether perpetrated by the Government's own forces  or by others. That responsibility includes, as Special  Representative Bangura just put it, redirecting the  stigma from the survivors to the perpetrators.    That duty extends to men and boys, who have  suffered sexual violence to an extent we have only  recently begun to appreciate - in places like Colombia,  where boys were turned into sex slaves by illegal armed  groups; in Rutshuru, in the Democratic Republic of  the Congo, which was under the savage control of the  Mouvement du 23 mars for much of 2013; and in Libya,  where the United Nations reported that armed brigades  used rape in detention as a form of torture.    In far too many countries, the victims of sexual  violence still have little, if any, effective legal recourse.  Untilthat changes,predators willnotbe deterred, victims  will hesitate to come forward and justice will remain  beyond reach. In places where Governments are weak,  we must help to improve their capabilities while also  holding accountable those who commit crimes. Among  the most culpable are the ruthless militias in the Central  African Republic, whose assaults on civilians have  almost literally torn the country apart, and where rape,  forced marriage and sexual slavery are widespread; in  Burma, where there are widespread reports of soldiers  raping women and girls; and, as we have just heard, in  South Sudan, where only this week militants have gone  on the radio - radio, which my Rwandan colleague has  called an evil multiplier - to incite the use of sexual  violence against named ethnic groups; in Yemen, where  child protection workers have attested to the abduction  and abuse of boys by Ansar Al-Sharia. With all of  that in mind, we should express special outrage at the  continued and widespread incidence of sexual abuse  practised by Syrian Government armed forces as part  of the regime's ruthless campaign to terrorize civilians  and drive families from their homes.    Despite chronic underreporting and difficulties of  access, we know more about the nature and scope of  the problem than ever before. The Secretary-General's  report (S/2014/181), the information-collection  mechanisms on which it is based, and the steadfast  leadership shown by Special Representative Bangura  are all welcome developments. In addressing sexual  violence, the United Nations must set the right  example in what it does both here in New York and in  places around the world where tensions are high and  United Nations peacekeepers or political missions are  deployed. Ms. Bangura has shown determination in  coordinating United Nations efforts across agencies  in order to ensure that the imperative of putting a stop  to sexual violence is addressed in training, included in  mission mandates and reports, and becomes a central  focus of enforcement activities and a major part of  holding perpetrators accountable for war crimes and  crimes against humanity.    As members of the Security Council, however, we  must do our part by exercising proper oversight and  pushing for the full implementation of the objectives  we set, mission by mission. In that connection, I note  that women protection advisers were deployed last year  to Somalia and Mali, and are expected this year in the  Sudan, South Sudan, Cote d'Ivoire and the Central  African Republic. In Somalia, the United Nations  has helped to train 12,000 police officers, and the  Government has supported the increased recruitment  of women police. An improved effort has also been  made to strengthen investigative and prosecutorial  capabilities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,  where sexual violence perpetrated by Government  and rebel forces has long been a source of chronic and  massive injustice.    We must also strive to help the Secretariat  achieve its goal of 20 per cent female participation  among United Nations police. But for that to happen,  each of our countries must themselves increase their  recruitment of women police into their domestic forces,  so that there is a far broader pool on which the United  Nations can draw. We must also insist on enforcing the  absolute prohibition on sexual abuse by United Nations  peacekeepers. Again, that requires that home countries  hold perpetrators of sexual Violence accountable once  they are sent home.    In conclusion, I would like to voice the strong  support of my Government and of the American people  for a concerted strategy across the globe to address the    problem of sexual violence, both in and outside combat  situations. For far too long, such abuses have been  treated as part of the spoils of victory or the rewards  of physical might. Let us be clear: sexual abuse is  among the worst of crimes, because it robs people of  the precious and inalienable right to be secure in their  bodies, and because it is inflicted out of cruelty. In our  efforts to stop it, we have made gains in recent years,  but we have a very long way to go."

      "Text": "Mr. Vilovic' (Croatia): Let me begin by extending  our congratulations to you, Mr. President, and your  delegation on your presidency of the Security Council  for the month of October, and by assuring you of the  full support of my delegation. I also thank you and  your delegation for initiating this meeting and bringing  the Council together to discuss an issue that is  critically important to the Republic of Croatia and,  surely, to all nations.    Allow me to extend a warm welcome to  Ms. Michelle Bachelet and wish her success in her  future work as the first Executive Director of the newly  established gender entity, UN Women, and Under-  Secretary-General for Gender Equality and the  Empowerment of Women. Given her high political  stature and experience, we deem that Ms. Bachelet will  enhance the gender equality agenda and that  UN Women will grow into the principal voice for  gender mainstreaming and the empowerment of  women.  Croatia aligns itself with the statement delivered  by the representative of Belgium on behalf of the  European Union. Here, I would like to make additional  remarks in my national capacity.    The adoption by the Security Council of  resolution 1325 (2000) bears testimony to the progress  made during the past decade in the area of women and  peace and security. This historic resolution has focused  much-needed attention on the question of women's  empowerment, which represents a priority for my  country. While all the resolutions on women and peace  and security are equally important, resolution 1325  (2000) serves as an umbrella resolution in addressing  women's empowerment, their task as peacebuilders and  their fragile position as victims of war.    The Republic of Croatia welcomes the report of  the Secretary-General on the implementation of this  landmark resolution (S/2010/498), the recommendations  contained therein, as well as the presidential statement  adopted by the Council today(S/PRST/2010/22). We  call upon the Security Council to endorse the indicators  developed by the Secretary-General as soon as  possible.    The commitments set forth by the resolution are  commendable, but translating words into action is the  only way of resolving the remaining issues - and the  issues are many. As numerous situations on the agenda  of this Council have shown, women still have a long  way to go in order to fulfil their empowerment goals as  well as to fully realize their human rights, both in times  of war and peace. The empowerment of women is  imperative to the full achievement of human rights, as  well as to overall economic and political development  and progress. Although women are widely recognized  as effective agents of peace, they still have little access  to decision-making positions and peace negotiations.  More should be done.    Armed conflicts continue to have a devastating  impact on women and girls and are often accompanied  by gender-based violence, including the increasing  scale and brutality of sexual violence, often used as a  means of war. Impunity for such acts of violence  against women is still prevalent and the prosecution  rate very low.    Even on Croatian territory, in the heart of Europe,  rape was used as a method of intimidation and terror  during the aggression to which Croatia was exposed in  the early 19905. We are fully aware of the role both the  Security Council and the international community can  play in addressing sexual violence against women and  girls, especially when used by political or military  leaders as a means of achieving political or military  objectives. We believe that the Security Council needs  to provide strong and effective leadership on this issue,  including by taking concrete action when necessary,  with the ultimate aim of eradicating this abhorrent  behaviour. Such acts of violence demand further action  by the Security Council to strengthen the rule of law  and to end impunity. They need to be thoroughly  investigated and perpetrators brought to account, and it  is therefore imperative for the International Criminal  Court, as well as national courts, to be the last instance  of justice for the victims and a reminder that there can  be no tolerance for the crime of rape.    We are pleased to see that progress has been  made in several areas and that the United Nations  system continues to engage in a wide range of good  practices. We encourage the strengthening of the  coordination among United Nations agencies both at  Headquarters and in the field, especially in monitoring  and reporting on situations where parties to armed  conflict engage in rape and other sexual violence as a  means of war. Nevertheless, more consistent and  comprehensive reporting on sexual violence would  enable the Council to address the protection of women  and children in a more systematic manner, whereas the  Council should include specific reporting requirements  in resolutions establishing or renewing mandates.    More needs to be done also at the national level.  The integration of the resolution has to be country-  driven, and Member States need to take responsibility  for its success by ensuring that it is integrated into  national policies. We urge countries to apply a broad  gender-mainstreaming approach across Government,  for instance through a system-wide approach that links  development, humanitarian and defence issues. All  plans should include civil society consultations, as well  as monitoring and reporting mechanisms.    I am pleased to say that Croatia has taken steps to  integrate the gender perspective into its national  security policy through its national strategy for the  promotion of gender equality, and is currently  developing its national action plan on the  implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), which is  expected to be adopted in 2011. Under the leadership  of its first female Prime Minister, Croatia will continue  to give its firm support to all areas of the women and  peace and security agenda. We see it as a gender-based  peace agenda that involves addressing the  disproportionate effect of conflict on women and  combating sexual violence. It is also about securing the  full, equal and effective participation of women at all  stages of the peace process, giving them an equal role  in the prevention and resolution of conflicts, as well as  in peacebuilding. The realization of these goals is  essential to safeguarding basic human rights and  achieving human security and lasting peace."

      "Text": "Mrs. Mladineo (Croatia): Croatia has aligned  itself with the statement made by the representative of  the United Kingdom on behalf of the European Union,  but I would like to add a few points based on Croatia's  specific experience and achievements on the matter.    At the outset, allow me, on behalf of my  delegation, to commend the Romanian presidency for  organizing this open debate to mark the fifth  anniversary of the adoption of Security Council  resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and  security.    Since 2000, the international community has  increasingly come to recognize not only how much  conflict particularly affects women and girls, but also  how often women hold the key to its peaceful  resolution. It will be important to examine ways in  which the provisions of this important cross-cutting  resolution can be better implemented at the regional  and national levels.    Croatia welcomes the United Nations system-  wide action plan produced by the Secretary-General  (see S/2005/636), which aims at highlighting the  importance of gender perspectives in conflict  prevention and peacekeeping activities. In order to  achieve success in the post-war confidence-building  process it is essential to include women as active  participants in post-conflict reintegration and  reconstruction. That has also been borne out by  Croatia's experience.    The protection of women in armed conflict and  women's fundamental role in conflict prevention and  peacebuilding cannot be evaluated without taking into  account that women are among those most affected by  violence and the economic instability resulting from  armed conflict. Yet, when it comes to negotiating  peace, post-war reconstruction and reconciliation,  women are grossly underrepresented. We should  continue to press the main bodies of the United  Nations, particularly its funds and programmes, to  strengthen the participation of women in their work  and to streamline gender issues. Post-conflict  transition, recovery and reconstruction cannot be  achieved if gender equality and the promotion of  women's rights are absent.    Croatia welcomes the increased involvement of  women in peacekeeping operations, especially among  human rights and humanitarian personnel, military  observers and civilian police. In that connection, we  strongly encourage the practice of mainstreaming the  gender perspective into peacekeeping operations. At  the same time, we must increase our efforts to improve  the protection of women in armed conflict, parallel to  acknowledging and enhancing their contribution to  peace processes and to rebuilding their communities.    The Commission for Gender Equality of the  Republic of Croatia - an intergovernmental  commission entrusted with creating policies and  coordinating all activities for the promotion of gender  equality - incorporated a chapter on women and  armed conflict in the national policy for the promotion  of gender equality for the period 2001-2005 and in its  implementation programme. Both documents were  adopted by the Croatian parliament in December 2001.    Some tangible results have already been achieved  in pursuing the goals set out in the national policy. One  such result was the inclusion of the study of  international humanitarian law and human rights in the    curriculum of the Croatian military academy as an  integral part of the military education of the armed  forces. Special emphasis is placed on the promotion  and protection of women's human rights and the  introduction of measures aimed at combating violence  against women in war, in armed conflict and during  post-conflict transition.    We seek to apply a gender perspective in  Croatia's participation in United Nations peacekeeping  operations. During 2005, two Croatian women officers  have been serving in the peacekeeping missions in  India and Pakistan and in Cyprus. Currently, five  women officers from the Croatian armed forces are  serving within the German contingent of the  International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.  Preparations are taking place for a female officer to  serve as a military psychologist in the peacekeeping  mission in Haiti. In addition, a captain of the Croatian  armed forces was the first female officer to take part in  the Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan.    Of course, the success of the application of the  principles and underlying themes of resolution 1325  (2000) rests with Member States. In that regard, there  is more that we all can do to ensure that women can  fully and equally participate at all levels of decision-  making with regard to conflict-prevention and  peacebuilding."

      "Text": "Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): We thank you,  Mr. President, for organizing this debate, and we thank  those who have offered briefings this morning. As a  delegation that has supported resolution 1325 (2000) in  its entirety since it was adopted, we agree that progress  towards achieving its major goals has been slow and  uneven. That is particularly true with regard to the low  number of women appointed as Special Envoys and the  continuing underrepresentation of women in formal  peace processes and in peacekeeping missions. Your  concept paper, Mr. President, and the report of the  Secretary-General make it clear that we must  considerably strengthen our efforts in that respect. We  hope that the input provided during this debate will  finally, eight years after the adoption of the resolution,  lead to significant improvements.    Appointing more women to leading positions  would have a catalytic effect and truly empower  women affected by armed conflict. It would strengthen  the perception that women are stakeholders 4 as  opposed to mere victims or aid recipients. A few years  ago, our then Permanent Representative in New York,  Ambassador Fritsche, headed a group of like-minded  ambassadors that tried to work towards an increase in  the number of women in such positions. The group met  regularly to exchange views and met with the  Secretary-General for joint lobbying efforts. It was  later taken over by the United Kingdom representative,  Sir Jeremy Greenstock, but their effort was thereafter  discontinued.    Several years later, it is sad to note that almost no  progress has been made. Despite repeated expressions  of good intent from all sides, a single woman currently  serves as Special Representative of the Secretary-  General, and women account for 28 per cent of higher-  category civilian staff in the Department of  Peacekeeping Operations. We therefore fully support  and reiterate today the call addressed to the Secretary-  General by the Women's Leaders Working Group to  establish, as a matter of high priority, a mechanism to  increase the number of women in such positions as  United Nations Special Representatives and Envoys, as  well as heads of peace operations.    Existing programmes to increase the leadership  and peacemaking capacities of women must be further  expanded. We also believe that the creation of a gender  unit within the Department of Peacekeeping Operations  would contribute to that goal. With the adoption this  year of Presidential No. Statement 36, the Security  Council noted that women have an important role to  play in mediation and the settlement of disputes. In  particular at the grass-roots level, their role can be  significantly more important than that of men. The  Council must therefore institutionalize women's equal  and substantive participation at all levels of peace  processes and create mechanisms to monitor their  equal participation systematically.  There is a clear link between an increase in  women's participation in peacekeeping missions and  the potentially lower level of sexual violence in  conflict and post-conflict situations. Since girls and  women in affected regions often associate uniformed  personnel with sexual violence, a higher number of  women participating in peacekeeping and police forces  will dramatically enhance the access of victims to  social and psychological services, including trauma  counselling and information-sharing on sexual  harassment, abuse and rape.    Most importantly, of course, those who are  supposed to provide protection must not, under any  circumstances, themselves become perpetrators. All  acts of sexual violence committed by peacekeeping  personnel, including sexual exploitation and child  prostitution, are unacceptable. They heavily undermine  the credibility and effectiveness of any peace  operation, but also of the Organization as a whole.  Zero tolerance can therefore be the only policy in that  respect.    The ultimate goal must be that the attitude and  behaviour of peacekeepers towards women can serve  as a model for local communities. Furthermore, the  mandates of peacekeeping missions must provide clear  guidance, especially for commanders, on how to  protect civilians, in particular girls and women, from  sexual violence. Predeployment and on-mission  30  training programmes must instruct police, security and  humanitarian personnel on how to recognize and react  to incidents of sexual violence.    Sexual violence is one of the most important  aspects of resolution 1325 (2000). While it has always  been part of armed conflicts, its systematic and  targeted use in numerous situations today is not just a  by-product of hostilities, or even just a war crime as  recognized in the Rome Statute. It often is a method of  warfare that aims to destroy the social fabric of  communities in order to achieve political and military  ends. It is against that background that we  co-sponsored resolution 1820 (2008) on the protection  of civilians from all forms of sexual violence.    We also welcome the adoption of presidential  statement 2008/28 on children in armed conflict,  referring to resolution 1820 (2008), and repeat our call  for targeted sanctions against perpetrators of acts of  sexual violence."

      "Text": "Mr. Beyani: I would like to thank the Permanent  Mission of Argentina and the other members of the  Security Council for holding this open debate on  the critical issue of displaced women and girls in  the framework of the women and peace and security  agenda. The intersection of peace and security, human  rights and development is critical to dealing with the  issue of internal displacement. We must not lose sight  of the important role that internally displaced women  can play in negotiating peace, ensuring their human  rights and bringing about development in post-conflict  situations.    As part of my mandate, I enter into dialogue with  Governments and the international community alike to  advise on and advocate for the best possible protection  of internally displaced persons (IDPs), and in all my  field missions I pay specific attention to the protection  of internally displaced women and girls. This year  alone, I have carried out missions to Kenya, Azerbaijan,  Cote d'Ivoire, Haiti and Ukraine. Such field missions  are significant in that they provide an early warning  system for the international community through the  Human Rights Council, the General Assembly and, in  this instance, the Security Council itself on the actual  causes, conditions and situations of displacement.    My mandate receives specific support from  United Nations agencies and entities, in particular  the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner  for Human Rights, the Office of the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees and the Office for  the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and I am  grateful for their support and great collaboration. My  work could not be possible without the outstanding  support extended by Member States, both those  working to cope with and to protect IDPs and those  supporting action to improve the lives of internally  displaced persons internationally. I am grateful for  the ever-growing cooperation extended by States to  my mandate. I would also like to highlight the Arria  Formula meeting in May on the protection of IDPs,  co-chaired by Chile and Argentina, which I had the  privilege to address and during which the issue of  internal displacement and threats to international peace  and security were tackled.    We started 2014 with an unprecedented peak in the  number of persons forcibly displaced within their own  countries due to armed conflict, generalized Violence  or human rights violations - 33.3 million internally  displaced persons, the highest figure ever recorded.  In many countries, IDPs are also displaced by natural  disasters, further compounding existing vulnerabilities.  Women and girls account for some half of the world's  IDP population.    Since the 1990s, greater attention has been paid to  the rights and needs of women and girls in emergency  and post-conflict situations and to promoting gender-  sensitive approaches in humanitarian, development  and early recovery response. A wide range of  resolutions - for instance, the landmark resolution  1325 (2000) - but also policies, gender-mainstreaming  efforts and targeted programmes have been adopted in  this regard, and they have increasingly encompassed  internally displaced women and girls.    The 1998 Guiding Principles on Internal  Displacement, which detail the specific rights of  internally displaced women and girls, have been  recognized by the General Assembly and in Security  Council resolutions. The Guiding Principles have  informed the inclusion of concrete and progressive  provisions on internally displaced women in subsequent  instruments, such as the 2006 Pact on Security,  Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region  and the 2009 African Union Kampala Convention for  the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced  Persons in Africa. In 2013, I dedicated my thematic  report to the Human Rights Council to the situation  of internally displaced women, and during this debate  I would like to draw to the attention of the Security  Council to that report.    Despite such positive developments, responses to  internal displacement still do not adequately address  the specific concerns and roles of women and girls.  During situations of conflict and violence, women and  girls flee to escape arbitrary killings, rape, torture,  inhumane or degrading treatment or starvation.  They may have been the victims of such violations  themselves or seen their loved ones attacked and  abused. The experience of my mandate is that women  and girls are targeted as a means of armed conflict - to  destroy and humiliate communities, to manipulate the  demographic composition of communities, for sexual  slavery including enforced concubinage, and at times  enforced sterilization. As IDPs, women experience the  various human rights challenges that are characteristic  to displacement situations and that often place IDPs  at greater risk than other affected populations. Such  challenges include the loss of livelihoods and key  documentation, as well as the lack of effective access  to a number of important rights and services.    In addition, internally displaced women often  face double discrimination, based on being both  an IDP and a woman, and experience human rights  challenges due to the intersection of gender with other  factors such as age, group affiliation such as minority  status, disability and civil or socioeconomic situations.  Displaced women often have to assume new gender  roles that further expose them to gender-based violence,  including physical violence and trafficking. Those  roles include being the only breadwinners and taking  on the increased burden of care for extended families.  Internally displaced women risk their lives, safety  and physical integrity to protect their husbands and  families. They have told me, \"If we let their husbands  and male children fetch firewood, food or water, they  will be killed, whereas we may be raped but spared  death\".    Other specific protection concerns for internally  displaced women include inequitable access to  assistance and psychosocial support, education,  training and livelihoods; poor reproductive health care;  and exclusion from decision-making processes. The  fact that more IDPs tend to live in urban rather than  camp or rural settings also raises additional challenges  that have detrimental impacts on women and girls. I  first visited cote d'Ivoire a year after the end of the  post-electoral violence. Many IDPs had found refuge in  urban areas, including girls who had been impregnated  during displacement and could not go back to their  communities as a result. However, the inability of  IDPs to continue renting their shelters in those urban  centres, once the cash grant they received to enable  them to stay in urban areas ran out. pushed the most  vulnerable communities, including women and girls, to  the outskirts of the city. Many displaced women and  girls, particularly those belonging to minorities, are at  risk of statelessness.    Pre-existing patterns of discrimination in many  of those contexts are exacerbated during conflict and  contribute to violations of women's rights to housing,  land and property. For instance, during my visit to Sri  Lanka, I was struck by the fact that many IDP women  either lacked proper documentation to their land or had  documents in the name of their deceased husbands or  fathers, preventing them from accessing their land.    To respond to those intricate problems with far-  reaching consequences, we need to look at long-term  solutions. Displacement is not just a humanitarian issue,  but also an issue ofbuilding peace, and constitutes a long-  term development challenge with profound political,  economic, environmental and security implications.  If left unaddressed, protracted displacement generates  further marginalization, inequality, fragility and  vulnerability and erodes women's resilience.    Displacement can overwhelm the institutional  capacities of affected States, which are already dealing  with major conflicts or disasters. Many States have  neither policy frameworks or coordination systems in  place to respond to internal displacement, nor a set of  procedures to bring quick assistance to populations  made extremely vulnerable from one day to another as  they have lost livelihoods, social protection and have  gone through traumatic experiences. States also lack  comprehensive IDP registration systems by age and  gender.    More needs to be done ifwe are to respond adequately  to the specific protection concerns of IDP women. Data  collection disaggregated by sex, age, location and other  key indicators is critical for effective advocacy and the  development of programmes to respond to the specific  needs of IDP women at all stages of displacement,  irrespective of the cause of displacement. National and  international efforts to collect, update, analyse and  disseminate both quantitative and qualitative data on  IDPs, including those outside of camps, displacement-  affected communities and communities at risk of  displacement should be strengthened.    A more preventive approach to sexual and gender-  based violence in the context of internal displacement  is also essential. In that regard, gender-sensitive  training should be provided more systematically to  police and military forces, judiciary personnel and  social workers. A stronger focus on prevention is also  required within the households and communities of  the internally displaced, including engaging men and  boys in those prevention and protection efforts. States  should take all measures to combat impunity for sexual  and gender-based violence, including by investigating  and holding perpetrators accountable. Efforts to reduce  exposure to sexual violence also entails ensuring that  survivors have access to appropriate support, including  reproductive health care and psychosocial services.    Ensuring access to justice and accountability  mechanisms is key when addressing internal  displacement with a gender lens. In addition to  promoting access to criminal and civil justice systems  for IDP women, it is also essential to consider how their  concerns can be addressed through transitional justice  measures such as truth and reconciliation commissions  and reparations. Donor accountability for gender-  equality programming for IDPs is essential and entails  more effective integration of gender issues into donor  practices.    I was heartened by the resilience of IDP women  I met in Ukraine. Many of them were volunteering to  help other displaced persons. Meaningful participation  by IDP women and girls in the development,  implementation, monitoring and evaluation of laws,  policies, programmes and activities that affect their  lives at all stages of displacement is key in the response  to internal displacement. IDP women, as individuals,  have the right to make free and informed decisions  concerning the resolution of their displacement on the  basis of adequate and appropriately communicated  information, participate fully in building peace and  in planning and management of their return, local  integration or resettlement elsewhere. The participation  and leadership of IDP women in finding durable  solutions that address their very specific concerns is  critical.    I would like to thank again Argentina for the  opportunity to address the Security Council today."

      "Text": "Ms. Rossignol (France) (spoke in French): Allow  me to begin by thanking the Secretary-General,  Mr. Kevin Hyland, Mr. Yury Fedotov and Ms. Ilwad  Elman for their briefings.    France associates itself with the statement to be  delivered by the observer of the European Union.    The actions committed by Da'esh in the Middle  East and by Boko Haram in Africa are a dramatic  illustration of the links that exist today between  threats to international peace and security and human  trafficking. At the global level, trafficking in persons  and trafficking in drugs and counterfeit currency are  among the most profitable. Their annual profits are  estimated at $32 billion. It is one of the most extensive  forms of trafficking. Sexual exploitation, forced  labour, servitude, kidnapping for forced prostitution,  rape - the list of atrocities committed in armed  conflict is, unfortunately, long. Deriving profits from  human beings and considering them as merchandise,  the traffickers, as well as consumers and users and  the clients of sexual exploitation, clearly and brutally  violate their victims' human rights and further stoke  the causes of conflict.    The international community has invested heavily  in this problem since the beginning of this century,  but further efforts are needed in order to address the  scourge of human trafficking. I therefore welcome the  initiative of the United Kingdom during its presidency  of the Security Council and thank that country for  giving us this opportunity to have an exchange on this  very important subject.    For France, the issue oftrafficking in human beings  and slavery, especially that of women and children, is  of major importance. The statistics are, unfortunately,  well known, but we must constantly point them out:  80 per cent of the victims of trafficking are women  and children. The challenges are also well known:  the identification of victims is still in its infancy, and  organized mechanisms for fighting this scourge vary  greatly between countries. Despite progress since the  entry into force of the Palermo Protocol to Prevent,  Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially  Women and Children, still too few prosecutions have  been initiated in cases involving the crime of human  trafficking. The victims themselves do not always assert  their rights and very often are insufficiently protected.  In that context, international cooperation must be  stepped up so as to increase the geographic coverage  of the legislation providing effective protection against  networks and to improve international cooperation  aimed at dismantling those networks. Prevention,  protection and the fight against impunity are the three  priorities of French diplomacy in the fight against  trafficking in human beings.    Since human trafficking is now an integral part  of the strategy of certain terrorist groups and it fuels  transnational organized crime, the Security Council  has a special responsibility in combating this scourge.  The adoption of resolution 2331 (2016), last December,  at the initiative of Spain, was a major step forward  towards better addressing the link between trafficking  in human beings, sexual violence and terrorism. France  very much looks forward to the report to be prepared by  the Secretary-General by the end of the year.    We have in place a robust international legal  framework and appropriate tools, in particular the  United Nations Convention against Transnational  Organized Crime and its Protocols and the United  Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, which is doing  sterling work in this field.    On International Women's Rights Day, the President  of the French Republic also announced that France  would propose an additional protocol to the Convention  for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination  against Women. That protocol would address violence  against women in order to complement the existing  international framework. But we must ensure that  the obligations arising from that legal framework are  effectively implemented. Our words must now be  translated into action.    Rest assured, Mr. President, that France will  continue to play its full part in those efforts."

      "Text": "Mr. Diallo (Senegal) (spoke in French): I would  like to convey my delegation's sincere congratulations  for the convening of this important debate on women,  peace and security, which represents, Madam  President, the crowning moment of your remarkable  presidency of the Council for the month of October. I  would like to thank the Secretary-General for his  statement, as well as Mr. Lazarous Kapambwe,  President of the Economic and Social Council,  Ms. Michelle Bachelet, Executive Director of  UN-Women, and Ms. Orzala Ashraf Nemat,  representative of civil society, for their important  contributions.    My delegation has a special interest in the topic,  because resolution 1325 (2000) represented an  enormous step forward in the protection of women and  highlighted the importance of their role in all aspects  of United Nations peacekeeping. Nonetheless, while it  has remained far from being a cure-all, resolution 1325  (2000) has contributed, along with resolutions 1820  (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1889 (2009), to improving the  normative framework for preventing gender-based  violence and for protecting women against that  scourge.    It should, however, be pointed out that, despite  those praiseworthy efforts, persistent shortcomings  have exposed thousands of women and girls to various  types of barbaric abuse and atrocities. In fact, rape  continues to be used as a weapon of war in certain  conflict areas, and the ongoing existence of sexual and  gender-based violence, even at the end of a conflict,  represents an almost permanent threat to the security  and health of that vulnerable group of the population.  That is why the international community must firmly  commit to vigorously combating impunity in order to  guarantee the effective prevention of all forms of  violence against women.    While welcoming the zero tolerance policy on  sexual violence of the Secretary-General, we must, in  addition, insist on the need to bolster the role of  women in conflict-prevention and resolution.  Nevertheless, the poor results in that area have  undoubtedly been due to the continuing low  participation of women in the drafting of  implementation strategies. I consider it crucial,  therefore, to foster women's participation by reserving  a key role for them in conflict-prevention policies, as  well as policies on peacekeeping, peacebuilding and  social and economic recovery. In that context, there  must be a special focus on women's empowerment,  which will require significant investment in education,  training and maternal health.    In View of our considerable awareness of that  dynamic process, my country has allocated a  significant part of its budget to education and health,  and on 14 May 2010, it adopted a law to establish full  parity in all partially or fully elected bodies. In that  manner, Senegal intends to ensure the effective  participation of women in decision-making processes.  To follow up on that law, a national gender-parity  monitoring body was set up and will be officially  inaugurated on 16 November.    Senegal has already adopted its national action  plan to implement resolution 1325 (2000).  Furthermore, it has sought to make a positive  contribution to drafting the action plan of the  Economic Community of West African States  (ECOWAS) and the Dakar Declaration by focusing on  the four following areas: first, effective participation of  women in the peace process; secondly, protection of  women and girls; thirdly, prevention of gender-based  violence through preventive diplomacy and early  warning systems, and fourthly, reconstruction and  victim assistance.  It is certain that those significant national and  regional level initiatives are welcome. However, they  will achieve the desired success only if linked with an  international dynamic inspired by the Security Council  and based on coordinated efforts on the part of  UN-Women and all of the other relevant bodies. There  is also a need to improve women's involvement in  peacekeeping operations by following up on the  laudable efforts already carried out in that domain.    The effective prevention of sexual violence also  requires stringent measures to vigorously combat the  root causes of conflict exacerbation. Since there is an  established link between what is known as low-level  conflicts and wide-scale violence against women, I  would like to launch an appeal for coordinated and  focused action against the illicit trade in small arms  and light weapons. In that regard, my delegation  cherishes the hope that the diplomatic conference of  2012 will enable the adoption of a robust arms trade  treaty.    Allow me to conclude by expressing my  country's conviction that the efforts to be undertaken  by 2015 will enable the Security Council to take stock  at that time of the positive implementation of  resolution 1325 (2000)."

      "Text": "Mr. Faqiri (Afghanistan): I thank you, Madam  President, for convening today's debate, which offers  us all an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to  protecting and ensuring women's rights and their  momentous role in peace and security. I also take the  opportunity to thank the Secretary-General for his  report (S/2011/598*) and his strong words of support.  And I thank Ms. Michelle Bachelet, Under-Secretary-  General for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of  Women, for her work and for her statement.    The history of war and violence has left a  disconcerting impact on my country. Violence still  takes its toll on every Afghan's life. I hope that the  anguish facing every Afghan family will one day come  to an end. Women continue to bear the bulk of the  burden of conflict in Afghanistan, while their right to  secure, healthy and prosperous lives is still in peril.  We meet today to recognize the crucial role of  women in the peaceful resolution of conflicts, the  tangible fruits of which have already been seen in  Afghanistan in the decisive presence of women at the  Consultative Peace Jirga in 2010 and in the continuing  efforts to ensure women's participation in leadership  positions within and outside of the Afghan  Government. The debate is particularly appropriate as  Afghanistan is entering the second phase of transition  to Afghan leadership and ownership and increased  responsibility for security and economic development.    With regard to development, we have begun to  implement our 10-year national action plan for the  women of Afghanistan based upon the priorities of the  Afghanistan National Development Strategy. As part of  the action plan, we have established gender units in  14 of the 25 Government ministries. However, given  the 10-year timeline, accelerated efforts are necessary  to ensure the full implementation of that very  comprehensive action plan, which incorporates vital  goals that include achieving a 30 per cent rate of  representation of women in governmental positions by  the end of 2013 and their 35 per cent participation rate  among university students by the end of 2012.    We have also made strides in ensuring the rule of  law, most recently the establishment of a national  commission on the elimination of violence against  women, following the enactment of the law in that  regard in December 2010. Those steps have been vital  in enhancing Afghan women's access to legal redress  and have also sent a strong message that the  Afghanistan Government is committed to the rights of  women and to ensuring that there is no impunity for  those who violate them.    Ensuring the rights of women is only half of the  battle; we also need to see the full participation of  women, as resolution 1325 (2000) reminds us that they  have a vital role to play in peace and security. The  representation of women in governance and their  political participation has steadily increased. We have  succeeded in holding two presidential and two  parliamentary elections, in which women actively  participated as candidates, elections staff, poll monitors  and electorates.    Women comprise 25 per cent of the Parliament,  thus ranking Afghanistan thirtieth among the countries  of the world with the highest rate of women  representatives in Parliament. The Afghanistan  National Parliament has also established a resource  centre for women parliamentarians to enhance their  capacity to effectively include women's voices and  perspectives in national development and  reconstruction plans.    When reviewing these facts and figures, let us not  lose sight of the great personal risk that these women  undertake in order to participate in the governance of  their country and in their future. I wish to take this  opportunity to honour the women who continue take  risks in order to assume an active role in the future  direction, peace and security of our country.    Our international partners have assisted the  Afghan Government in our endeavours. UN-Women  has administered a multi-donor trust fund for the  elimination of violence against women that provided  grants for national organizations to combat violence  against women. I am very pleased to report that, in  collaboration with UN-Women, Afghanistan has  submitted its first country report on the Convention on  the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against  Women. The continued collaboration of our  Government, international partners and both Afghan  and international civil society groups will be vital to  ensure the full realization of women's rights in a strong  and stable Afghanistan.    Building a stable and secure environment that  enables women to live free of intimidation and  violence and promotes their participation and  leadership in efforts to maintain peace and security is  one of the core objectives of the Afghan Government.    We are also focusing on women political actors at  national, subnational and local levels, as well as on  capacity-building and advocacy strategies to enable  them to obtain critical roles in high-level decision-  making processes, policy and law-making positions in  key Government institutions and to assist them in  carrying out their significant political and social  responsibilities.    In conclusion, with the support of our partners  and the international community, we will continue to  work towards the full implementation of resolution  1325 (2000), while recognizing that our goal of  sustainable peace and security in Afghanistan will not  be achieved without the full participation of the entire  Afghan nation."

      "Text": "Mr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I would like very briefly to respond to the  statement made by the representative of Ukraine.    Such attempts yet again to place all of the blame  for what takes place in that country onto the Russian  Federation come as a surprise to no one. Even the  reports regarding the shelling by the Ukrainian army  of residential areas, in violation of international  humanitarian law - reports coming from a variety  of sources, which cannot in any way be regarded as  Russian propaganda - provoke no response from Kyiv  other than yet further accusations against the Russian  Federation. Quite clearly, our Lithuanian colleagues  also take a selective attitude to such sources as well.    The reality is that on 13 April 2014, our delegation  initiated the convening of an emergency meeting of the  Security Council (see S/PV.7154) in order to attempt  to prevent the Ukrainian authorities from using armed  force in south-eastern Ukraine. We were unable to do  so. The so-called anti-terrorist operation was launched,  claiming civilian victims in its very first week. We  have called again and again for an end to the violence  and for the initiation of a full-fledged national dialogue  that would avert further civilian casualties in Ukraine.  Such an appeal was made to the authorities in Kyiv  as recently as today by the Russian Foreign Ministry.  Unfortunately, those calls have gone unheeded to date.    In conclusion, I recall that the topic of today's  meeting is the protection of civilians. Nadiya Savchenko,  a Ukrainian military officer, is not a civilian. However,  the Russian journalists were definitely civilians, and  she is accused of helping to kill them."

      "Text": "Mrs. Viotti (Brazil): I thank you, Mr. President,  for organizing this briefing. We welcome Special  Representative Margot Wallstrom and Assistant  Secretary-General Rachel Mayanja, and thank them  greatly for their important presentations.    In almost 10 years since the adoption of  resolution 1325 (2000), the international community  has come a long way. We have come to understand  more fully the implications of armed conflict for  women and have also become more aware of their  specific needs and roles in maintaining or restoring  peace and security. Through resolution 1820 (2008),  we have recognized the gravity of sexual violence in  armed conflicts and have enhanced our action against  it.    Resolution 1325 (2000) deals with women as  agents of peace. Such a role comprises many facets,  ranging from conflict prevention to post-conflict  peacebuilding. I would like to briefly touch upon two  such facets.    The first regards institutions. In post-conflict  scenarios, where institutions are rebuilt and gradually  consolidated, there is often a window of opportunity to  surmount historical gender inequalities or  insensitivities. It is precisely when the distribution of  power and roles within a society is being redrawn after  the trauma of war that efforts must be made to ensure  that the concerns and needs of women are duly  contemplated. That is especially applicable to such  processes as constitutional, political and educational  reforms.    The second aspect that I wish to stress relates to  the economic empowerment of women in post-conflict  situations, which is as important as institutional  empowerment. The participation of women in efforts to  rehabilitate and reactivate the economy is of particular  relevance. Given the fundamental role played by  women in key economic sectors, particularly in  agriculture, the impact of development projects can be  enhanced if such projects are focused on women.    Resolutions 1888 (2009) and 1889 (2009) took us  further in our endeavours regarding women, peace and  security, as they helped us to translate a wider  awareness of challenges and opportunities into  effective action. Among the decisions taken by the  Security Council in those resolutions, two are  particularly relevant due to their potential implications  in the mid- and long terms. The first is the request to  the Secretary-General to submit a set of indicators to  track the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  The development of indicators is meant to allow for  more rigorous and results-oriented interventions.    We appreciate the hard work that has gone into  the report before us today. We look forward to the  consultative process that will follow and give all  stakeholders the opportunity to contribute to the further  development of the proposed indicators. In that effort,  we should consider the importance of focusing on  qualitative rather than quantitative ways of measuring  progress and of ensuring flexibility as challenges  facing each country are different and should be  recognized and treated as such. It would be important  to guard against putting additional reporting burdens  on developing States, especially those emerging from  conflict. Collecting and aggregating data and preparing  reports can be challenging tasks. Instead of being a  mechanism for academic analysis, the indicators must  support countries in their practical efforts to improve  the situation of women in post-conflict situations.    The second important decision of the Security  Council in 2009 regarding women, peace and security  was the establishment of the post of Special  Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual  Violence in Conflict. It provides the United Nations  system with an authoritative voice empowered to  provide coherent and strategic leadership in the fight  against sexual violence in conflict. It fills a void in  helping different parts of the system to work more  closely and effectively together.    We welcome Ms. Wallstrom's appointment to the  position. We support her two forward-looking  recommendations of continuous attention and of  making prevention a top priority. We also support her  five-point agenda, as it proposes a balanced set of  measures focused both on the past and on the future, on  accountability and on cooperation, on the perpetrators  and on command responsibilities, and adds the very  welcome focus on peer liability.    We commend Mrs. Wallstrom's initiative to visit  the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We encourage  and support increased efforts at cooperation with the  Congolese Government in addressing capacity-building  and other needs in the fight against sexual violence. We  also appreciate the measures that have been taken by  the United Nations Organization Mission in the  Democratic Republic of the Congo to improve  women's security on the ground.    In concluding, let me also thank the Japanese  delegation for preparing the draft presidential  statement before us, which we fully support."

      "Text": "The Secretary-General: The women and peace  and security agenda is clearly one of the top priorities  of the United Nations as a whole. We see that in the  adoption of a great many resolutions by the Security  Council, including landmark resolution 1325 (2000)  and its many follow-up decisions. We see it in the global  recognition of the central role that women must play in  preventing and resolving conflicts. And we see it when  we gather to discuss the issue. That is always when the  Chamber is at its fullest and the list of speakers is the  longest. We have exactly that same situation today.    Given such strong support and common  understanding, an observer might be forgiven for  thinking that things are substantially improving. But  the sad fact is - and we must be blunt about it - that  the commitment that is always reflected around this  table is not translating into real change around the  world. It is not coming fast enough or far enough.  Change is coming at a pace that is too slow for the  women and girls whose lives depend on it, and for the  effectiveness of our efforts to maintain international  peace and security.    Nearly two decades after resolution 1325 (2000)  was adopted, women still face exclusion from many  peace and political processes. Peace agreements are  adopted without provisions that consider the needs and  priorities of women and girls. A pitifully small 0.2 per  cent of bilateral aid to fragile and conflict-affected  situations goes to women's organizations. The number  of attacks against women human rights defenders,  humanitarians and peacebuilders continues to increase.  Sexual and gender-based violence continues to be  used as a weapon of war, with the survivors of such  violence often left without justice or support. This year  alone, millions of women and girls were in need of  life-saving sexual and reproductive health services, and  millions more required interventions to prevent sexual  and gender-based violence. There is also a growing  number of armed groups for which gender inequality  is a strategic objective, and misogyny part of their core  ideology. And, of course, we know that women and  girls continue to suffer the consequences of conflict in  general. To cite just one example, in north-east Syria,  we saw thousands of women and children fleeing the  latest violence. But despite this grim litany, we will not  give up. This, for me, is an absolute priority.    We can report at least some progress. In Yemen,  where women were absent from the formal rounds  of consultations, my Special Envoy established a  Yemeni women's technical advisory group to ensure  that the perspectives of Yemeni women are included.  In Guinea-Bissau, women played a direct role in  breaking the political impasse last year, supported  by the Peacebuilding Fund. They led unprecedented  mobilization for parity laws requiring a minimum of  36 per cent of women on the ballot, and they were key  to the success of the elections this year. There were  record numbers of women candidates and voters, and  the country achieved parity among ministerial posts. In  Syria, women make up approximately 30 per cent ofthe  new Constitutional Committee, including some from  the Women's Advisory Board that has been working for  peace all these years.    Within the United Nations itself, the Department of  Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and the Department  of Peace Operations are implementing a new and stronger  policy on women and peace and security. All heads of  special political missions and my Special Envoys have    been instructed to report regularly on their efforts to  promote women's direct participation throughout all  stages of peace processes, in ways that ensure they have  influence over the outcomes. An objective related to  women and peace and security has now been included  in all senior managers' compacts related to peace and  security mandates. In our peacekeeping operations, we  are working to end sexual exploitation and abuse and  increase women's participation. Incidents of sexual  exploitation and abuse have been reduced by half, and  we are finally moving the needle on the percentage of  women in the military and the police components of  our operations. I have appointed many more women as  heads and deputy heads of missions, and we are pursuing  emergency measures to achieve gender balance.    Women and peace and security is one of the  eight priority pillars of our Action for Peacekeeping  initiative, endorsed now by more than 150 countries. I  have also requested peacekeeping and special political  missions to improve their monitoring and reporting of  threats and violence against activists, including women  human rights defenders, and for that to be built into  early warning signs of escalating conflict or instability.  Without a gender analysis, we are operating on partial  information and are unable to anticipate and respond  effectively to early warnings.    Today we recognize both progress and how much  more we must do. When we fall short, women, girls  and all members of society suffer the consequences. A  failure to act on women's rights and the principles of  the women and peace and security agenda bring about  enormous costs. Let us work together to change the  narrative and improve, through implementation, the  situation on the ground."

      "Text": "Mr. Hilale (Morocco) (spoke in French): First of all,  my delegation would like to thank France for organizing  this open debate during its presidency of the Security  Council, on an issue that is of the utmost importance to  Morocco - women and peace and security.    The historic adoption of resolution 1325 (2000)  represented international recognition of the role  played by women in peace and security, not only as  victims but also as agents of change and essential  players in restoring, maintaining and consolidating  peace. Maintaining peace and security requires the  integration of the gender perspective into all peace  efforts, in accordance with the provisions of resolution  1325 (2000) and the other resolutions that followed in  that regard.    Women's participation in negotiation processes  increases the chances of settling conflicts and  sustaining peace. That finding was confirmed by a UN-  Women-led global study in 2015, which revealed that  the presence of women in peace negotiations promoted  the sustainability of peace agreements, and that 35 per  cent of agreements negotiated by women lasted more  than 15 years. That means that the presence ofwomen in  peace negotiations is a great help for the sustainability  ofpeace agreements.    On 7 September, 2016, Morocco organized an  international conference on the topic of women and  peace and security. It contributed to the international  debate on the role of women in peace processes and  the implementation of national plans of action to  promote collective action on implementing resolution  1325 (2000). It was an occasion to reaffirm the  international community's consensus on the need to  strengthen women's participation in negotiations and  agreements concerning the settlement of conflicts and  peacebuilding, as well as to renew the United Nations  commitment to the issue of the inclusion of women  and gender equality in all peacebuilding and conflict-  prevention strategies.    During the conference, debates focused on  three areas: the role of women in mediation and  conflict-prevention processes, the role of women in  deradicalization and the lessons learned and best  practices in the prevention of sexual violence in  conflict. At the conference, my country announced the  creation in Rabat of an independent regional centre, a  think-tank, dedicated to studying the role of women in  peacekeeping operations and their contribution to the  achievement of sustainable development. The centre  could serve as a space for reflection, a think-tank and  a source of independent thought regarding the role and  place of women in peacekeeping and peacebuilding  operations in conflict zones. It is in keeping with the  priorities ofthe Security Council in promoting women's  empowerment and gender equality in the establishment  of peace and international security, the dissemination  of the culture of peace, ensuring access to justice and  the protection of civil rights.    Women and girls have special needs in the post-  conflict period, such as health services, livelihood,  land rights and property rights and employment.  They must also participate in decision-making and  the development of national strategies for post-  conflict economic recovery. Unfortunately, women  are often underrepresented in the decision-making  process associated with economic recovery and public  governance in the post-conflict phase. They are  not included in formal decision-making structures,  including key economic sectors, such as infrastructure,  extractive industries and commercial agriculture.  To that end, the preparation of an approach based on  gender and development in a post-conflict context is  imperative in order to ensure that, from the beginning  of the reconstruction process, there is sustainable  and equitable development where both women and  men share resources, opportunities, decision-making  and power.    In that context, the Kingdom of Morocco takes  this opportunity to commend the work of UN-Women  to promote the implementation of the Security  Council resolutions on women and peace and security,  particularly with regard to economic recovery and  reconstruction through the three areas of intervention:  post-conflict planning, economic recovery and  governance restoration.    The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  has placed great emphasis on peace, including the  prevention of conflict and the elimination of its root  causes through Sustainable Development Goal 16,  which seeks to promote peaceful and inclusive societies  for sustainable development, provide access to justice  for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive  institutions at all levels.  The universal 2030 Agenda, which advocates a  cross-cutting incorporation of gender in all Sustainable  Development Goals, emphasizes the need to redouble  efforts to prevent conflict and help countries emerging  from conflict, while ensuring that women are involved  in peacekeeping and reconstruction. In that sense,  the Goals demonstrate that gender, peace, security  and development are interconnected, interrelated and  inseparable from one another."

      "Text": "Ms. Baeriswyl (Switzerland) (spoke in French):  Sexual violence is one of the most devastating  weapons of war. It wreaks intense destruction on the  bodies and souls of the victims. It disrupts families,  displaces communities and destroys entire societies'  basis for reconciliation. That is why Switzerland would  like to thank the delegation of the United Kingdom  for organizing this debate and for making conflict-  related sexual violence a priority for both the Security  Council and the Group of Eight. We would also like  to thank the Secretary-General and the other briefers  for their valuable contributions. We hope that today  we can together generate a strong political will that  can enable us to improve the implementation of the  existing Security Council instruments, strengthen  the mechanisms of national and international law and  increase assistance to the victims.    In an unprecedented partnership, civil society  organizations, the Council and the United Nations as a  whole have put in place a visionary framework based on  five resolutions on women and peace and security. That  framework not only asks us to fight sexual violence  effectively in times of conflict, it also commits us  to supporting women as active agents for change.  The United Nations has developed indicators; the  Security Council has created a mandate for a Special  Representative and made the decision to establish  the monitoring, analysis and reporting arrangements  mechanism. With our partners from Liechtenstein,  Switzerland has supported the NGO Working Group  on Women, Peace and Security, PeaceWomen and the  Global Network of Women Peacebuilders in making  available to Council members a bulletin of monthly  action points, a handbook and even an iPhone app, and  in ensuring close ties between policymaking levels in  New York and the realities on the ground. All these  instruments and resources should be utilized in order  to implement the framework based on resolution 1325  (2000) without further delay. We therefore gratefully  welcome today's resolution 2106 (2013), which will  support those efforts.    First and foremost, however, prevention is essential.  We must break the cycles of violence. All parties to a  conflict must make specific commitments to combat  sexual violence and hold perpetrators accountable. I  would also like to voice a particularly serious concern  about the fact that the risk of systematic sexual violence  often increases considerably after or around high-level  visits. It is therefore imperative to ensure careful follow-  up and to prevent acts of revenge by strengthening local  capacities.    In his latest report (S/2013/149) the Secretary-  General encourages Member States to include specific  training courses for their peacekeeping troops.  Nevertheless, our methods have not been sufficiently  successful in fighting these crimes. That scourge  continues to undermine the credibility of United  Nations peacekeeping missions - not to mention the  immense harm done to the individuals and communities  affected by the behaviour of those who were deployed  in the field to protect them and ensure peace. The zero-  tolerance policy must be urgently implemented, and  everyone must be resolutely committed to bringing  perpetrators to justice.    International humanitarian law prohibits rape  and other forms of sexual violence. Such crimes can  constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or  genocide. International tribunals, especially the  International Criminal Court, play a key role in  punishing and preventing such crimes. For that reason,  it is crucial that all States lend their full support to  those institutions, not forgetting that the fight against  impunity for perpetrators of sexual Violence must  primarily be carried out at the national level.    Let us never forget that the very raison d'etre of  the United Nations, as set out in its visionary Charter,  is the abolition of war and all related crimes. As John  Lennon sang,    (spoke in English)    \"You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only    a)    one .  (spoke in French)    All around the world, men and women, communities,  civil society organizations, United Nations staff  and representatives and country representatives are  working hard to prevent and abolish war. Switzerland  is steadfastly committed to joining in those efforts."

      "Text": "Mrs. Miturumbwe (spoke in French): I would  like to say how pleased I am to be here today to tell the  Security Council and the international community in  general about the concerns and expectations of the  women of Burundi in the context of the  implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).    I would also like to express my gratitude to the  United Nations system as a whole for its efforts to help  Burundian women throughout the reconciliation  process.    Burundi has just emerged from a war that lasted  more than 10 years and caused a great deal of harm in  both human and material terms. Very recently, in  September, the Government and the Forces nationales  de liberation-Parti pour la liberation du peuple hutu  (FNL-PALIPEHUTU) signed a ceasefire agreement.  Burundian men and women have welcomed that step  but remain convinced that sustained efforts must  2  continue with a view to overcoming the many  challenges of the peacebuilding period.    Burundian women, who have committed  themselves to the quest for peace since independence  in 1961, continue to work to mobilize and to heighten  awareness of the need for better representation  throughout the decision-making process so as to ensure  that their rights are an integral part of negotiations. The  right of succession, which would guarantee women the  right to land and thus provide for their economic  security, was among the important issues considered  during the Arusha process. Despite progress at the  national level, we have to admit that our Constitution  and the Electoral Code say nothing about the proper  level of representation at the grassroots level. In fact,  the national gender policy lacks resources to  implement the principles of equality at the national  level. Burundian women have been active since the  peace talks, and the details of those activities can be  found in the documents distributed to you. There have  been consultations among women at the national level  in the context of implementing resolution 1325 (2000),  and the recommendations of those consultations can be  summed up as follows.    Concerning good governance and democracy, it is  important to ensure constant dialogue between the  Government, the political parties and the media. In this  dialogue, general interest should take precedence over  individual interest. For good, transparent and inclusive  governance, it is important not only to ensure  cooperation and dialogue at all levels, down to the  local level, but also to include all social groups,  especially women. In this connection, it should be  noted that the principle of a 30-per-cent quota is  applied only for a limited portion of the population and  is not reflected at the grassroots level. Furthermore,  this quota should be 50 per cent.    We recommend that the international community  continue to lend its support to Burundi, so that the  capacity-building programme for good governance,  which includes transparency, proper management of  public affairs, democracy and respect for human rights,  might remain a priority. A joint committee made up of  members of organizations from civil society and  Government should be set up to ensure follow-up in  the management of all national resources, including  resources granted by international organizations. The  current quota of 30 per cent should, in fact, be raised to  50 per cent and be applied at the local level. Civil  06-58804  society should be considered an active partner in all  programmes and processes.    Concerning demobilization, disarmament,  reintegration and reinsertion (DDRR), we should note  that this process is slowly moving forward. Among the  important challenges facing Burundi, we should give  special attention to the following: circulation of  weapons among the population, which is a source of  insecurity and constant tension, particularly for  women; victims, namely, ex-combatants and persons  who have been repatriated or displaced, primarily  women, have not yet received restitution and resort to  community conflict and violence; the recently  established National Commission for Land and Other  Property, which was welcomed by women.  Unfortunately, its functioning and the implementation  of its recommendations require not only mobilization  of substantial resources but also know-how and  experience in that field. We firmly hope that the new  Peacebuilding Commission, established as part of  United Nations reform, will make support for the  National Commission Land and Other Property one of  its priorities. The lack of programmes to help so-called  political prisoners who have been released adds to the  problem of insecurity.    Failure of the DDRR programme would  compromise achievements we have made towards  peace and democracy. We recommend that the  international community continue to give its political,  technical and financial support to the Government of  Burundi, so that disarmament, reintegration and  reinsertion might become a reality on the ground. The  international community should support civil society in  Burundi in its efforts to mobilize and promote  awareness among the population about the dangers of  possession and circulation of weapons in the  community and to promote voluntary disarmament. A  similar programme could be carried out at the  subregional level.    Since the end of hostilities, poverty has continued  to increase in Burundi and is affecting, above all,  women, who cannot inherit land from their parents and  cannot gain title to their husband's land and property.  In addition to dependence, corruption and fraud are  exacerbating the status of women. Women have always  asked that this be given priority in negotiations.    We recommend that the United Nations not hold  women hostage to the political situation in Burundi and  06-58804    that women be enabled to have direct access to  financing that allows them to undertake and  consolidate the work that they have been doing at the  grassroots level. Funds allocated by the Peacebuilding  Commission should be used for that work. The  Commission should ensure follow-up to the  implementation of a corruption and fraud focal point  that would ensure equitable distribution of public  property. The focal point should also respect gender  parity.    As for human rights, it should be emphasized that  these challenges refer to basic aspects of human rights,  for which we would like to make several  recommendations in order to promote respect for those  rights. Legislation for gender equality and equity  should be adopted and applied. There should be an  independent national focal point for women's rights to  ensure implementation of commitments made by the  Government under national legislation and  international treaties ratified by Burundi. There should  be an end to impunity through the establishment of  machinery for transitional justice to deal with rape and  murder. That would require the reform and  modernization of the police and legal services, which  must be professional in spirit and directly accountable  to the people. A trust fund should be established to  which Member States would contribute for at least five  years to enable women who are victims of sexual  violence and other abuses to have recourse to justice.  There should be support for organizations helping  women, in particular United Nations Development  Fund for Women, with material, financial and human  resources adequate to reach additional beneficiaries."

      "Text": "Mr. Barros Melet (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): We  thank the delegation of France for convening this open  debate and we appreciate the statements made by the  briefers. We extend special greetings to the civil society  representative from our region.    Chile aligns itself with the statements delivered by  the representatives of Canada, on behalf of the Group of  Friends of Women, Peace and Security, and of Panama,  on behalf of the Human Security Network.    We welcome the report of the Secretary-General  (S/2017/861) and express our support for the initiatives  related to the voluntary compact to end sexual  exploitation and abuse, which Chile has signed, the  appointment of the victims' rights advocate, the Senior  Women Talent Pipeline initiative, and the strategy  for the equal participation of men and women in  the Organization.    Chile was a Latin American pioneer in developing  an action plan for the implementation of resolution  1325 (2000) in 2009, under the administration of  President Bachelet, conscious of the important role  played by women as agents of change and forgers of  peace. The second national action plan is now in full  implementation, with a strong emphasis on education  and staff training.    The new plan includes the recommendations of  the Security Council and international best practices  in that area, making strides in creating indicators to  measure progress on specific objectives that facilitate  and promote women's access within peace operations at  all levels of action and decision. We have incorporated  a gender perspective in doctrine, planning and carrying  out of Chile's peace operations in all four thematic  areas and goals established by the United Nations:  prevention, participation, protection and relief, and  recovery. Chile co-sponsored resolution 2242 (2015),  promoted by Spain, and is a founding member of the  Women, Peace and Security National Focal Points  Network. The Network's last meeting in September  reaffirmed its commitment to continuing to support  and develop women's participation in decision-making  in all areas.    Equal opportunity and the empowerment of women  has been a key pillar of our Government's gender  agenda, which has made solid progress such as the  incorporation of gender equality in electoral reform,  and which requires that at least 40 per cent of candidates  running for Congress be women. At the international  level, we promote and protect women's rights in  armed conflict, especially given the need to increase  women's participation in decision-making related to  international peace and security. That is how we bolster  women's presence in peace missions both in Haiti and  in Colombia's special political mission. In the field  of prevention, we are developing academic initiatives  based on the women and peace and security agenda,  incentivizing the inclusion of a gender perspective in  sustaining peace activities.    The inclusion of women in peace operations raises  awareness about women's and children's issues on  the ground in such operations, and their presence has  helped prevent sexual exploitation and abuse. In that  context, women both in peace operations and within  communities have played a central role in sustaining  peace and protecting women's rights. We echo the  sentiments of previous speakers in affirming that one  of the greatest challenges we face is increasing the  participation of women in peace operations and, in  particular, ensuring the presence of gender advisers in  such operations."

      "Text": "Mr. Zidar (Slovenia): I would like to thank  Uganda for the initiative to convene this important  open debate on women, peace and security. I also thank  the Secretary-General, Under-Secretary-General for  Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women  Bachelet and other distinguished guests for their  presentations today.    Slovenia fully aligns itself with the statements to  be delivered by the representative of the European  Union and by the representative of Costa Rica on  behalf of the Human Security Network.    Resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and  security acknowledged that women are not just victims  of armed conflict and that their equal and full  participation is of vital importance in conflict  prevention, peacekeeping, conflict resolution,  peacebuilding and post-conflict recovery.    In the past 10 years, many activities have been  carried out to strengthen the role of women during and  after conflict. However, this anniversary reminds us  that despite those efforts, much needs to be done in the  protection of women and in the promotion of the  participation of women at the decision-making level, in  conflict resolution and in peace processes.    Violence against women, especially sexual and  gender-based violence, persists in conflicts. Recent  events in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have  shown that women continue to be deliberate targets of  injustice and sexual violence in the conflict and its  aftermath.  In his report (S/2010/498), the Secretary-General  takes up United Nations activities in the  implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). The report  shows that a vast range of activities has been carried  out in the past 10 years. However, the fragmentation of  those activities demonstrates the need to streamline and  coordinate the action of all members of the  international community. Slovenia supports the  Secretary-General's recommendation to develop a  single comprehensive framework that consists of an  agreed set of goals, targets and indicators to guide the  implementation of the resolution in its second decade.    We are of the opinion that the issue of women,  peace and security needs to be addressed in a holistic  and comprehensive manner. We welcome the Security  Council's decision to take forward the set of indicators  developed by the Secretary-General to track the  implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) in situations  of armed conflict as well as post-conflict and other  situations. We hope that the indicators will now  become operational.    Slovenia also supports the recommendation to  establish a dedicated working group to review progress  in the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and to  make recommendations to the Security Council on how  to address gaps and challenges to accelerate progress in  the implementation of the resolution.    Stronger steps should be taken to address  accountability and to end impunity for perpetrators of  violations. The Security Council should impose  targeted and graduated measures against all parties to a  conflict responsible for grave violations of women's  rights, including sexual violence. Sexual violence  should be a priority element in all Council resolutions  mandating the sanctions committees.    We all have a responsibility to implement  resolution 1325 (2000). The development of national  action plans is a key means by which Member States  commit themselves to fulfilling that responsibility. I  would like to report that Slovenia is about to finalize  and adopt such an action plan. The goal is to  interconnect existing national and international  activities addressing a broader concept of women,  peace and security in order to translate them into  genuine political commitments, and thus accelerate the  implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and  contribute to the empowerment and protection of  women.    In Slovenia, gender equality is a priority not only  in the field of human rights and development  cooperation but also in security and defence policy.  Since 2008, much has been done to promote gender  equality in the security and defence sector. Those  activities range from awareness-raising and training to  the adoption and modification of legislation and other  measures, including codes of conduct. The recently  adopted strategy on the participation of the Republic of  Slovenia in international operations and missions  promotes equal opportunities with regard to such  efforts at all levels, irrespective of gender.    Lastly, let me take this opportunity to encourage  the Security Council to continue to address the issue of  women, peace and security and to seek the most  effective means to improve the situation of women in  armed conflict. With a comprehensive United Nations  approach and increased ownership by Member States  over their activities, the plight of women in situations  of armed conflict and its aftermath can be eliminated."

      "Text": "Mr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese):  I wish at the outset to thank you, Mr. President, for  initiating and organizing today's meeting. I thank the  Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his report on  the United Nations system-wide action plan  (S/2005/636). Our thanks go also to Under-Secretary-  General Jean-Marie Guehenno, Ms. Rachel Mayanja,  Ms. Noeleen Heyzer and other participants for their  presentations this morning.    In his report, the Secretary-General makes many  concrete recommendations for further implementation  by the United Nations system of resolution 1325  (2000). We welcome his recommendations and express  the hope that they can be effectively implemented.    This year marks both the fifth anniversary of the  adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)  and the tenth anniversary of the Fourth World  Conference on Women, held in Beijing. Those  anniversaries lend particular significance to this open  debate on the question of women and peace and  security.    Five years ago the Security Council adopted  resolution 1325 (2000), which focused the international  community's attention on the question of women and  armed conflict and which provided guidance for the  endeavour to promote gender equality, protect women's  rights and expand the role played by women. In the  five years since then - thanks to the efforts of the  Secretariat, the relevant peacekeeping operations, the  Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Gender  Issues and Advancement of Women, the United  Nations Development Fund for Women and Member  States - much has been achieved in implementation of  resolution 1325 (2000). The international community  now attaches greater importance to the role of women  in the settlement of armed conflicts, and the  Department of Peacekeeping Operations has mandated  that enhanced protection of women be a very important  component of the daily work of peacekeeping  operations. Both at Headquarters and in many  peacekeeping operations, gender advisers have been  appointed.    At the recent High-level Plenary Meeting of the  General Assembly, world leaders once again stressed  the important role of women in the prevention and  resolution of conflicts and in peacebuilding and  reaffirmed their commitment to the full and effective  implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).    Five years on, when we look back on the road we  have travelled and forward to the path ahead, we can  see that a great deal of work remains to be done in  attaining the goals defined in resolution 1325 (2000).    First, we must strive to eliminate the root causes  of armed conflict and strengthen our conflict  prevention and early warning systems in order to create  an environment favourable to protecting women from  the harm that is caused by war. In other words, we  must cure the disease by addressing its root causes.    Secondly, crimes of sexual assault must be  punished more harshly; violence against women must  be more seriously investigated and its perpetrators  must be brought to justice. United Nations  peacekeeping operations must continue to pursue a  zero-tolerance policy to ensure strict compliance with  rules and adherence to standards.    Thirdly, women should be encouraged to  participate in peace processes at all stages. In  particular, it is essential to ensure that they have  decision-making power so that the special needs and  the role of women will be reflected in conflict and  post-conflict processes. Women are both the primary  victims of armed conflicts of all kinds and  indispensable participants in the resolution of any  conflict. Their ardent yearning for peace enables them  to play a more important role in the promotion of peace  processes.    Fourthly, a summary should be prepared of  successful experiences in protecting women's rights,  with a view to sharing and actively replicating them.  Efforts should be made to enhance awareness of the  need to protect women's rights and to ensure that  words are translated into deeds.    Fifthly, work carried out on this issue by the  relevant bodies should be effectively coordinated. All  parties should be encouraged to take steps with the  strength born of collective action and to make every  effort to achieve the best possible outcome. Organs  such as the General Assembly and the Economic and  Social Council have been considering women's issues  for many years and have rich experience to offer. The  Security Council should coordinate its activities with  theirs.    Women have played an important - indeed,  irreplaceable - role in the formation of human  civilization and the promotion of social development.  Progress for women is progress for all of humankind.  A popular Chinese saying has it that women hold up  half of the sky. We hope that, through our common  efforts, mothers, wives and daughters will no longer  shed their tears at the horrors of war and that all our  sisters worldwide will lead happy and peaceful lives.  We believe that our world will then be a brighter and  more beautiful place."

      "Text": "Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): I would  like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for    joining us at this important meeting of the Security  Council. We would also like to welcome to the Council  Chamber Mr. Bedouma Alain Yoda, Minister for  Foreign Affairs of Burkina Faso, and Mr. Alain  Joyandet, Minister of State for Cooperation and  Francophonie of France.    I would like in particular to welcome you,  Madam Secretary of State, and to acknowledge your  personal commitment and leadership, which have  created renewed impetus for the issue of the protection  of women's rights and the prevention of all forms of  violence against women. My delegation would also  like to thank the delegation of the United States for  leading negotiations on resolution 1888 (2009), which  has just been adopted.    With the unanimous adoption of that resolution,  the Security Council has reaffirmed its commitment to  the protection of women in armed conflict. The  significant number of delegations that joined in  sponsoring this initiative shows that the international  community is resolved to ensure that women and  children no longer remain the principal victims of the  armed conflicts which, deplorably, are occurring in  many parts of the world.    Council members were able to see for ourselves  the gravity of the acts of sexual violence against  women and children in areas of armed conflict in the  course of our visit to a number of African countries last  May, in particular the Democratic Republic of the  Congo. On that occasion we witnessed the  consequences of these crimes for societies and their  negative impact on efforts to find solutions to crisis  situations and promote an effective process of national  reconciliation. For that reason we wish to reiterate, as  does resolution 1888 (2009), the primary obligation of  all parties to an armed conflict to respect and to  enforce at all times international humanitarian law,  which grants special protection to women and children.    My delegation believes that the establishment of  the post of Special Representative of the Secretary-  General on sexual violence in situations of armed  conflict will make it possible to improve the systematic  and comprehensive attention that the United Nations  pays in response to sexual violence in these situations.    This new mandate should work in a coordinated  manner with other United Nations mechanisms and  agencies in order to harness synergies and to prevent  duplication. In particular, there is a broad relationship    between the objectives of resolution 1888 (2009) and  resolution 1882 (2009), on children and armed conflict,  which was adopted by the Security Council last  August.    These common objectives must be duly explored  with a view to providing comprehensive protection for  all those who, due to their condition, suffer most from  the consequences of armed conflict, that is, women and  children. In the light of the aforementioned, we believe  that the Security Council must also pay close attention  to the ongoing negotiations on a composite gender  entity within the framework of the General Assembly  and decide to review the mandate of the Special  Representative in a reasonable period of time and in  the light of the results of the procedure outlined in  General Assembly resolution 63/311.    While more can be done at the international level  in order to prevent sexual violence in situations of  armed conflict, the eradication of sexual violence will  only be achieved if national capacities among those  States that are addressing situations of conflict are  improved with a view to bringing the perpetrators of  such crimes to justice.    Therefore, one of the most relevant aspects of the  resolution is the identification within the United  Nations of a multidisciplinary team of experts who,  when their assistance is required and with the consent  of the State concerned, can be deployed to the field in  order to work jointly with the Government and the  United Nations system to undertake projects for  technical cooperation to strengthen the rule of law,  prevent impunity and address victims' needs.    It is clear that currently we have strong tools for  preventing sexual violence in areas of conflict. The  true challenge that we face is making full use of this  array of instruments, if we truly wish to ensure that  more women and children do not fall victim to the  spiral of violence that is caused by armed conflict."

      "Text": "Mr. Kolga (Estonia): At the outset, allow me to  join others in expressing gratitude to the Secretary-  General, the Executive Director of UN Women,  the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the  representative of the Non-governmental Organization  Working Group on Women, Peace and Security for  their statements. I would also like to thank the Council  presidency for taking up the topic and organizing the  open debate today.    Estonia aligns itself with the statement of the  European Union delivered earlier. In addition, I would  like to make the following remarks.    Estonia is dedicated to protecting and promoting  human rights and fundamental freedoms, both  nationally and internationally. As a member of the  Human Rights Council, our particular focus is on the  rights of women and children, gender perspective in  conflict settlements and the fight against impunity.  Estonia firmly believes that the rule of law in conflict  and post-conflict situations must promote justice and  accountability in ways that further the rights of women,  including through legal and institutional reforms that  are gender sensitive. The equal right to decision-making  and participation, along with women's empowerment,  is crucial to ensure a functioning society and peace and  justice in the aftermath of conflicts.    Additionally, as stated in the Secretary-General's  report (S/2013/525), women's representation in the  justice sector plays a significant role in increasing the  reporting of crimes and enhancing public trust in the  rule of law institutions. The importance of prevention  must likewise be stressed. By enabling women to fully  participate in judicial systems, we can better tackle the  root causes of impunity for Violence against women.    Estonia welcomes the call by the Security Council  in today's resolution to Member States to comply  with their relevant obligations to end impunity and  to thoroughly investigate and prosecute persons  responsible for atrocity crimes. Estonia further agrees  with the Council that the fight against impunity for the  most serious crimes of international concern against  women and girls has been strengthened through the  work of the International Criminal Court (ICC),  the ad hoc and mixed tribunals, and the specialized  chambers in national tribunals. ICC prosecutions  will not, however, be sufficient to ensure complete  accountability. Therefore, it is essential that the gender  provisions of the Rome Statute are translated into  national prosecutions.    Justice for victims of atrocity crimes, however,  entails more thanjust punishing perpetrators. The Rome  Statute further empowers victims by its broad victim-  participation scheme and underlines its commitment to  victims by its reparations provisions. Likewise, the ICC  Trust Fund for Victims has been doing important work  to alleviate the suffering of Victims in the countries  where the Court is conducting investigations.    Estonia was honoured to join the Declaration  of Commitment to End Sexual Violence in Conflict  during the General Assembly's opening week. We were  also glad to see how much interest there was in the  topic of enhancing accountability for sexual violence  in conflict, discussed at a side event during that week  that focused on the role of the ICC and that was hosted  by the Estonian Mission to the United Nations. We  would like to commend the important work of the Team  of Experts on Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in  Conflict, and I am glad to note that Estonia has made  financial contributions to the activities of the Team.    Estonia would also like to take the opportunity  to emphasize that in addition to conflict-related  sexual violence, increased attention should be paid  to the full range of violations and serious crimes  experienced by women, including gendered impacts  of enforced disappearances, foreign occupation, mass  forced displacement, restrictions on humanitarian  aid, conflict-related trafficking and the destruction of  civilian infrastructure.    Let me also commend UN Women for their work  targeted at raising the number of national action plans  related to resolution 1325 (2000) or other relevant  planning instruments, as outlined in the recently  adopted UN Women Strategic Plan. Estonia developed  its national action plan in 2010 and has advised a number  of States on developing theirs. We would be ready to  cooperate in that regard with other States in the future.  We are looking forward to hearing the results of the  global study, and to the high-level review in 2015.    In conclusion, we are glad to note that Estonia was  among the sponsors of resolution 2106 (2013), which  strengthens the monitoring and prevention of sexual  violence in conflict, and we were happy to co-sponsor  resolution 2122 (2013), adopted today."

      "Text": "Mr. Gata Mavita wa Lufuta (Democratic Republic of the Congo) (spoke in French): First of all, I  would like to thank France for organizing this debate.  I also commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  and his Special Representative Zainab Bangura, as  well as all those who spoke before me, for their very  useful presentations.    Sexual violence in conflict situations is a scourge  from which my country, the Democratic Republic of  the Congo, has long suffered. For more than a decade,  my country has experienced especially bloody armed  conflicts in the eastern part of its territory. Those  conflicts, which have caused many human casualties,  are at the source ofthe practice ofusing rape as a weapon  of war. The lives of thousands of girls, women, boys  and men have thus been disrupted. The consequences  of the situation psychologically, economically and in  medical terms are enormous.    This debate affords us an opportunity to once again  touch on the efforts of my country's Government to  combat this situation. The restoration of peace in the  part of the country formerly occupied by rebel armed  groups has brought major change. Enormous progress  has been made both in the fight against sexual violence  and at the level of responding to the needs of victims.  In referring to my country, the report (S/2016/36l) of  the Secretary-General attests to that in mentioning  the appreciable 80 per cent decline in the number of  cases of sexual violence in conflict areas. Among other  things, my Government attributes those results to the  following elements: the appointment of a personal  representative of the President of the Republic in charge  of the fight against sexual violence and the recruitment  of children; the adoption of a plan of action to combat  sexual violence among the armed forces and the  signing ofajoint communique on the issue between the  Government and the United Nations; the adoption of a  zero-tolerance policy; and the signing by the Minister  of National Defence of a decree on the responsibility  of the unit commanders of the Forces armees de la  Republique democratique du Congo for combating  sexual violence.    All of those steps reflect the will of the Government  to end this scourge and honour its international  commitments. Against that backdrop, the Government  is committed to addressing the various problems,  including deliveringjustice in the fight against impunity.  In that connection, 111 cases were decided in 2015 by  the military justice system, without regard for the rank  ofthe accused. We have also established a compensation  fund, while two Senate committees, on sexual violence  and on political, administrative and judicial issues, are    working on a bill proposed by the office of the personal  representative of the Head of State. On preventing  sexual violence, a regional campaign called \"Breaking  the Silence\" will be launched by September. On  socioeconomic reintegration, with the collaboration of  our national institute for professional training, training  was organized at Kibumba last September in various  economic sectors for survivors and demobilized  fighters. That type of training will continue this year  in Rutshuru in North Kivu and in Bunia and Aru in  Ituri and will train 2,000 people. A $35,000 credit fund  was set up to meet the financial needs of some women  in Bunia. That progress has been made possible thanks  to the Government's own resources, with the technical  support of the international community, including  assistance from Japan via Ms. Bangura's office,  and the United Nations Population Fund and various  other partners.    In conclusion, my country is determined to continue  its efforts to completely eradicate sexual violence. We  highly value the support provided to us in that regard  by the United Nations and the international community."

      "Text": "Mr. Pedersen (Norway): I am delivering this  statement on behalf of Denmark, Finland, Iceland,  Sweden and my own country, Norway.    The persisting impunity for perpetrators of sexual  violence is intolerable. The numbing stigma must  be dealt with. When people flee to safety, we should  make it our priority to ensure that they are not exposed  to new abuse. The problem of sexual violence must  be addressed in ceasefire agreements. It must be on  the table in peace negotiations, part of our analysis  in humanitarian efforts and at the forefront in our  peacekeeping operations.    We must deal with inconsistencies. Rape is often  treated as a burden that the woman must bear by herself,  while a gun wound is a matter of national security. Yet  sexual violence undermines the societies that we are  striving to stabilize and rebuild. It destroys the future,  as well as the present, for many more than those directly  affected. That fact should serve to mobilize our whole  peace and security architecture. If we are serious about  sustaining peace, we must ensure that prevention is not  just a priority but the main priority. And when we have  been unable to prevent abuse, our approach must be  focused on those who have suffered the crime. We must  fight the stigma, investigate and prosecute.    Our response to conflict-related sexual violence  must be firm and all-encompassing. Impunity  is unacceptable, and perpetrators must be held  accountable. The International Criminal Court plays a  central role at the international level in the fight against  impunity, but the capacities of national authorities must  also be strengthened. States have a primary duty to  prevent, investigate and prosecute sexual violence.    We value the work of the United Nations Team  of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence  in Conflict and the unique capacity of Justice Rapid  Response, in cooperation with UN-Women, which  provide the needed expertise for investigating sexual  and gender-based violence. We support the Call to  Action on Protection from Gender-based Violence in  Emergencies, led by Sweden, and appreciate the work  of civil society, which remains key.    Also, United Nations peacekeeping operations  must have the capacity to prevent and respond to  conflict-related sexual violence and other human  rights violations in communities where they operate.  Female peacekeepers play an especially crucial role,  and increasing the number of women serving in peace  operations is therefore also vital from that perspective.  We deploy many women police and are striving  to increase the number of women in our military  contingents, because we want the best, irrespective of  gender. A diverse team delivers better. We train our  military and police personnel before deployment and  in-mission on sexual and gender-based violence, and  support the African Union and African countries in  their efforts in this area.    The Nordic Centre for Gender in Military  Operations is a resource, as is Sweden's handbook for  gender mainstreaming in operations. In cooperation  with key partners, Norway recently started to develop  a handbook for military staff in United Nations  operations on preventing and responding to sexual  violence in conflict. We thank the Secretary-General  for his leadership in working to ensure that the zero-  tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse  in United Nations peacekeeping operations, and we  hope it will become a reality. The Nordic network of  women mediators is evolving, and more such networks  are forming. We must draw on their experience  and competence.    The need for gender competence and inter-regional  exchange is growing as people are on the move  and facing new vulnerabilities as they seek new  opportunities. It should spur us all to act more  strategically and forcefully."

      "Text": "Mr. Matussek (Germany): Germany welcomes    this year's Security Council debate on women and    peace and security, marking the eighth anniversary of    resolution 1325 (2000). Germany associates itself with    the statement made by the French presidency of the    European Union and would like to add the following  remarks.    We welcome the particular emphasis of this  year's debate on the issue of women's equal  participation and full involvement in all efforts for the  maintenance and promotion of peace and security.  Resolution 1325 (2000) has given us a very clear  mandate in that regard. Unfortunately, as today's  debate and the report of the Secretary-General  (S/2008/622) have shown, many structural and  institutional impediments remain. We call upon the  United Nations system and upon ourselves, the  Member States, to step up our efforts leading to  concrete advancement in the equal inclusion of women  in peace talks, justice processes and peacekeeping.    Let me emphasize that Germany firmly believes  that the creation of a strong and effective United  Nations gender entity has to be part of those efforts.  We hope that the Secretariat will soon provide the  membership with the requested detailed paper on  modalities, so that substantive action can be taken  before the end of the current session of the General  Assembly.    Resolution 1325 (2000) and the Secretary-  General's report rightly emphasize the essential role of  training United Nations staff, peacekeeping personnel  and civil society as a means of ensuring the equal  participation of women. Let me therefore highlight  some best practices and some examples of how  Germany actively contributes to the effective  implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) in the field  of training.    The Centre for International Peace Operations  was established by the German Federal Government in  June 2002 with the aim of enhancing Germany's  civilian capacity for crisis prevention. The Centre's  core mandate is the training, recruitment and support of  German civilian personnel for peace operations and  election observation missions, conducted in particular  by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in  Europe, the European Union (EU) and the United  Nations. The Centre cooperates closely with  international and other European training centres, such    as the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training  Centre in Ghana, and is a founding member of the EU  Group on Training. Gender aspects, in particular the  role of women in conflict resolution, are consistently  taken into account in the design of training modules.  Overall, since 2002, a total of 416 women from  Germany and 129 women from abroad have  participated in the Centre's training courses. In 2007,  52 per cent of participants in such training courses  were women.    The German Government also funds a pilot  project called the Mobile Peace Academy OMNIBUS  1325. That \"bus line\" has since toured several  countries in the northern and southern Caucasus  regions. On each of its stops, it has conducted train-  the-trainer sessions with local non-governmental  organizations, public officials, teachers and journalists  on the relevance of resolution 1325 (2000) and on the  integration of a gender perspective into their work for  peace in the region. Just last week, the bus returned to  Berlin and was greeted with a high-profile press  conference.    The adoption in June this year of resolution 1820  (2008) on women and peace and security and sexual  violence in armed conflict was a landmark  achievement. It strengthened and further developed our  commitment to the protection of women in situations  of conflict and their active participation in the  promotion of peace and security. Resolution 1820  (2008) created many new obligations for the United  Nations, for the Security Council and for Member  States. Inter alia, the Secretariat was asked to submit a  comprehensive and operational report on the  implementation of resolution 1820 (2008) by June  2009.    I am pleased to announce today that Germany has  decided to provide the necessary funds for the  recruitment of an additional policy specialist in the  Peacekeeping Best Practices Section of the Department  of Peacekeeping Operations, whose task it will be to  oversee coordination of that report. In addition, he or  she will be tasked with designing a global strategy for  the implementation of resolution 1820 (2008) and with  developing and elaborating key training messages and  an outreach and partnership strategy, including with  troop- and police-contributing countries.    We are confident that Germany's financial  contribution will significantly facilitate the submission  of a report that will be substantive and operational and  will allow us to further develop the vision of resolution  1820 (2008). We take that contribution as proof that  Germany, as a friend of resolution 1325 (2000), is  deeply committed to the vision of both landmark  resolutions, 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008), and will  continue to undertake concrete efforts for their  implementation."

      "Text": "Mr. Skoog (Sweden): I would like to thank you,  Madam President, for your initiative in organizing  today's debate.    I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Nordic  countries of Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway  and my own country, Sweden.    First, I would like to thank the Special Representative  on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Ms. Zainab Hawa  Bangura, for her statement and for her activities and  hard work. I would also like to thank Ms. Hamsatu  Allamin for her participation in today's meeting.  The role and influence of civil society in preventing  conflict, building peace and promoting human rights is  essential and it should be supported.    We warmly welcome the report of the Secretary-  General (S/2015/203) and its concrete and specific  recommendations on actions, and we commend Special  Representative Bangura and her Office for their work in  this regard. I would also like to commend the Team of    Experts on Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict  in strengthening the capacities of States to address such  violence, but despite rising recognition and attention to  this issue, the picture is appalling. Nothing less than  zero tolerance is acceptable in this area.    The fight to prevent and eradicate conflict-related  sexual Violence must be pursued on several levels.  These crimes do not emerge in a vacuum; they take  place against a backdrop of structural, gender-based  discrimination. Sexual violence is a reflection of  gender inequalities. Therefore, a systematic and broad  gender approach, which includes increasing women's  empowerment through political participation and  influence, strengthening women's economic rights and  empowerment, promoting and protecting sexual and  reproductive health and rights, improving women's  and girls' security and furthering the education of  women and girls, needs to be applied. These issues are  fundamental.  I would like to raise three more points. First,  measures dealing with the consequences of sexual  violence need to be stepped up. Assistance to survivors  and witnesses, including sexual and reproductive health  services and psychosocial, legal and livelihood support,  is crucial, as was stressed by my Colombian colleague.  It is urgent that we take further concrete steps to ensure  accountability and end impunity, as many around this  table have said today. We welcome and support the  efforts of the Chief Prosecutor of the International  Criminal Court and the ongoing work of Justice Rapid  Response and UN-Women for enhancing the capacity  to investigate sexual and gender-based violent crimes  which deny women and girls their human rights.    Secondly, there is a growing recognition that men  should be involved to a larger extent in the work in  favour of gender equality, as it cannot be left to women  alone. There is a need to look at the impact of masculine  identities on gender inequality, conflict and Violence.  Evidence suggests that violent notions of masculinity  not only perpetuate gender-based violence but can also  fuel armed conflict, while more positive notions of  masculinity could be instrumental in promoting peace.    Thirdly, we note the rise of violent extremism and  terrorism, which are often built on perceptions that  deny women their enjoyment of human rights. More  attention on the human rights of women is therefore  needed, particularly in the context of terrorism and  counter-terrorism, especially with regard to the specific  consequences of violent extremism on women's and  girls' rights. Sexual violence and the denial of rights  and freedoms, including the right to control their  sexuality and reproduction, are integral to the ideology  of extremist groups and used as part of a strategy to  spread terror, persecute ethnic, religious and sexual  minorities, and suppress whole communities that  oppose these groups' ideology. It is clearly a tactic of  terror and needs to be addressed in the international  community's response. We therefore welcome the  recommendation that efforts to prevent and address  sexual violence and promote human rights of women  should be closely and strategically aligned with efforts  to prevent Violent extremism. Conflict-related sexual  violence should be a topic fully integrated into the work  of relevant Security Council sanctions committees.    Women protection advisers and gender advisers  have a central role to play in ensuring competence  and knowledge in order for United Nations missions  to meet actual needs in the field. A11 missions should  have a gender adviser with a sufficiently high level  of authority and who should work directly with the  mission leadership. Gender advisers, gender focal  points and women protection advisers should be funded  from the regular budget. Nevertheless, the ultimate  responsibility to secure the gender dimension naturally  lies with the leadership of the mission.    The Nordic countries are firm supporters, including  financially, of United Nations Action Against Sexual  Violence in Conflict. We believe that United Nations  Action makes the United Nations system work in a  more holistic and coordinated way.    Lastly, the important role of media and civil society,  including women's rights organizations, should not be  underestimated. We need to draw on their knowledge  and experience and recognize the pivotal role they play  in changing social norms, attitudes and behaviours and  help ensure that women's rights are upheld and that  their voices are fully heard."

      "Text": "Mr. Esono Mbengono (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in Spanish): At the outset, I would like to congratulate  South Africa on its successful presidency in October and  on the Council's adoption of resolution 2439 (2019), on  women and peace and security. We wish the delegation  of the United Kingdom a productive presidency and  would like to assure it of Equatorial Guinea's steadfast  collaboration and support. My thanks also go to the two  briefers, my sisters Deputy Secretary-General Amina  Mohammed and Ms. Fatima Kyari Mohammed, for  their informative statements.    We join others in commemorating the tenth  anniversary of the establishment of the mandate of the  Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary  General on Conflict-Related Sexual Violence. Our  Government will continue to support the various  elements of the United Nations architecture aimed  at combating sexual violence in armed conflicts, the  promotion of women's rights and the inclusion of  women in decision-making processes.    The Republic of Equatorial Guinea believes that the  enhanced cooperation between the Security Council  and the African Union's African Peace and Security  Architecture, which also strengthens subregional  initiatives in the implementation of Council resolutions  to advance the women and peace and security agenda,  among other things, is an example of the type of  alliance that should continue to be supported in a  more predictable manner. In that regard, we would  like to highlight the high-level visits led by the Deputy  Secretary-General to the Democratic Republic of  the Congo and Nigeria in 2017, the Niger, the Sahel,  South Sudan and Afghanistan in 2018, and to Ethiopia,  Djibouti, Somalia and Eritrea this year, not forgetting  the visit to Cameroon in April. I would also like to  acknowledge the dedication of the Office of the Special  Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual  Violence in Conflict to mainstreaming this agenda,  while also encouraging the strategic initiatives within  the Joint United Nations-African Union Framework for  Enhanced Partnership in Peace and Security concerning  the prevention of and response to conflict-related  sexual violence in Africa, bolstered by the support of  UN-Women, the African Women Leaders Network and  FemWise-Africa.    The strategic importance of the Horn of Africa and  the generally positive evolution of events in the region  made ajoint visit of the United Nations and the African  Union more than necessary. These visits are becoming  something of a tradition for the two institutions, which  complement one another in the quest for solutions to  issues affecting life on the African continent. Equatorial  Guinea has always applauded the cooperation between  the two organizations in Africa, given that their  partnership is a valid formula that is bound to have  positive results. The promotion of the women and peace  and security agenda must continue to be united in its  criteria and actions with a View to making more room  for women at the negotiating and decision-making  tables and benefiting from their unique perspective.  Only in this way, and with the support of subregional  institutions such as the Intergovernmental Authority on  Development, will it be possible to make progress in  terms of conflict resolution and peacebuilding in the  subregion and throughout the continent.    The participation of women in the quest for  solutions to the problems affecting the region should  be encouraged. Women, together with young people,  must be at the heart of those efforts in order to forge  sustainable peace and development and seek out  lasting solutions in a context of humanitarian crisis.  And women must always play a principal role in post-  conflict situations."

      "Text": "Mr. Juwayeyi (Malawi): Those of us who are not  in the Security Council do not get an opportunity to  congratulate a delegation for assuming the presidency  of the Council, so it gives me particular pleasure this  morning to congratulate you, Mr. President, and I am  most grateful that during your presidency you have  taken the initiative to hold this open session on women  and peace and security.    My Government attaches great importance to the  protection and security of women and girls, both in  situations of armed conflict and in peace. Wars and  armed conflict bring untold suffering and misery to  communities and nations, for they entail devastating  and horrific levels of violence and brutality, employing  any possible means. Today's wars and conflicts make  little distinction between soldiers and civilians and  between adults and children. Currently, most of the  wars and conflicts take place in developing countries,  where most of the population lives in rural areas.  Often, these conflicts are within countries, rather than  across borders. Women and children constitute a  disproportionate number of the affected populations  and, therefore, suffer the brunt of violence and  brutality.    Armed conflict affects women and girls  differently from men and boys. During armed conflict,  not only are women and girls killed, maimed, abducted,  separated from their loved ones, subjected to  starvation, malnutrition and forced displacement, but  they are also continually threatened with rape,  domestic violence, sexual exploitation and slavery,  trafficking, sexual humiliation and mutilation. Rape  and sexual violence perpetrated by the armed forces,  whether governmental or other actors, including in  some instances peacekeeping personnel, increases the  potential for spreading HIV/AIDS and other sexually  transmitted diseases. No wonder most of the  HIV/AIDS victims in the developing countries are  women and girls. HIV/AIDS leaves millions of  children orphaned and, in most cases, the responsibility  to care for them rests largely on the shoulders of older  people.    All of these harmful and widespread threats to  women and girls have long-term consequences for  durable peace, security and development. The sad thing  is that in most instances the women do not know why  the wars and armed conflicts erupt, owing to the fact  that they are either under-represented or not  represented at all at the decision-making levels.    My Government applauds and thanks the  Secretary-General, the United Nations bodies and  agencies, non-governmental organizations,  international agencies and donor countries for the  efforts they have made to protect and secure peace and  security for women and girls. Various international  legal instruments, particularly the Convention on the  Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against  Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and  the corresponding Optional Protocols, have been  adopted by the General Assembly. International  Criminal Tribunals have been established for the  former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda, and these have  made great strides to help end impunity for crimes  against women and girls. Forms of sexual violence are  now included as a war crime in the Rome Statute of the  International Criminal Court. Beyond its emergency  relief responsibilities, the United Nations has  increasingly become involved in efforts aimed at  peacekeeping, peace-making and peace-building. It is  gratifying to note that the Security Council, even  though it has taken five decades to do so, has now  recognized the importance of women's role and of their  increased participation in the prevention and resolution  of conflicts and in peace-building.    However, there is still a lot more that needs to be  done. Appropriate solutions cannot be achieved if  women are left out of the decision-making machinery.  You are aware, Mr. President, that women continue to  be under-represented in all peacekeeping, peace-  making and peace-building efforts, including in the  Department of Peacekeeping Operations in the United  Nations. This should not be allowed to continue.    In the long term however, the only way to truly  ensure the protection and security of women and girls  is to prevent wars and armed conflicts from taking  place. Major root causes of most of the recent wars and  armed conflicts have included poverty and lack of  respect for human rights. These ills must be addressed  first. My delegation recalls that, at the end of the  Millennium Summit, world leaders pledged to  eradicate poverty and make the right to development a  reality for everyone. This means promoting equality  between men and women in decision-making. This  further means the involvement and full participation of  women in all issues, including peacekeeping,  peacemaking and peace-building, as well as at the  negotiating table, from the grassroots level to the  decision-making levels.    My delegation requests the Secretary-General and  the Security Council to urge Member States to ensure  that training in human rights and peacekeeping,  peacemaking and peace-building includes everyone -  civilians, soldiers, the police, civil society, the women  themselves and peacekeeping personnel. Those who  commit crimes against women, including the  peacekeeping personnel, should be brought to book.    Let us heed the women's cry for an equal  opportunity to voice their ideas in official peace  negotiations. And let us act now."

      "Text": "Mr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): We  appreciate the initiative of the Plurinational State of  Bolivia in convening this timely open debate. Peru  is committed to the women and peace and security  agenda. Together with Sweden, we have the honour  of chairing the group of experts that promotes that  agenda in the Council. As such, we fully support  the statements of Minister Wallstrom of Sweden and  Minister Brandt of the Netherlands, who today honour  us with their presence. We would also like to commend  the important briefings of the Secretary-General, the  Executive Director of UN-Women and, on behalf of  women's organizations, Ms. Randa Siniora Atallah.    Peru emphasizes the importance of women's  participation and leadership in the maintenance of  international peace and security and, in relation to  that, the primary responsibility of national States in  promoting their political and economic empowerment.  Since 2000, the Council has adopted eight resolutions  that have served to set an agenda and develop good  practices in that area. Nevertheless, barriers and  challenges persist, forcing us to redouble our efforts  as we approach the commemoration in 2020 of the  twentieth anniversary of the historic resolution 1325  (2000).    The evidence shows that when women participate  more at every level of political life, societies are less  inclined to conflict and more inclined to maintain  and consolidate peace. Women bring perspectives  on future and unity that are essential to building and  sustaining peace. In that regard, we emphasize that  gender equality and women's economic and political  empowerment contribute to reducing their particular  vulnerabilities during conflict and in general to  preventing violence and advancing human resilience,  as well as achieving the Sustainable Development  Goals. An investment in women's empowerment is  an investment in peace and development as well as in  protecting and promoting their human rights. That is  why we want to highlight and support the Secretary-  General's vision and the priority he gives to developing  and implementing this agenda, based on the concept of  sustainable peace. With regard to the role of women in  the maintenance of international peace and security, we  underscore the Secretary-General's views on the need  to promote their participation and leadership in every  peace effort, starting with active collaboration with  women's civil-society organizations. In that regard,  we wan to emphasize the importance of contributing  to financing the women's organizations that have been  asked to participate in the peace processes launched by  the Council.    We also underscore the importance of incorporating  gender perspectives into peace operations mandated  by the Council. In our View it is crucial to train Blue  Helmets in promoting and protecting women's and  children's human rights. In that regard, and in view  of the provisions of resolution 1820 (2008), Peru has  been gradually increasing women's participation in the  armed forces we send to United Nations peacekeeping  operations, and we have already surpassed the minimum  15 per cent required in the resolution.    Still with regard to the agenda on women and peace  and security, our Ministry of Women and Vulnerable  Populations has created a displaced persons registry  that enables us to quickly recognize and address issues  relating to the rights of women and girls who were  affected during the years in which Peru was battling  terrorism. Our Government has also committed to  implementing policies aimed at empowering women  in the political and economic life of the country,  with a decentralized approach that includes the need  to guarantee the election of women to positions  of authority.    I would like to conclude by citing in this debate  the voice of Flora Tristan, a Peruvian citizen who was  one of the great nineteenth-century pioneers in the  vindication of the rights of women:    \"All of the world's misfortunes stem from the  oblivion and contempt in which the natural and  essential rights of being a woman have been held  until now\"."

      "Text": "Ms. Power (United States of America): On  behalf of the United States, I should like sincerely  to thank those countries that voted in favour of  resolution 2272 (2016), which was adopted today.  The resolution underscores the Security Council's  responsibility - our responsibility - to address the  scourge of sexual exploitation and abuse in United  Nations peacekeeping, which has been allowed to  persist for far too long. Impunity for such abuses clearly  undermines our efforts to promote international peace  and security. The resolution makes clear that it is our  job to ensure that there is accountability when men,  women and children are abused by the Blue Helmets  whom the Council has sent to protect them.    The resolution signals the Security Council's strong  support for the zero-tolerance policy of the United  Nations and for the ongoing efforts by the Secretary-  General to strengthen this institution's response,  reporting and remedial measures to prevent and combat  sexual exploitation and abuse among United Nations  peacekeepers. The resolution underscores the fact that  peacekeepers found guilty - not those accused, those  found guilty - of committing sexual exploitation  and abuse do not deserve to serve in United Nations  peacekeeping missions, and sends a clear message to  troop- and police-contributing countries that fail to  take action to prevent or punish credible allegations of  sexual abuse and exploitation, as well as to all States  Members of the United Nations and to United Nations  bodies, to ensure that these investigations are carried  out thoroughly, promptly and impartially.    I should also like to echo my French colleague's  comment that the colour of the helmet means little to  the victim. All of us, wherever we serve, whether we  wear a blue or a green or some other colour helmet,  have a responsibility to live up to the standards that  this resolution tries to enshrine. All of us have a  responsibility with respect to individuals who serve us  overseas, in the same way that we have a responsibility  within our own borders to ensure that these kinds of  crimes are never carried out and that when they are  carried out the perpetrators are held accountable.    The resolution adopted today endorses the decision  of the Secretary-General to repatriate United Nations  peacekeeping units that demonstrate widespread or  systemic sexual abuse and exploitation, and it requests  that the Secretary-General repatriate all uniformed  personnel from a contributing country in a given  mission if that country fails to take appropriate steps  to address credible allegations of sexual exploitation  and abuse, fails to hold the perpetrators accountable or  fails to inform the Secretary-General of the status of  such efforts.    I should like, if I could, to respond to Egypt's  intervention. We were accused, implicitly, politely, of  having an ulterior motive. I confess that I do have an  ulterior motive. My ulterior motive is actually, finally,  to do something about a cancer: the cancer of sexual  exploitation and abuse against people who trust the  United Nations flag. They see a peacekeeper coming  their way and they think, this is someone who is going  to help me; they do not think, I have to run, this is  someone who is going to rape me. That is not what they  think. That is not what they should ever think; but that  is what they are going to think, and that is with some of  them do think, because there is not accountability for  the crimes committed that is in any way commensurate  with what appears to be the scale of this problem.    So that is my ulterior motive, I confess. Sue me.  I also take note of the very important comment that  Egypt made, of the admission that the measures  contained in the resolution - measures requiring  accountability - would not have been passed by the  General Assembly. We agree; the General Assembly  has been totally paralysed. There are countries within  the negotiations that are going on as we speak that  have tried to water down the recommendations that  the Secretary-General has made. It would be one thing  if we were succeeding, if the system was working.  We come in here every day; we lament, we condemn.  We condemn the abuse and we condemn the lack of  accountability, and then we go to the General Assembly  and some of us try to water down provisions to try  to strengthen the system. What is up with that? One  cannot simultaneously try to water something down  in the General Assembly and then complain when  the body that sends peacekeepers out to try to protect  people actually takes responsibility for the fact that  some of those who were supposed to do the protecting  are committing sexual abuse. We cannot have it both  ways.    If the General Assembly had been able to actually  put in place methods for accountability, if the system  were working for girls like the ones Matthew just  quoted, who are now left with the children of the people  who have come and raped them and then gone back to  their countries never having been held accountable - if  the system had prevented these kinds of acts, or least  had some kind of accountability, we would not be  having this conversation. We are here only because it  just keeps happening.  So I think that it is very, very strange to hear  Member States call on the one hand for more aggressive  action or more accountability and then try to punt the  issue to a body that for years has been unable to come to  a consensus; and with several countries, again including  countries on the Council, trying to water down what  happens in the General Assembly, no reasonable person  could expect a different result.    Let me conclude with two messages. To the tens of  thousands of troops and police who serve honourably  in United Nations peacekeeping operations, we salute  them unequivocally for putting their lives on the line,  with little fanfare or recognition, for people who live in  countries far from their own. We and the civilians that  they protect with their bravery are completely indebted  to them for their service. As I did yesterday (see S/PV.7642), I would single out those members of the  Council that have contributed so many peacekeepers,  including Egypt, Senegal, China, Uruguay and, of  course, the United Kingdom, which is becoming  involved again. As a country that does not contribute  a lot of troops, we are in awe of their service. To the  victims of sexual exploitation and abuse by United  Nations peacekeepers, we pledge that we will do better.  We will do better to ensure that the Blue Helmets we  send as their protectors will not become perpetrators.  That is what we are striving for. But if they do, this  resolution demands that we, the Council, ensure that  the people who commit such violations, who violate the  good name of the United Nations and the good names of  their countries, be held accountable."

      "Text": "Mr. Kapambwe (Zambia): I have the honour to  address the Security Council on behalf of the member  States of the Southern African Development  Community (SADC) - namely, Angola, Botswana, the  Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lesotho,  Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique,  Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, the United Republic  of Tanzania, Zimbabwe and my own country, Zambia.    We would like to thank the Secretary-General, the  Special Adviser to the Secretary General on Gender  Issues and Advancement of Women, the Under-  Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, the Ad  Interim Executive Director of the United Nations  Development Fund for Women and the Coordinator of  the NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and  Security for their introductory statements, which were  very instructive.    SADC welcomes the opportunity, on the seventh  anniversary of the adoption of the landmark resolution  1325 (2000), to participate in this open debate on  women, peace and security, focused on achieving  coherent and effective implementation of Security  Council resolution 1325 (2000). As we are all aware,  the resolution, among other things, calls for the  incorporation of a gender perspective in negotiating    and implementing peace agreements, planning refugee  camps and peacekeeping operations, and reconstructing  war-torn societies. Today's debate therefore provides  us with an opportunity to assess the concrete and  specific efforts in the implementation of the resolution  at all levels and the role of the Security Council in such  efforts.    The adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) by the  Security Council and the six subsequent presidential  statements on women, peace and security provide a  solid framework for action in all areas of the peace  process. The importance of women's equal  participation and full involvement in all efforts to  maintain and promote peace and security cannot be  overstated. While some progress has been made in the  implementation of the resolution, greater coordinated  efforts are required to achieve the goal of full  implementation. In that regard, SADC calls on the  international community to render sustained support in  the development of national action plans, including  financial and human resources, that will eventually  drive the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).    We thank the Secretary-General for his report,  contained in document S/2007/567, on women and  peace and security. The report reviews and monitors  the implementation of the 2005-2007 United Nations  System-wide Action Plan and identifies gaps and  challenges, including in the areas of funding of gender  projects and insufficient institutional capacity for  gender mainstreaming. We must address those  challenges if we are to obtain the desired results. We  welcome the recommendations contained in the report,  which we believe will contribute to the acceleration of  the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).    We would like to commend the Inter-agency  Network on Women and Gender Equality, the Inter-  Agency Task Force on Women, Peace and Security, and  the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and  Advancement of Women for their commendable work  in coming up with a holistic and coherent 2008-2009  United Nations System-wide Action Plan, which will  serve as a results-based programme and monitoring and  reporting tool. The responsibility of ensuring the full  realization of the Plan rests with the international  community. The Security Council should hold national  Governments accountable for the implementation of  the Action Plan.    The high number of victims of violence continues  to be a concern for SADC. We are saddened that  women continue to bear the brunt of grave violations  of human rights, including violence and sexual abuses.  We condemn all those parties that perpetuate acts of  violence and abuse against women and children. We  call for the speedy investigation of all cases of Violence  and sexual abuse, especially those committed against  women and children. The culture of impunity must be  stopped by, among other things, bringing to justice all  the perpetrators.    SADC is encouraged by the progress on  mainstreaming gender in relevant policies and  programmes on disarmament, demobilization and  reintegration (DDR). It is necessary to recognize the  needs of women and girl ex-combatants in the DDR  process and to ensure that their concerns are taken on  board from the planning stages. We commend the work  that has been done by the United Nations Children's  Fund in reintegration projects that has led to the release  of girls from the armed forces in various countries.    We commend the various United Nations  agencies that have undertaken capacity-building  efforts, including the development of the training  models. We would, however, request that there be  synergy and coherence in the various training models  produced. We wish to reiterate that awareness of  resolution 1325 (2000) needs to be broadened and that  capacities at the national level to implement the  resolution need to be enhanced. In that endeavour, we  wish to underscore the importance of building capacity  at the local level and, in particular, the capacity of  national and local women's groups on the ground.    Experience has shown that the participation of  women in peace processes produces positive results,  especially because they, together with children, are the  major victims of atrocities committed in conflict.  Women need to hold decision-making positions. It is  imperative that women be encouraged and supported to  run for offices, especially in countries emerging from  conflicts. In that regard, we wish to commend the work  undertaken by United Nations agencies in facilitating  the promotion and effective participation of women in  decision-making processes.  In conclusion, I wish to state that SADC remains  committed to the full and effective implementation of  Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). We in the  international community have an obligation to ensure  that the rights of women the world over are protected  and that their place in all aspects of the peace process  is assured. It is their equal participation and their full  involvement that will contribute to the effective  maintenance and promotion of sustainable peace and  security."

      "Text": "Mr. Kim Hyun Chong (Republic of Korea): At  the outset, I wish to join previous speakers in  expressing my sincere gratitude to you, Mr. President,  for holding this open debate on women and peace and  security.    Over the seven years since the adoption of  Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women,  peace and security, much has been achieved in terms of  implementation by Member States, civil society and  the United Nations system. The Secretary-General's  report (S/2007/567) is a compilation of the reports on  progress made by each entity. It notes, for example, the  adoption by five entities of action plans for gender  mainstreaming in their work on conflict prevention, the  implementation of early-warning mechanisms by seven  entities and the appointment of gender advisers in  eleven peacekeeping missions.    Unfortunately, however, these efforts were rather  fragmented and incoherent. So far, the implementation  of resolution 1325 (2000) is far from sufficient.  Women continue to be excluded from or marginalized  in peacemaking and peacebuilding processes. There  has been some integration of gender perspectives, but it  has not been systematic, nor has it adequately  encompassed all facets of the process, including  conflict prevention, early warning, peacekeeping  operations, humanitarian responses, post-conflict  reconstruction and rehabilitation.    Most disturbing to the Republic of Korea is the  fact that sexual and gender-based violence in armed  conflict is growing in many places. My delegation is  particularly appalled by occurrences of systematic rape  and sexual violence.    Paragraph 10 of the resolution    \"Calls on all parties to armed conflict to take  special measures to protect women and girls from  gender-based violence, particularly rape and other  forms of sexual abuse, and all other forms of  violence in situations of armed conflict.\"  Paragraph 11 emphasizes the responsibility of all  States to put an end to impunity and to prosecute those  responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, and  war crimes, including those relating to sexual and other  violence against women and girls.    The brutal facts of sexual violence against  women and girls in many armed conflicts make it  horribly clear that the implementation of resolution  1325 (2000) has fallen far short of its intended aims.    My delegation believes that this poor  implementation is not the fault of the Secretary-  General or of the United Nations entities; rather, it is  the Security Council's lack of accountability and the  failure to implement the resolution.    The Secretary-General's report also identifies as  key challenges fragmentation and insufficient  institutional capacity for oversight and accountability  for system performance. The report explains that the  current action plan was not established as a tool for  monitoring, evaluation and accountability, and its  revised action plan attempts to fill that gap. While we  appreciate this effort to improve reporting, we do not  believe it is the solution to the greater problem.    What we most urgently need is a dedicated and  effective Security Council mechanism for overall  integration and implementation of the resolution in the  Council's work. This mechanism would bear the  responsibility to provide directives and to oversee,  monitor and evaluate such implementation. Secondly,  the Security Council urgently needs to address the  serious situation of the sexual violation of women and  girls.    It is the view of the Republic of Korea that, in  implementing the resolution, we should consider  regional approaches, including the utilization of  existing regional arrangements. Effective regional  entities could provide added value through their  established networks, solidarity, communication and  accessibility. However, we must keep in mind that the  ultimate accountability lies with the Security Council,  not with regional entities. Therefore, regional entities  should play a complementary role, not act as  substitutes. Nevertheless, as long as the participation of  regional entities is making a substantial contribution to  implementation, the regional approach will remain a  valid one.    In addition, my country hopes that the dialogue  for system-wide coherence regarding the gender  architecture will be finalized as soon as possible to  expedite a coherent response from the United Nations  system across the board for women's empowerment.    My delegation looks forward to a concrete  outcome from today's discussion. Through substantive  improvements in the implementation mechanism and  the strong will of the Security Council to end grave  sexual violence in armed conflict, we can make real  progress in implementation and reconfirm the  accountability of the Security Council. The Republic of  Korea is fully committed to ensuring the realization of  the United Nations promise to women in armed  conflicts."

      "Text": "Mr. Selim (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I would like  to thank the Kingdom of Spain and the President of the  Government of Spain for taking the initiative to convene  today's meeting on women and peace and security on  the fifteenth anniversary of the adoption of resolution  1325 (2000), and for inviting us to participate.    I would also like to thank the Secretary-General for  his efforts to highlight this important issue, including in  his most recent report on the resolution's implementation  (S/2015/7l6), which particularly emphasizes the  problem of resolving the crises facing us of the lack  of financing and inequitable selectivity in allocating  financial resources, as well as the direct links that the  report highlights among development issues, including  the importance of supporting countries' efforts to help  their peoples achieve their aspirations and of protecting  women in armed conflict and post-conflict situations.  Egypt supports the Secretary-General's call to promote  the role of women in its peacekeeping operations and its  mediation and conflict-resolution efforts.    Our discussion of the issues related to resolution  1325 (2000) has touched on the lack of adequate  attention to some of the chief problems it is aimed at,  in particular the degree to which women suffer under  foreign occupation, as well as the effects that can result  from an overemphasis on the connection between  international human rights law and international  humanitarian law, which can weaken the systems  available for providing protection in both peace and  war through the politicization of positions on the  various issues linked to the two types of law. Another  is insufficient attention to the priorities of national  sovereignty and respect for national legislation, along  with a reliance on unofficial studies that may not be as  precise in evaluating the progress made in achieving  goals for women and peace and security.    Terrorism is a threat to peace and security, along  with the armed conflicts that afflict many States and  regions around the world. In most cases, in fact, it forms  an integral part of every conflict. That is a threat our  communities face, and the threat level has increased of  late. It has affected States' abilities to carry out their  aspirations in terms of development and prosperity.  Although terrorism threatens the whole of society,  women are the most vulnerable. That is a cause to  which we will accord great interest as a non-permanent  member of the Security Council.    Egypt accords great interest to issues of women  and their role as a pivotal element in building and  maintaining peace. That interest is based on Egypt's  efforts in promoting the position of women in different  areas. It goes hand in hand with Egypt's broader vision  of the empowerment of women at all levels. Egypt has  supported the goals and rationale of resolution 1325  (2000) since its adoption, back in 2000, given the  importance of this and subsequent resolutions with  respect to the cause of women in conflict and post-  conflict situations. In that regard, Egypt's support has  taken many forms at both the regional and international  levels.    The National Council for Women of Egypt  has worked out a national plan for follow-up and  implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) in the  framework of the active role played by women in the  area of international conflict resolution. Egypt has  become one of 17 African States to develop that kind of  national plan. Over the last 15 years, since the adoption  of the resolution, Egypt has held a number of activities  on that issue. Two regional workshops were organized,  jointly with the United Nations and the League of Arab  States. Egypt has accorded special attention to issues  of training and capacity-building. From 2013 to 2015,  the Cairo Regional Centre for Training on Conflict-  Resolution and Peacekeeping in Africa has held seven  training courses, two courses for the training of trainers  and a workshop, all dedicated to habilitating staff and  to exchanging expertise on the implementation of  resolution 1325 (2000), under the theme \"Inclusion  of gender in peacekeeping and peace building\", to  be complemented by the holding of five additional  training courses in the same vein up to June 2016.    In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my  appreciation for the call to convene this important  meeting, in which we have been eager to participate in  the framework of Egypt's support for the efforts of the  United Nations, and the Security Council in particular,  to promote the role and status of women. Egypt will  also be sure to follow up on these issues regionally and  internationally in the context of its efforts to achieve  peace and security."

      "Text": "Mr. Stanislaus (Grenada): In my 12 years at the  United Nations, this is the first time that I avail myself  of the opportunity to address this body. Although I  have spoken many times in other United Nations  forums, I do so today because the item on the Council's  agenda - women, peace and security - is near and  dear to my heart as I approach my fiftieth wedding  anniversary.    I begin with the premise that the family is the  basis of society and that good family life is inextricably  intertwined with and interwoven into good national  life, which by extension can promote good  international life. From time immemorial, much of the  peace and harmony of the human family, especially in  conflict resolution therein, devolves upon the woman  of the house in her natural milieu as peacemaker.    Here lies a glorious opportunity to involve  women in peacemaking, peace-building and  peacekeeping at the highest level, nationally and  internationally. The age-old saying that the hand that  rocks the cradle rules the world remains only a good  adage unless women are brought into the mainstream  of decision-making at the highest political, educational,  social, economic, cultural and other levels. Then, and  only then, will the world give credence and substance  to the ancient Chinese proverb that women hold up half  the sky.    The Fourth World Conference on Women, held in  Beijing in September 1995, drew up the Beijing  Declaration and Programme of Action. It contains 12  subject areas, 6 of which are analysed in the United  Nations publication entitled \"The World's Women  2000: Trends and Statistics\". This was issued just  before the twenty-third special session of the General  Assembly in June 2000, entitled \"Women 2000:  Gender, Equality, Development and Peace for the  Twenty-First Century\". The intent was to show the  progress as well as the disparities between women and  men worldwide in health, human rights, political  decision-making, work, education and families.    Due to time constraints, my delegation will touch  briefly on three subject areas, namely, human rights,  political decision-making and work. While progress  has been made, we cannot fail to see that we are still a  long way from attaining the proclaimed goal of  women's rights as human rights, as was discussed in  the Millennium Report, or of equal rights of men and  women affirmed in the Charter, or of everyone, without  discrimination, having the right to equal pay for equal  work, as emphasized in article 23 of the Universal  Declaration of Human Rights.    Yet, gender imbalance is nowhere more  noticeable than in the workplace, where on average  women earn at least 30 per cent less than men for equal  work. Moreover, in the home, where a woman's  domestic role as spouse and mother is so vital to the  well-being of society, her work is always undervalued  and underpaid. Unpaid domestic work everywhere is  seen as a woman's responsibility.    Is it not incongruous that more than 50 years after  the ratification of the Universal Declaration of Human  Rights that the political landscape is still dominated by  men? Yet all international instruments and all national  legislatures enshrine the principle of equality between  men and women. Men have a responsibility therefore  to help remove the patriarchal dominance in society  and to allow the private virtues of women to go public.  Indeed, men of quality should never feel threatened by  women for equality.    Gender equality is predicated upon education of  girls and boys so that they can be empowered  throughout their life in today's globalizing world to  enter the gender mainstream of equal opportunity. The  report of the sixth session of the Commission on the  Status of Women, published on 25 March 2002, tells  how far we are from attaining this goal. Given the  opportunity for education, women and girls do as well  as men and boys. Some even think that women and  girls do better.    In 1916, psychologist George Stratton of the  University of Southern California described what he  considered - what he considered, remember, not what  I consider - the inherent superiority of the female  brain in seeing the whole picture. Writing on feminism  and psychology in Century Magazine, he expressed the  hope that women would dispel masculine illusions  when they took their rightful place in society.    Men, he said, tend to fix on cogs instead of flesh  and blood. Beginning with a generous wonder at  nature, men end up with fascination for the tool, the  scientific instrument. They establish governments to  give order to life and then end up coveting the  functions of government more than life. The masculine  genius for organization, Stratton said, needs women's  sense of the heart of things, not the trappings.    I cannot end without recalling from Greek  mythology the resourcefulness, the common sense and  the power of women. In Lysistrata, a masterpiece of  comedy written in 411 BC, Aristophanes tells of how,  during the silly and unnecessary Peloponnesian war  between the city-state of Athens and Sparta, the women  ended the military madness and exposed the absurdity  and futility of war by seizing, first, the Acropolis,  which contained the Treasury, then refusing to have  intimate relations with the returning men soldiers.  Taken together, their actions of seizure and sex strike  brought peace and development in a century very far  away and removed from the twenty-first century.    Finally, we men serve as the link between home,  where lessons are first taught and learned, and the  wider world, where they are applied in pursuit of peace  and security. An ancient Chinese philosopher captured  the contribution of women to peace and security best  when he said:    \"If there is light in the soul, there will be  beauty in the person. If there is beauty in the  person, there will be harmony in the home. If  there is harmony in the home, there will be order  in the nation. If there is order in the nation, there  will be peace in the world.\"    What a beautiful tribute to womanhood. And on  this score, I want to greet, salute and thank Ms. Angela  King and Ms. Noeleen Heyzer and, of course, Mr.  Guehenno, for their presentations today."

      "Text": "Mr. Motomura (Japan): At the outset, I would  like to thank you, Mr. President, for your initiative in  convening this open meeting as a follow-up to Security  Council resolution 1325 (2000), entitled \"Women and  peace and security\".    With the adoption of Council resolution 1325  (2000) in October 2000 and the subsequent statement  by the President of the Security Council in October last  year, the linkage between international peace and  security and gender issues has been increasingly  recognized throughout the international community.  Indeed, there is a growing awareness of the negative  impact that armed conflict has on women and children  in particular and of the importance of women's  participation in post-conflict peace processes.    On the other hand, what is now needed is more  detailed information and analysis of concrete examples,  as well as recommendations and practical measures.  My delegation, therefore, looks forward to the results  of the study conducted by Ms. Angela King, Special  Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of  Women. We also look forward to the results of the  assessments by the two independent experts appointed  by the United Nations Development Fund for Women  on the impact of armed conflict on women and the role  of women in peace-building, as well as the report of  the Secretary-General to be submitted later this year.    The conclusions of these studies and reports will  be crucial in terms of giving direction and providing  concrete methodologies for the steady implementation  of resolution 1325 (2000).    Allow me to briefly describe the basic views and  concrete actions taken by my Government as regards  gender mainstreaming in the area of conflicts and  peacekeeping. First, I would like to draw special  attention to the active role Afghan women are playing  the post-conflict reconstruction of their country. As  Prime Minister Koizumi stated at the international  conference on reconstruction assistance to Afghanistan,  held in Tokyo earlier this year, one of the highest  priorities of Japan's assistance for Afghanistan's  reconstruction is the empowerment of women.    Japan has thus sent an expert to the Ministry of  Women's Affairs and has extended financial support  for the establishment of women's centres in  Afghanistan. Moreover, in February, Japan set up the  Advisory Council on Assistance to Women in  Afghanistan, taking into account the proposals of the  Security Council, and is determined to continuously  support the tremendous efforts the Afghan women  themselves are making to restore peace in their country.    Secondly, with the mandates of peacekeeping  operations becoming more multidimensional, it is  increasingly important that women's views are  integrated into their respective activities. I am pleased  to note that earlier this year the Japanese Government  for the first time dispatched seven women  peacekeepers to the United Nations peacekeeping  operations in East Timor, where they are now engaged  in coordination activities in such areas as  communication and translation. In addition, an  increasing number of Japanese women who are United  Nations staff members are working in the civilian  components of peacekeeping missions. The  Government of Japan will continuously strive to  increase the participation of women in peace operations  in various areas.    Thirdly, given the particular importance of gender  mainstreaming in the field, the Japanese Government  supported the recommendation of the Special  Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, which was  endorsed by the General Assembly, that \"the work of  gender focal points should have the proper back-up in  the Secretariat\". In this context, my delegation hopes  that, as stated in General Assembly resolution 56/293  in June this year, the Secretariat will develop and  clearly explain a coherent policy on gender  mainstreaming in all United Nations peacekeeping  activities.    In October we will celebrate the second  anniversary of the adoption of Security Council  resolution 1325 (2000). My delegation hopes that the  entire discussion at today's meeting will prove useful  in the ongoing efforts to follow up the resolution and  will be fully reflected in the report of the Secretary-  General.    In closing, let me assure you, Mr. President, of  Japan's readiness to contribute to the goals of this  important resolution in cooperation with all other  interested Member States."

      "Text": "Ms. Gallardo Hernandez (El Salvador) (spoke in Spanish): Allow me to express my Government's  satisfaction about the fact that the Security Council has  continued to address this important issue. I would also  like to thank you, Mr. President, for your initiative to  convene this open debate, on the fourth anniversary of  the adoption of resolution 1325 (2004), on the subject  of women and peace and security. This is an  exceedingly important subject, as it leads us to take up  critical areas of the Beijing Platform for Action dealing  with women and armed conflict. It also leads us to  address efforts aimed at the maintenance of  international peace and security, which is the primary  role of the Council.    The Government of El Salvador would like to  reiterate its concern about the fact that civilians - and  especially women, children and older persons -  continue to suffer from the devastating consequences  of armed conflict, including as refugees and internally  displaced persons. As we all know, that has a grave  impact on lasting peace and reconciliation.    The experience of the people of El Salvador with  armed conflict during more than a decade enables us  today to be able to pass on some lessons learned  associated with the subject under discussion. Among  those lessons, we wish to point out that women are a  basic pillar in maintaining family cohesion, struggling  for daily existence, keeping a clear focus on their  children's priority needs, passing on values and life  experiences and becoming the person who establishes  spaces for dialogue and agreement, thereby making her  the one who can most accurately identify possible  areas of intolerance.    The Government of El Salvador would like to  emphasize that it is important and necessary for women  to participate comprehensively and on an equal footing  in all initiatives designed to maintain and promote  peace and security, as well as in United Nations  peacekeeping and peace-building efforts. It is therefore  essential that we promote and strengthen women's  participation in the decision-making processes  associated with the prevention and resolution of  conflict. Similarly, we believe it essential for women to  have access to information channels in order that they  may be able to identify potential sources of violence,  open up new spaces for dialogue among society and  instil the values of tolerance and peace, which are  essential if peace is to last.    My delegation would like to point out that, for  peace to be genuine, women must be able to benefit  from peace dividends. In our opinion, this is one of the  most important lessons we have learned, because  women are capable of looking beyond their individual  interests to focus on priorities that strengthen the  family and its surroundings, very often at the expense  of their own needs.  The Government of El Salvador supports the  initiatives designed to incorporate a gender perspective  in peacekeeping operations. For this reason, we  welcome the decision of the Security Council, set out  in resolution 1325 (2000), to give all peacekeeping  personnel specialized training in the area of protection,  special needs and the human rights of women, children  and the elderly in conflict situations.    In this regard, we urge the Security Council to  draw on the accumulated experience and specialized  expertise in gender issues of the relevant institutions of  the United Nations. In particular, we would like to  refer here to the United Nations International Research  and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women,  as well as the successful experiences of each and every  Member State.    At the same time, we urge the Secretary-General  to continue his efforts to broaden the role and  contributions of women to United Nations operations,  both on the ground and at Headquarters. This would  apply in particular to military observers, civilian police  and personnel working on the promotion and protection  of human rights and humanitarian tasks.    In conclusion, allow me once again to state that  the Government of El Salvador is ready to continue  supporting all the initiatives and measures taken by the  Security Council to promote a gender perspective and  the advancement of women. It is also willing to  contribute to actions designed to protect and promote  the rights of women in conflict situations, giving them  scope to participate in the long-term process of  reconciliation - the only thing that can guarantee a  new form of coexistence within countries."

      "Text": "Mr. Khan (Indonesia): Allow me to begin by  commending the President's work on convening today's  debate on the issue of sexual violence in conflict. This  timely debate highlights the urgent need to address the  various forms of violence perpetrated against women  and girls. Despite all the achievements and progress  that have been made in promoting the protection and  rights of women, such violence persists all over the  world. Indonesia also wishes to thank the Secretary-  General for his report on sexual violence in conflict  (S/2013/l49), which is a valuable starting point for our  deliberations today on improving ways to eliminate  and prevent violence against women, particularly in  conflict situations.    At the outset, Indonesia associates itself with the  statement delivered by the representative of Viet Nam  on behalf of the member countries of the Association of  Southeast Asian Nations.    Indonesia notes with deep concern the use of  sexual violence as a tactic of war and one that worsens  its consequences, as highlighted in the Secretary-  General's report. Against that backdrop, Indonesia  condemns all forms of violence against women and  girls in armed conflicts, particularly sexual violence,  which, as the report states, predominantly affects  women and girls but can also affect men and boys.  We wish to reaffirm our support for resolution 1325  (2000), the first to specifically address the impact of  war on women and women's contributions to conflict  resolution and sustainable peace. The follow-up Security  Council resolutions on women, peace and security also  constitute a milestone for protection and empowerment  measures for women in the special situation of conflict.    Indonesia commends the adoption of the agreed  conclusions of the fifty-seventh session of the  Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), last month,  as a manifestation of the intergovernmental efforts  that have been made by countries under the United  Nations framework. The agreement reached on the  agreed conclusions is a step forward in strengthening  countries' commitment to tackling violence against  women and girls.    The CSW conclusions send a clear and strong  message: violence against women and girls committed  in armed conflict and post-conflict situations is strongly  condemned; sexual and gender-based violence, which  affects victims, families, communities and societies,  is recognized; and effective accountability and redress  measures, as well remedies, are required.    At the national level, Indonesia's national action  plan on human rights serves as a strong platform for our  commitment to eliminate and prevent violence against  women. The process of drafting a presidential decree is  ongoing, as a legal basis to formulate a national action  plan on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  When completed, the action plan, among things, will  cover all phases ofthe peace process - from prevention  to ending conflict to recovery from social conflict.    Indonesia wishes to highlight some of the main  challenges in our efforts to eliminate and further    prevent violence against women, including sexual  violence: first, insufficient gender-sensitive policies;  secondly, inadequate implementation of legal and  policy frameworks; thirdly, inadequate data collection,  analysis and research; fourthly, the lack of financial  and human resources and insufficient allocation of  such resources; and, fifthly, the lack of comprehensive,  consistent, sustained, transparent and adequately  monitored and evaluated efforts.    Those gaps have yet to be bridged by States as the  bearers of the primary responsibility in addressing the  issue ofviolence against women and its impact, in order  to translate commitments into practical approaches and  actions on the ground, to fashion more compassionate  responses for victims, to pursue more aggressive  prosecutions of perpetrators and to create more secure  communities and environments.    With its multifold economic, social and cultural  consequences, sexual violence in conflict hampers not  only women and men victims, but also their families  and communities. Therefore, Indonesia supports the  six-point priority agenda established by the former  and current Special Representatives of the Secretary-  General on Sexual Violence in Conflict.    To conclude, Indonesia would like to reiterate the  importance of the international community, including  the United Nations, as the key stakeholder, joining  hands and providing support for States to address the  remaining gaps and tackle the gravity of the situation.  Indonesia also urges all parties to conflict to comply  with international humanitarian and human rights law."

      "Text": "Mr. Dauth (Australia): Thank you, Mr. President,  for the opportunity to speak today. It would be remiss  of me not to begin, Sir, without acknowledging your  personal commitment and energy in carrying this  debate forward. We also thank Under-Secretary-  General Guehenno and Amy Smythe for their very  helpful presentations this morning. At the risk of  annoying the interpreters, I shall summarize my  prepared remarks to make them even briefer than they  were, in the interest of moving things along this  afternoon. But I cannot leave out the first paragraph,  which notes that this is the third anniversary of the  adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) and that we,  Australia, are proud to reaffirm our commitment to that  resolution.    Resolution 1325 (2000) was the first resolution  addressing gender issues to be passed by the Security  Council. A great deal has been accomplished since  then, but a great deal more needs to be done. Not least,  of course, because women and girls remain  overwhelmingly the main victims of armed conflict,  often victims in the most horrific of ways.    Women continue to be significantly under-  represented in peace-building, peacekeeping and post-  conflict reconciliation and reconstruction, despite the  acknowledgement by resolution 1325 (2000) of their  importance in those areas. So much still needs to be  done.    We have some very relevant experience in the  Pacific region which bears attention at the United  Nations and by Member States more generally. In  particular, we have built issues of the impact of conflict  on women and children into our peace, conflict and  development policy, which is now an integral part of  our aid policy.    We have had experience, in both the Solomon  Islands and Bougainville, of drawing particularly on  the contribution which women in both of those conflict  areas have been able to make. In particular it is the  case in the Solomon Islands and Bougainville that  women have made a more than equal contribution  toward the achievement of peace.    I am pleased to note that we have a senior  Australian policewoman as the current United Nations  Police Commissioner in East Timor. Police  Commissioner Sandra Peisly is the only woman  holding such a position in an operation of the  Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO). We  make a concerted effort to include women  peacekeepers in our peacekeeping contributions around  the world.    We remain committed to the sustainable  implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). We  commend the first steps that have been taken towards  that objective, including through the appointment of a  Gender Adviser in the Department of Peacekeeping  Operations, as others have noted, and the development  of gender action plans in the Department for  Disarmament Affairs and the Office for the  Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. We note also  that DPKO is developing a field guide to gender  mainstreaming and has issued a gender and  peacekeeping training manual. In all of this,  Jean-Marie Guehenno deserves commendation for his  leadership.    But, as I have already said, much more needs to  be done. Without further concrete action, resolution  1325 (2000) will only remain a set of aspirational  standards. In that context there are some questions  which many others have asked but which, I think,  DPKO and the Secretariat more generally need  constantly to address. What are the hurdles in  achieving the implementation of resolution 1325  (2000) in current peacekeeping operations? Has the  Secretariat put into place any institutional mechanisms  to monitor progress made in the implementation of  resolution 1325 (2000)? What efforts are being made to  ensure that the recommendations in resolution 1325  (2000) are mainstreamed into the work programmes of  all United Nations agencies?    The responsibility for implementing resolution  1325 (2000) rests not only with the Secretariat.  Member States - and, in particular, Council  members - also have important responsibilities, not  least in ensuring that mandates take full account of  gender perspectives. We all now need to focus on  practical steps to give effect to resolution 1325 (2000).  Australia stands ready to do its part."

      "Text": "Ms. King: I am particularly honoured today, as  Special Adviser on Gender Issues, to have the  opportunity to speak in this debate, which is so  historic, when for the first time the Council has decided  to devote an entire open discussion to the topic  \"Women and peace and security\".    It is only fairly recently that the experience of  women and girls in armed conflict has been discussed,  and then discussion has usually concentrated on their  role as victims. Today's debate will show that we have  come a long way in a relatively short time. Your  country's strong leadership, Mr. President, in holding  the landmark May seminar which marked this year's  tenth anniversary of the United Nations Transition  Assistance Group resulted in the historic Windhoek  Declaration and Namibia Plan of Action on  \"Mainstreaming a Gender Perspective in  Multidimensional Peace Support Operations\". This  achievement has won universal admiration among all  those fighting for women's right to participate in all  aspects of the peace process. It and your distinguished  chairing of the General Assembly's twenty-third  special session, \"Women 2000: gender equality,  development and peace for the twenty-first century\",  which immediately followed in June, constitute  important steps along the way to considering the  United Nations peace operations from the point of view  of both women and men.    Other important developments have led to today's  meeting. They include the Council's decision to take a  thematic approach to its work; the recognition that the  Council gave - under the chair of Bangladesh - on  International Women's Day, 8 March, to women as  actors in the peace process; the discussion on the  situation of women in Afghanistan, which took place in  April, led by the representative of Canada; and the  Council's resolution 1314 (2000) of 11 August.    The timeliness of this discussion is also  significant. The Secretary-General has just returned  from an area where he undoubtedly had an opportunity  to see at first hand the role women and men should  play in their societies to bring about peace and to  rebuild those societies. The discussion also coincides  with the consideration of the Brahimi Panel's report  (8/2000/809) on peace operations and its  implementation.    There are three broad areas to be considered in  the context of today's discussion: how armed conflict  affects women; how women actually respond to  conflict, the peace process and post-conflict  reconstruction; and how we plan strategically for a  future in which women are equal partners with men in  enhancing our effectiveness in peace operations.    Today I would like to concentrate on the two  latter points, drawing on my experience as Chief of  Mission in the United Nations Observer Mission in  South Africa (UNOMSA).    What do women actually do in conflict situations,  and how do they respond? The Secretary-General has  repeatedly emphasized the changing nature of war. He  has noted that modern warfare is increasingly  conducted within, rather than between, States, and that  the Security Council is now called on to deal with such  conflicts. He has stressed that more and more non-State  actors are protagonists in armed conflict; even children  become involved. The proliferation of small arms and  the ease with which they can be acquired, clearly  shown in the Department for Disarmament Affairs and  Department of Public Information video documentary  \"Armed to the Teeth\", has also added a new dimension.    The socio-economic fabric of a country has now  to be the major focus of attention. Societal dynamics  thus become a key guide to finding entry points into  resolving disputes. Groups within each society, and  especially women's groups, non-governmental,  religious and other groups, have a major role to play.  Whether these groups were formed before the conflict  or during it is not important. What is important is that  they must be part of all stages of the peace  negotiations, in planning for the future, in rebuilding  and in crafting preventive strategies to avoid conflict.    Often, those of us who have seen the value of  women's participation in peace operations at first hand  are challenged by the sceptics to present empirical  rather than anecdotal findings. In this connection, I am  pleased to report on the results of a joint three-year  effort of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations  (DPKO), my office and the Division for the  Advancement of Women of the Department of  Economic and Social Affairs, a study that was  supported by the generous funding of several Member  States. This study, \"Mainstreaming a Gender  Perspective in Multidimensional Peace Operations\" has  just been finalized.  The study looks at five peace operations, in  Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia, El Salvador,  Namibia and South Africa. It answers the sceptics by  giving objective and empirical findings on what  women staff do in missions; whether and how they  influence the outcomes; and how their participating  equally with men can improve the efficiency of United  Nations peacekeeping. The Windhoek Declaration and  the Namibia Plan of Action were informed by these  findings.    Exactly what does this study tell us? It shows  unequivocally that when there is a critical mass of  women in a mission - at least 30 per cent - local  women are more easily mobilized to join peace  committees. This occurred in South Africa, El Salvador  and Namibia, where women actively promoted voter  education and the rights of individual women to vote.  In other words, women's participation in United  Nations missions empowers local women and may  inspire them to organize for the achievement of a  democratic society.    Women's participation has the capacity to expand  the debate a little further so that it may encompass  more diverse subjects, including those that may be  more relevant to women and children. Women are  frequently less hierarchical in dealing with local  communities and listen more, thereby having better  insights into the root causes of conflict. Local women  are more likely to confide in women peacekeepers on  such matters as rape and other sexual violence. The  presence of a critical mass of women appears to foster  confidence and trust among the local population, and  this is critical to successful operations, such as in El  Salvador. Women are active negotiators and able to see  more clearly issues that affect women differently than  men.    Women's participation in all aspects of a mission  can help to break down stereotypes held by women in  many local communities, especially where women  peacekeepers serve in a broad spectrum of the activities  of a mission. This has had a spin-off effect on the  participation of local women in decision-making  positions. Women political monitors are just as willing  and capable of serving in dangerous or isolated areas as  men, and do so just as effectively.    The study also shows that mixed teams of women  and men, a significant proportion of women team  leaders, women special representatives or heads of  mission, or a conscious effort by a special  representative to seek the best staff, whether women or  men, has a positive influence on the outcome. Women  also respond by participating in the troop-contributing  countries' military and civilian police contingents. The  Department of Peacekeeping Operations has made  strenuous efforts to encourage Member States to send  women on missions, on the basis of equity, as their  presence can assist in defusing potentially tense  situations. Much more should be done in order to  encourage women to enter this service.    What do this and other studies tell us about what  local women do? There is abundant evidence to show  that even when having to flee to safety with their  families or protecting them in refugee or displaced-  persons camps, women take on a number of peace-  building activities.    Women are active at both formal and informal  levels. With few exceptions, women are not present in  formal peace negotiations. However, women have been  part of these negotiations, as we saw in the field in  Burundi, and in Guatemala and South Africa. Somali  women helped to bring the clan leaders back into the  negotiations at one stage and were permitted to join the  negotiations as observers.    Most of the activities, however, take place at the  informal level. Grass-roots women's organizations in  several countries have sponsored peace education;  encouraged child soldiers to lay down arms; organized  groups advocating peace across party and ethnic lines;  organized campaigns against small arms, such as the  Organization of African Unity (OAU) African  Women's Committee on peace and development;  influenced repatriation processes and established  services for returning exiles, such as in Guatemala;  contributed to ending conflict; negotiated the release of  hostages; and established legal support groups to get  recognition for women's rights to land and household  property which may have been in the name of a spouse  killed or \"disappeared\" in a conflict.    Women at the local level are a rich resource  waiting to be systematically tapped by the international  community. Many aspects of these informal activities  have been encouraged, supported financially and  documented by the United Nations and its agencies. In  this connection, in addition to the work of the  Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the  Department of Political Affairs, the Office for the  Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the  Department for Disarmament Affairs should be  mentioned. Special mention should also be made of the  work of the Office of the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees, the Office of the High  Commissioner for Human Rights, the United Nations  Children's Fund, the World Food Programme and the  World Health Organization. The United Nations  Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations  Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and the  United Nations Centre for Human Settlements  (Habitat) should also be credited with pioneering work  at the national and grass-roots levels. Good practices  have been identified, studied and published, including  the study by the United Nations Research Institute for  Social Development, \"Women and Post-Conflict  Reconstruction\". The exchange of information on these  practices has enabled the United Nations system to  encourage States engaged in rehabilitation to work in  partnership with and sustain women's groups and civil  society engaged in these essential but often  unrecognized activities. Capacity-building for  leadership and governance led by UNDP and UNIFEM  has greatly facilitated women's ability to play  constructive roles.    These entities are all members of the  Administrative Committee on Coordination's Inter-  Agency Committee on Women and Gender Equality,  which I chair. We have lately formed a Task Force on  Women and Peace and Security to strengthen  collaboration on this critical issue.    This brings me to our vision for the future. The  basic blueprint appears in the Beijing Platform for  Action, the Beijing + 5 outcome document, the  Windhoek Declaration and the Namibia Plan of Action.  It also appears in the many powerful statements from  women's groups that we heard yesterday in the  Council's Arria-formula meeting.    The planning of any mission must include gender  equality aspects. The mandate of the mission and the  guidelines for special representatives must clearly  indicate that gender considerations must be integrated  into the mission's goals and the head of mission be  accountable. Each mission should have a plan for  incorporating gender issues into all aspects of the  mission's work. There should be a gender unit,  adequately staffed and resourced to provide the  necessary backstopping on the mission site, and one in  DPKO for overall oversight. I am pleased to state that  DPKO has established two such units- one in East  Timor and one in Kosovo - and gender focal points in  Sierra Leone and Western Sahara. All sectors of the  transition or rebuilding process should take gender  issues into account. Greater attention must be paid to  ensuring the appointment of women as special  representatives, in accordance with the Brahimi report  and the call by women heads of State and Government  of 5 September. The Council may wish to ensure that  all the reports that it receives on missions contain  information and data on the extent to which a gender  perspective has been introduced and on the number and  level of women working in the various missions.  Working with the agencies on the ground, the political  and development wings of the mission should organize  the mobilization of community groups, especially  women's groups, and expand the pool of skills needed  to sustain the peace process. A roster of such groups  could be kept by DPKO, in collaboration with regional  bodies and agencies. The code of conduct for  peacekeepers should be regularly updated and where  there are infringements, there should be a continuation  of apprehension and discipline. Should it be decided to  appoint a new assistant secretary-general in the  Department of Peacekeeping Operations, as proposed  in the Panel's report, strong consideration should be  given to appointing a woman to one of the three  assistant secretary-general posts in the Department.    In closing, may I recall the main finding of the  joint study made by the Department of Peacekeeping  Operations and the Division for the Advancement of  Women. It was that the most important lesson learned  is that lessons are not always learned. Lessons from  Namibia and South Africa had little effect on  Cambodia or Bosnia Herzegovina, for example. Gender  equality issues are absolutely essential to the success of  any peace operation. We cannot exclude half the  world's resources from participating in peace.  The fundamental human right to have and to  enjoy equality is a given. It was emphasized by the  Beijing Conference and reaffirmed again in the  Beijing +5 outcome document and even more so at the  Millennium Declaration. There can be no peace  without gender equality and no development without  both peace and equality. Without the equal and fair  participation of women in decision-making positions in  the United Nations and also in Member States, as well  as in this central organ of the United Nations, we will  never achieve the vision outlined in the United Nations  Charter. May this discussion and the decisions that  follow be those in which we demonstrate that, at least  in the area of women and peace and security, this is one  lesson that we have learned and intend to put into  action."

      "Text": "Ms. Soderberg (United States): The United  States warmly welcomes this open debate on women  and peace and security. We pay a special tribute to  Secretary-General Annan for his remarks and fully  concur with his report statement:    \"Equality of rights, opportunities and access to  resources between men and women are  fundamental requirements\" (A/52/87]/, para. 89)    in building a durable peace.    I want to join Ambassador Durrant in paying a  special tribute to you, Mr. President, and to  Ambassador Andjaba, for your leadership in bringing  about this important meeting. I also want to pay a  special warm welcome to Ms. Angela King, Special  Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of  Women, and to Ms. Heyzer, Executive Director of the  United Nations Development Fund for Women. This  invitation this morning is long overdue and I hope that  this body will meet the challenge that you have put to  us today. It is an historic challenge that you put before  us. We warmly welcome that.    I also want to pay a special welcome to our guests  in the gallery. I think your participation and support are  very important and I think this is the first time I have  ever heard applause in this Chamber. So you are  enlivening it.    Today's meeting must not only make us more  aware of the important role women play in preventing  conflict, encouraging reconciliation and helping to  rebuild conflict-ridden societies, but it also must spur  us to concrete action. We, in the international  community, have failed to make maximum use of the  contributions of women in our efforts to promote peace  and security throughout the world. As Secretary of  State Albright pointed out in a recent speech to a group  of businesswomen, \"in too many places, women remain  an undervalued and underdeveloped human resource.\"    We applaud the unwavering efforts of the United  Nations and its specialized agencies to confront  problems that mostly affect women. The work of these  bodies and the international community's moral and  financial support for such efforts has changed the lives  of many, both young and old. Working together, we  have taken steps to promote equality of opportunity,  educate women and girls, change the unbalanced  inheritance and divorce laws, advance political and  economic rights and eradicate traditional practices  harmful to women and girls.    Much of our attention has been directed toward  protecting women, especially from the devastating  effects of armed conflict, including forced  displacement, trafficking of women, torture, rape and  other acts of sexual violence, as well as a host of other  crimes. For example, the 1993 World Conference on  Human Rights focused on women solely as victims of  armed conflict. While the issue of protection of women  cannot be ignored, I hope that Security Council action  will emphasize the leadership role women can and  should play in restoring peace.    Women are an under-utilized positive force for  peace. The Fourth World Conference on Women  recognized that they must be fully involved in  preventing and resolving conflicts. We must actively  promote formal mechanisms, which support a  consistent female presence at the peace table, in  peacekeeping operations and in the peace building  efforts to reconstruct institutions vital to lasting  stability.    The Secretary-General, by appointing qualified  women to visible positions of influence, has set a  laudable example for us all to follow. Deputy  Secretary-General Louise Frechette, High  Commissioners Mary Robinson and Sadako Ogata, the  United Nations Children's Fund's Carol Bellamy and  the World Food Programme's Catherine Bertini, to  name just a few, demonstrate daily that women do  make a difference in defusing conflicts and promoting  equality, peace and security. The challenge before us is  to emulate their achievements in other international  and regional organizations, in national Governments  and across all levels of society. The United States  applauds the appointment of these women, but we want  to see more done.    In particular, we need more women as Special  Representatives of the Secretary-General, as special  envoys and as human rights investigators and monitors.  We hope the Secretary-General will strive to appoint  more, fully qualified women to these positions, as well  as those within his own Secretariat. We strongly  encourage Member States to bring such candidates to  his attention and to support the idea of the United  Nations maintaining a roster of qualified women  maintained as part of the United Nations Standby  Arrangements System.    We need more than influential women at the  highest levels of power and prestige. The United  Nations must ensure that women's voices are heard  wherever the United Nations assists in the settlement of  conflicts and in post-conflict peace-building. With all  due respect to my colleagues, just look around this  room. A good place to start would be for Member  States to appoint more women as ambassadors to the  United Nations. Certainly one woman Permanent  Representative, the distinguished Patricia Durrant, out  of 15 on the Security Council, is at least 6 or 7 too few.  Ten women out of 189 Permanent Representatives is a  sad commentary on the state of women in leadership  positions of Member States. If we are to heed President  Theo-Ben Gurirab's challenge that we all just heard in  the video to make women half of every solution,  Member States must be able to do better than five per  cent.    In all phases of peacekeeping and peace-building  missions the presence of women must be visible and  consistent. When possible, fact-finding missions should  include gender advisors and the terms of reconciliation  and reconstruction should draw on the expertise of  women's community groups. The immediate aftermath  of a conflict provides a unique window of opportunity  to rebuild, with the equal participation of women, the  public security institutions vital to lasting stability. In  order to facilitate this, States should be committed to  gender balance in their contributions to civilian police  and other peacekeeping contingents and to assisting  other States in achieving a gender-balanced  perspective.    In place after place, from Northern Ireland to  Guatemala to South Africa, we see that women are  most effective when they are able to organize and be  heard. Our First Lady's involvement in the organization  Vital Voices has demonstrated around the world this  fact time and again. We, as members of the Security  Council, cannot be content with token representation of  half of the world's population. The Security Council  should consider establishing a very specifically  mandated expert panel or working group to report on  mechanisms that will ensure equal representation of  women in peacekeeping and peace-building operations.    We also need to prepare our United Nations  peacekeepers for encounters with the entire population  in a mission area. This means that peacekeepers-  military, civilian and civil servants - should be trained  in gender issues; and it means that they who violate  women's most basic rights must be brought to justice.  The training should focus on codes of conduct and  cultural and societal norms with respect to women, and  on the study of the Convention on the Elimination of  all Forms of Discrimination Against Women.    At managerial levels training should include the  participation of women in institution-building,  particularly in rule-of-law areas. The Training Unit of  the Department of Peacekeeping Operations should  develop exportable modules that may be used in  national and regional programmes, and all United  Nations training programmes must include elements on  gender issues.    We encourage States to assist in other meaningful  ways as well. The United States, for example, has  provided funding to the Office of the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees to support the  Bosnian Women's Initiative, which promotes the  reintegration of women into the economy. It  emphasizes training, legal assistance and support for  micro-enterprise projects. Likewise, the United States  has supported the Rwanda Women's Initiative to  address refugee women's reintegration. The  Department of State has also provided support for the  Women's Commission for Refugee Women and  Children, which operates in Sierra Leone, Afghanistan,  Azerbaijan and the Sudan. Those programmes not only  provide services to women in war-torn areas, but they  also seek to integrate them into the political and  economic lives of their countries.    As we move forward we should take care that our  efforts to further empower women in no way  disadvantage men. We should strive for equality, not  special treatment. What we really need is a  commitment from Member States of the United  Nations, the Secretariat and all concerned to honour the  obligations and promises already made to women. We  should now look ahead to concrete initiatives in  support of those promises.    In closing, let me again commend you and your  delegation, Mr. President, for calling this important  meeting today. I hope this meeting will be the  beginning of regular discussions in this Chamber, and  that one day there will be equal gender representation  around this table and throughout these halls."

      "Text": "Mr. Laassel (Morocco) (spoke in French): Allow  me at the outset to convey to you, Sir, on behalf of the  Moroccan delegation, our gratitude for the convening  of this debate. I thank for their briefings Secretary-  General Ban Ki-moon; Ms. Navanethem Pillay, High  Commissioner for Human Rights; and Ms. Phumzile  Mlambo-Ngcuka, Executive Director of UN Women.  I welcome Ms. Mlambo-Ngcuka's appointment and  assure her of our full cooperation and support as she  discharges her mission. We also thank Ms. Brigitte  Balipou, Chair of the NGO Working Group on Women,  Peace and Security, for her constructive contribution.    My delegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-  General on women, peace and security (S/2013/525)  and the adoption of resolution 2122 (2013) on the issue.  The report takes stock of the actions and initiatives of  Member States in the framework of implementation  of the resolution, especially in strengthening women's  participation in decision-making, integrating gender-  specific issues in peacekeeping operations and  training staff who participate in those operations.  The report confirms that much work remains, despite  the significant progress of women's participation in  peacekeeping operations and their representation in the  decision-making process.    The signing of peace agreements and ceasefire  agreements and the implementation of national action  plans and programmes for the protection of women in  conflict-affected countries have made it possible to  identify, in a more appropriate way, the ways and means  likely to promote women's rights and to strengthen their  participation in efforts to prevent and resolve conflicts  and in post-conflict reconstruction.    My delegation supports the initiatives of the Team  of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in  Conflict to assist States in strengthening the rule of  law, transitional justice and security sector reform. My  delegation also supports the elaboration by the Standing  Committee on Women, Peace and Security of the  strategic framework intended to assist Member States  in achieving their interim objectives, in preparation for  the meeting planned for 2015 on the implementation  of resolution 1325 (2000) at national, regional and  international levels.    Effective and optimal empowerment of women  in the context of peacebuilding and post-conflict  reconstruction involves the collective and coordinated  action of the international community and the United  Nations system, through strengthening protection and  prevention measures adapted to specific contexts that  will facilitate the implementation of the resolution.    The establishment of genuine peace requires  the establishment of inclusive and durable political,  economic and social structures. Within that  framework, local women's entities are a driving  force in empowering women and strengthening good  governance. My delegation welcomes the work carried  out in the framework of the United Nations system  to strengthen women's capacities and involvement in  mediation and peacebuilding processes. Similarly, it  supports the implementation of the Secretary-General's  seven-point action plan (see S/2010/466), which enables  greater consideration of gender issues in peacebuilding  operations.    As for protection, my delegation notes with concern  that refugee or displaced women continue to suffer most  from generalized insecurity, difficult living conditions  and limited access to humanitarian assistance. The  same is true for refugee women who lack documents  and often face gender-based discrimination, especially  in accessing basic social services. In that connection,  it is essential that Member States - especially the  States parties to the 1951 Convention relating to the  Status of Refugees - comply with their obligations  and register refugees in their territory. Registration and  identification programmes can have a positive impact  in empowering women refugees.    My delegation welcomes the efforts undertaken  by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations  (DPKO) in the protection of women in armed conflict  and the consideration of gender-specific issues in the  framework of the maintenance of peace. We stress that  it is important that DPKO strengthen its work on the  ground, in coordination with the relevant parties.    While the responsibility to put an end to the tragic  consequences of armed conflict for women and children  lies with States, coordinated and sustained action  among the various national and United Nations actors  involved in the implementation of resolution 1325  (2000) is necessary to strengthen existing initiatives.    Firm political will and full commitment of Member  States to the measures in resolution 1325 (2000)  will guarantee the active participation of women in  national, regional and international institutions for  the prevention, protection and management of conflict  situations."

      "Text": "Mr. Jfirgenson (Estonia): Ithankyou, Mr. President,  for convening today's meeting on this vital topic. We  were impressed by the comprehensive statements by  Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, Special  Representative Pramila Patten and Ms. Razia Sultana.    Estonia aligns itself with the statement delivered  earlier by the observer of the European Union and  reiterates its commitment to fighting gender-based  violence, including sexual violence.    Sexual violence is among the gravest violations  of human rights. Its impact ranges from immediate to  multiple long-term physical and mental consequences  for women and girls, men and boys. It also has very  negative consequences for their families, communities,  societies and countries as a whole. But it is not inevitable.  There are ways to prevent it. We fully support the  Secretary- General's recommendation in his latest report  (S/2018/250) to give due consideration to early-warning  signs of sexual violence when monitoring conflict  situations. If we fail to act early, the human, political  and economic costs can be devastating, as we know all  too well. That calls for a more alert, coordinated and  comprehensive approach by States Members and the  United Nations system.    It is crucial to support survivors of sexual violence  with adequate services so that they can rebuild their  lives. Survivors should also always be given the option  of documenting their cases for future accountability  processes. In that regard, the role of the International  Criminal Court (ICC) in ensuring the effective  investigation and prosecution of sexual and gender-  based crimes cannot be emphasized enough. The work  of UN-Women and Justice Rapid Response is also  important, since its joint expert roster has been an  effective tool for deploying experts to investigate and  document sexual violence in conflict-driven zones.  Estonia is fully committed to tackling gender-  based violence and has put in place a comprehensive  development strategy for the period from 2015 to 2020  for reducing violence domestically. It lays out concrete  activities for reducing and preventing violence in its  various forms, including sexual violence. Globally,  Estonia has been a strong supporter of Special  Representative Pramila Patten and her mandate. We  are also proud to be a consistent contributor to the ICC  Trust Fund for Victims, which alleviates suffering for  survivors of violence.    I would also like to emphasize the important role  of civil society. While intergovernmental cooperation  is extremely significant, we need to ensure that  everyone is heard. Civil-society and non-governmental  organizations, and women's organizations in particular,  can provide new insight and data that could otherwise  be missed. It is therefore very important to ensure that  non-governmental organizations have larger platforms  and more access to United Nations meetings and  forums. That would unquestionably help us to ensure  that every detail is accounted for in achieving our goals  related to ending conflict-related sexual violence.    Our experience has shown that national action plans  for implementing resolution 1325 (2000), on women and  peace and security, are essential in raising awareness  of the need for the inclusion of women in conflict  prevention and sustainable peacebuilding. Estonia is  currently implementing its second national action plan,  which was created and is being implemented jointly  with non-governmental organizations.    A fundamental lesson that we have learned from  experience and from the Secretary-General's reports  is the sheer level of detail that we have to deal with  in addressing sexual violence in conflict-driven zones.  Let us work together, domestically and globally, to put  an end to sexual violence forever."
