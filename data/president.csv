Mr. Krokhmal (Ukraine) Mr. President, my delegation warmly welcomes you as you preside over this meeting of the Security Council.  I should also like to thank you and the delegation of Namibia for organizing this open meeting and giving the Council an excellent opportunity to have a broad exchange of views and proposals aimed at finding effective ways to protect women and to ensure their full participation in efforts to maintain peace and security.  We thank the Secretary-General for his important statement this morning, as well as Ms. King, Assistant Secretary-General and Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, and Ms. Heyzer, Executive Director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), for their contribution to our discussion.  The question before us today is a complex one. It should also be borne in mind that a number of organs within the United Nations system are addressing various aspects of this issue, and a number of specific policies and recommendations in this respect have been worked out.  We would like to particularly commend the United Nations Development Fund for Women for its efforts to ensure that women are half of every solution. We would also like to underscore the important contribution of non-United Nations bodies and humanitarian agencies, as well as non-governmental organizations, in protecting women in armed conflicts and providing them humanitarian assistance and other necessary relief. The Security Council should provide its own perspective on the question of women's protection and women's role in the maintenance of peace and security, in accordance with its own mandate.  International resolve to safeguard women's rights in conflict situations has substantially strengthened in recent years. In response to the increased targeting of women and other civilians that has become a shameful instrument of contemporary warfare, the international community has further developed, in addition to the Fourth Geneva Convention and the two Additional Protocols of 1977, a body of law dealing with crimes against civilian populations, with special emphasis on the protection of women. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court incorporates gender-based prosecution within its jurisdiction and lists rape, enforced prostitution and other forms of sexual violence as war crimes and crimes against humanity. The ad hoc Tribunal for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia both explicitly incorporate rape as a crime against humanity within their jurisdiction. The statute of the Rwanda Tribunal also expressly includes rape, enforced prostitution and any form of indecent assault as a violation of article 3 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and a breach of Additional Protocol II. Apart from that, the Security Council has adopted several resolutions on the protection of children and civilians in armed conflict wherein it urged all parties to take special measures to protect women and girls from rape and other forms of gender-based violence.  However, in spite all international efforts, women continue to be the most vulnerable victims of armed conflicts. With a rapid proliferation of inter-State wars and other hostilities, civilians increasingly represent the overwhelming majority of war victims, with women and girls targeted for the most brutal forms of attack, including rape, sexual mutilation, sexually humiliating treatment and forcible impregnation. Sexual violence brings with it the risk of HIV/AIDS. The increase in inter-State and inter-ethnic hostilities in the last decade and the increased number of refugees became a catalyst for a major explosion in the spread of the disease, and it has yet to show up statistically. In addition to that, women also experience the trauma of losing relatives and friends in times of armed conflict and of having to take responsibility for the care of surviving family members. They also constitute the majority of refugees and displaced persons.  My country is greatly concerned about this situation and strongly condemns the targeting of women in situations of armed conflict. In this context, I would like to stress that the Security Council should give special consideration to the particular needs of women affected by armed conflict when considering action aimed at promoting peace and security.  It is important that the Secretary-General's reports to the Council dealing with specific conflict situations and developments in the field also incorporate gender perspectives in addressing various aspects of conflict analysis and conflict resolution. I share the view expressed by previous speakers that the Council should also request the Secretary-General to ensure that personnel involved in United Nations peacekeeping and peace-building operations have appropriate training on the protection, rights and particular needs of women. Security Council resolutions setting up or extending peacekeeping operations should provide a clear mandate to address the protection of women and girls affected by conflict against all sexual violence, abduction, enforced prostitution, trafficking and threats imposed by military, paramilitary and other groups.  We believe the Security Council has a special responsibility to support women's participation in peace processes by ensuring respective gender balance in United Nations peacekeeping missions. The Council has already recognized, through the statement of its President on the occasion of International Women's Day, the important role of women in conflict resolution, peacekeeping and peace-building and has underscored the importance of promoting an active and visible policy of mainstreaming a gender perspective into all policies and programmes when addressing armed or other conflicts.  My delegation heartily applauds the efforts and dedication of all women serving United Nations peacekeeping and humanitarian missions under very difficult and quite frequently dangerous circumstances in conflict and post-conflict areas. The presence of women in United Nations missions can foster confidence and trust among the local population, critical elements in any peacekeeping mission. In performing their tasks, women are perceived to be compassionate, unwilling to opt for force over reconciliation, willing to listen and learn and are widely seen as contributors to an environment of stability and morality that fosters the progress of peace.  At the same time, women are still under- represented in decision-making with regard to conflict. Their initiatives and visions for peace and security are rarely heard of during peace negotiations. In this regard, I would like to stress that women should not be viewed primarily as victims of armed conflict; the international community should use the potential of women as agents of preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping and peace-building. The peace-building initiatives of women in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia, Cambodia, Rwanda, Mozambique and Guatemala indicate how precious their contribution to peace can be. Being an active participant of the United Nations peacekeeping and peacemaking efforts, Ukraine has also contributed women civilian police to United Nations peacekeeping missions. We reiterate our readiness to continue working constructively with other Members States in order to ensure the protection of women in armed conflicts and women's participation in peace processes. We are confident that further development of peacekeeping and peace-building teams, with women and men as equal partners, would improve the efficiency of peacekeeping and peace maintenance throughout the world.  The delegation of Ukraine looks forward to a positive outcome of this important initiative on the women and peace and security. We hope that many useful ideas put forward by many delegations at this meeting will be incorporated in the respective Security Council draft resolution.

I shall now make a statement as the representative of Namibia, and on behalf of my Minister, who, due to other equally important engagements, is not able to be with us this morning.  Let me begin by expressing my hearty congratulations to the Secretary-General on his personal participation in this debate and his important statement. We are proud of him and fully support his leadership in this and other worthy endeavours.  The Secretary-General's Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, Ms. Angela King, made a constructive contribution in this meeting, and I thank her for her outstanding work. The preparations for the meeting would not have been successful without the cooperation and advice of the United Nations Fund for Women (UNIFEM). I thank Ms. Noeleen Heyzer, its Executive Director, for her dedication. The continuing efforts being made by UNIFEM. to assist women's peace activities at the grassroots level are greatly appreciated by all. These two distinguished United Nations officials have brought to the table unique perspectives, factual accounts and practical proposals for action. My thanks also go to all the agencies for their contributions and support.  This open debate is the first of its kind convened by the Council. It is a good omen that it is taking place on United Nations Day in the year 2000. Fifty-five years ago today the Charter of the United Nations came into being. Yet it has taken the international community many decades to recognize that women are among the principal victims of war, conflict and insecurity. They must thus be treated as indispensable partners in the maintenance of international peace and security. Today's meeting therefore constitutes a new and significant beginning for the Security Council; the Council should conscientiously make use of the contributions women can make in dealing with the issues of preventive diplomacy, conflict prevention, protection of women and girls in armed conflict and peace-making, peacekeeping and support operations.  The video images we all saw at the beginning of this meeting tell the full story and its implications. No one can deny the fact that women shoulder the heavy burden of sustaining embattled societies, while attending to traumas, miseries and violence during armed conflicts. Regrettably, peace negotiations are habitually male-dominated, the result being under- utilization of the capabilities of women in conflict prevention, resolution and settlement and a wilful disregard of their concerns.  Armed conflict affects women in special ways. Women demonstrate this time and again, but apparently to no avail. They are among the first civilians to become refugees or internally displaced persons. Nonetheless, they are the ones who are expected to look after children left in a state of despair and suffering. Women assume the responsibility of picking up the pieces, bringing together family life and promoting social harmony in the aftermath of war. However, there are no special measures aimed at assisting them during and after armed conflict. The impact of warfare and death on children requires purposeful attention, as do - to no less a degree - the related negative effects on women. In particular, as we are reviewing United Nations peace operations, we need to have a better understanding of the impact of conflict on women and girls in order to ensure adequate provision for their safety and protection.  As regards children, Security Council resolution 1261 (1999), adopted on 25 August 1999, among other things,  ""Urges States and all relevant parts of the United Nations system to intensify their efforts to ensure an end to the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict in violation of international law through political and other efforts, including promotion of the availability of alternatives for children to their participation in armed conflict"". (para. 13)  Doing that will lessen the burden of mothers and of other women. May I express here a word of gratitude to the Jamaican presidency during the month of July for pushing that heart-wrenching issue a step further into the limelight.  Never before has the necessity for equal participation by women at the peace table been felt more keenly than it is today. During the special session of the General Assembly to review the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action, this issue was repeatedly emphasized, and urgent calls were made for world peace and for an end to armed conflict and human suffering. Those cries for peace and human security still resonate. We must listen to women and engage them in the search for lasting solutions. Women have the right to participate in aspects of peace processes, peace negotiations and the implementation of agreements as well as in post-conflict monitoring, peace enforcement and reconstruction.  Gender-based violence against women and girls is widely recorded, and calls out for an international awareness campaign to put a complete end to it. Namibia welcomes the suggestion that the United Nations maintain an open roster of qualified women for recruitment and deployment in key positions in the system. Women constitute half of the population, and possess half of the world's brain-power and experience. For this to begin to happen, mindsets, especially those of men, must change and must give way to new thinking and to a new beginning for the United Nations in the field of conflict resolution and peacekeeping. Now is the time to move away from perceiving women only as victims of conflict and to see them also, and more importantly, as equal participants in securing peace and security in the world.  In conflict situations, violence against women, including rape, is used as a weapon of war in unconscionable violation of women's human rights and dignity. It is timely and imperative that the full force of international humanitarian and human rights law be applied effectively against all culprits.  Namibia supports the strengthening of the capacity of women to participate in all United Nations peace operations and to participate fully in decision- making at all levels. Women should continue to be involved in greater numbers in ongoing efforts to promote peace and to resolve conflicts, including through the appointment of qualified African women as special envoys and representatives of the Secretaries- General of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). In that regard, Namibia welcomes the contribution made by the OAU's African Women's Committee on Peace and Development. Efforts should be made to enhance further cooperation with it. We are convinced that if and when a gender unit is established in the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations, a fruitful link with the African Women's Committee will be established.  The mandates of peace missions, peacekeeping operations and peace-building activities need to have provisions on the protection of women. Also, women should take on high-level roles in field-based civilian peace and security operations at senior decision- making and management levels. A good beginning has been made, which we welcome, concerning a gender unit in the peacekeeping missions in Kosovo and in East Timor. We encourage the Secretary-General to establish similar units in other peacekeeping missions. To date, the Security Council has dispatched successful fact-finding missions to several conflict areas. In our view, a senior gender expert should be included in such missions, so that the Council can gain a full appreciation of the gender dimension of ongoing or potential conflicts.  Just last month, world leaders, at the Millennium Summit, commended the report (S/2000/809) of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations chaired by Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, and called for its early consideration and for the early implementation of its relevant recommendations. Like other countries represented here, Namibia laments the Brahimi report's lack of clear and categorical emphasis on gender perspectives and on an effective role for women in conflict resolution, peacekeeping and peace-building. That unfortunate situation and other shortcomings should be rectified during the implementation process.  In that context, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations organized a timely and successful seminar, held from 29 to 31 May 2000 at Windhoek, Namibia. Its theme was mainstreaming a gender perspective in multidimensional peace support operations. The Namibian Government and the people of Namibia were immensely honoured to have hosted that seminar and offered all possible support to ensure its success. The Namibia Plan of Action, inter alia, recommended that  ""Lessons learned from current and prior missions on gender should be incorporated at the planning stage of a new mission"" (S/2000/693, annex 11, para. 4)  and that ""The current format of reporting, particularly with regard to situation reports and periodic reports of the Secretary-General, should include progress on gender mainstreaming throughout peacekeeping missions"". (para. 8)  Namibia fully endorses the Plan of Action and urges all concerned to take its proposals into account when formulating policy objectives and implementation plans in respect of the Brahimi report.  In his previous capacity in another principal organ of the United Nations, my Minister for Foreign Affairs had numerous opportunities to address many topical social and humanitarian issues, particularly during the three key special sessions of the General Assembly, relating respectively to small island developing States, to Beijing+5 and to Copenhagen+5. Also, as a follow-up to the Secretary-General's 1998 report on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa (S/1998/318), we established a working group to monitor the implementation process. We have had the first report of that working group, so ably prepared by the Permanent Representatives of Singapore and of Spain, whom I heartily thank once again for their excellent work and their dedication.  It was pointed out that peace, security and social development are unceasingly and without exception being undermined in one way or another by the easy availability of small arms and light weapons. We are now all agreed about the devastating effects of these deadly weapons on civilian populations in Africa and in other developing countries.  I know that this pressing issue will be dealt with in a coordinated manner in the near future in Mali. Needless to say, this type of weaponry clearly contributes to prolonging armed conflict and imposes severe hardships, especially on women and children. By the same token, the process of disarmament, demobilization, resettlement and rehabilitation of ex- combatants should take into account the special needs of women and girls.  Landmine-awareness campaigns and demining activities cannot ignore the concerns and interests of the real victims, namely women and children. As I said elsewhere, women are not really begging for favours; they are actually demanding their legitimate rights and opportunities to contribute to peace, development and prosperity.  The views expressed today indicate that the maintenance of peace and security is a collective effort. It should therefore involve all women and men for our common good. To that end, let us put our words into deeds to make this, our one world, a peaceful and secure place for this and future generations.  I now resume my functions as President of the Council.  There are no further speakers inscribed on my list for this meeting. The next meeting of the Security Council to continue the consideration of the item on the agenda will be fixed in consultation with the members of the Security Council.  The meeting rose at 12.15 pm.

Allow me to begin by saying a few words about the format for the meeting. I shall shortly be inviting Under-Secretary-General Guehenno, Assistant- Secretary Angela King, and the Director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) Noeleen Heyzer, to talk to us for a few minutes about their work in this field. I will then invite Member States to comment and ask questions, and I propose to give the floor to three Council members, then three non-Council members, or according to the numbers, perhaps two non-Council members, until I reach the end of the speaker's list. I shall also invite our panel to respond to points raised at appropriate moments throughout the debate. I shall wind up the meeting with a short summary.  We circulated a note a few days ago setting out the objectives for this meeting and giving a few details about the format we will be following. Spare copies are available in the room. I shall also like to inform members that in my capacity as Council President I held a meeting earlier this week with representatives of the non-governmental organizations (NGO) Working Group on Women, Peace and Security, at which I invited them to raise issues of importance to their organizations that are relevant to today's discussion. I can say that that exchange that I had with that working group was very informative. These groups have done an enormous amount of work on the mainstreaming agenda, on the issue of women and families in areas of conflict. We circulated a short note outlining the main points raised at that meeting, and there is also literature from some of these NGOs available for Member States on the table immediately outside this room. I recommend that you pick up that literature, because some of it is very interesting on work in this field.  I would now like to give the floor to the Under- Secretary-General for Peacekeeping, Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno.   ",The President,,English,u," I should like to inform the Council that I have received letters from the representatives of Australia, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Grenada, Jamaica, Japan, Liechtenstein, New Zealand, Nigeria and the Republic of Korea, in which they request to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In accordance with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite those representatives to participate in the discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.  There being no objection, it is so decided.  At the invitation of the President, Mr. Stuart (Australia), MnHeinbecker (Canada), Mr. Maquieira (Chile), Ms. Loj (Denmark), Mr. Stanislaus (Grenada), Miss Durrant (Jamaica), Mr. Motomura (Japan), Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein), Mr. McIvor (New Zealand), Mrs. Yahaya (Nigeria) and Mr. Sun Joun- Yung (Republic of Korea) took the seats reserved for them at the side of the Council Chamber.  The President: In accordance with the understanding reached in the Council's prior consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno, Under- Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations.  It is so decided.  I invite Mr. Guehenno to take a seat at the Council table.   The President: In accordance with the understanding reached in the Council's prior consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to Ms. Angela King, Assistant Secretary- General and Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women.  It is so decided. I invite Ms. King to take a seat at the Council table.   The President: In accordance with the understanding reached in the Council's prior consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to Ms. Noeleen Heyzer, Executive Director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women.  It is so decided.  I invite Ms. Heyzer to take a seat at the Council table.   The President: The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.

I should like to make a few points in my capacity as representative of the United Kingdom, while subscribing also to the statement made by Denmark earlier on behalf of the European Union.  I think that the three presentations that started off our debate today have given us a huge amount of stimulation, followed by a useful and very thought- provoking debate covering a wide range of issues relating to women and conflict and peacekeeping.  Conflict has changed, and so we must change. The United Kingdom recognizes the enormous value of resolution 1325 (2000) and related gender initiatives in raising the profile of gender as an issue of real relevance to conflict resolution, peacekeeping and peace-building.  But we are concerned here today with implementation. Rather like Australia, I do not believe that the Council needs more norm-setting in this area. We need implementation.  We felt that there were two fundamental reasons for holding this debate with the objective of building on resolution 1325 (2000) and not just reiterating it.  The first was to raise the probability that impunity will be denied to, and good practice will deter, those who commit or plan to commit violence against women in an area of conflict. The adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) is, I think, illustrative and only a starting point in that area.  The second reason for this debate was to recognize and to reflect in peacekeeping practice the huge contribution which women can make to conflict prevention and negotiation and to post-conflict peace- building. I pay tribute to the United Nations as a whole for the progress it has made to date in mainstreaming gender throughout the Organization.  For example, we welcome recent indications from the Department of Peacekeeping Operations' Lessons Learned Unit that the presence of women in peacekeeping operations has improved the effectiveness of those missions by improving the levels of access to the local population and increasing the range of skills, approaches and perspectives in missions.  We welcome this progress so far, but we have to recognize it for what it is - merely the start of a much wider effort. Every part of the United Nations system that engages with the broad range of issues in the resolution, from conflict prevention to post-conflict peace-building - including the Department of Political Affairs, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the funds and programmes - must give appropriate attention to gender perspectives.  It is now readily accepted that gender mainstreaming is a crucial strategy in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Effective management of conflict, especially its prevention is, alongside that, an aspect of the Goals' focus. Integrating gender perspectives into conflict prevention work will make the impact of that work all the more effective.  It is therefore important that Member States throughout all United Nations bodies express their political commitment to, and offer direction and guidance on, gender mainstreaming. We have seen some excellent examples of this during the recent substantive session of the Economic and Social Council, with its first consideration of gender mainstreaming under a dedicated agenda sub-item. And may I congratulate the Economic and Social Council on having adopted yesterday a resolution that takes forward gender mainstreaming in that Council and its subsidiary bodies. It is good to see the Councils match each other in these respects. The Security Council should aim, as the Economic and Social Council has done in its resolution, to identify best practice and encourage its promulgation. I also commend the important and valuable contribution made by non-governmental organizations in this field, both in their cooperation with the United Nations and Member States and in their independent and often very courageous activities in conflict zones.  We all know that much remains to be done. We have hardly scratched the surface of the real problems on the ground in conflict areas. We hope that this meeting will help sustain and build on the momentum created by resolution 1325 (2000) and provide for further progress in this field through the ideas presented in this debate, in the response of the Secretariat and in that of the relevant agencies and Governments to those ideas.

UNSC_2002_SPV.4589Resumption1_spch020.txt,2002,4589,"The President: I thank Ms. Heyzer very much for those final remarks and for her enthusiastic participation with us today in an important event for the whole gender issue.  Let me sum up briefly some points we will put in writing as a consequence of this debate, on the responsibility of the presidency.  I think it has been a rich and timely debate and I hope it will assist the Secretariat in the preparation of the Secretary-General's report, which we look forward to in October. There is a great deal there, much of which you already thought of. But in order to get the Security Council on board, this is an important set of guidance for you. I warmly thank all those who participated, especially those who did not just come today to make a national statement, but to interact with other speakers, pick up ideas and move them forward.  The salient points I think we should bear as a Security Council emerge as the following.  First, there is a need to ensure the integration of gender perspective throughout the United Nations, both in the field and at Headquarters. Second is a need to ensure that all peacekeeping mandates, peace agreements and informal understandings include a relevant gender perspective. Third is the importance of involving women at all stages and all levels in peacekeeping operations, peace processes, humanitarian operations and post-conflict reconstruction. Liechtenstein brought out most clearly the message that participation in itself is a very important part of addressing gender.  Fourthly, there is the importance of gender training for United Nations peacekeeping personnel. The European Union statement pointed to the revision of existing guidelines and standard operating procedures, but there is a DPKO manual which addresses these points which should be kept up to date, implemented and therefore read and understood by all those take part in peacekeeping operations. Fifth - I think all those who mentioned it were unanimous - is the importance of the appointment of a senior gender adviser in DPKO. Norway, the Russian Federation and many others pointed to this.  Sixthly, we must ensure that women are fully included in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programmes. We have not yet sufficiently sorted out DDR in the Council, and there is a gender element to that which is very important. Seventh, we need to ensure that all peacekeeping operations include professional gender advisers and that they consult with community leaders, local NGOs, and wider sections of the community, including experienced women peacemakers and women's groups. In that context Canada made an important point. When SRSGs and representatives of peacekeeping operations come to the Council, they should be addressed and questioned on the area of gender perspective in their operations. As Canada said, specificity is credibility. That is an important message.  Next, there is the desirability of drawing up codes of conduct governing the behaviour of peacekeeping personnel, including provisions to ensure the safety and dignity of women and girls. Additionally, the desirability, in itself, of more female SRSGs, and then the potential usefulness of the establishment in the Secretariat of a centralized database of gender specialists and experienced women peacemakers. This is not mentioned often, but I think we should pick up on that. Perhaps the Secretariat could think about it further. Nobody mentioned Security Council missions, but we do meet with gender groups when we go on missions, and I think that should be a natural part of a mission, to ensure that gender issues are fully taken into consideration.  Finally, do not forget that regional organizations can play their own role in all of this. Nigeria mentioned ECOWAS specifically in this respect, and ECOWAS has thought about this. But I think all regional organizations in the peacekeeping and peace and security context should be aware of the need for a gender perspective.  My final word is on men. If, in the Security Council's perception, it were the case that men were the victims of bad treatment because of their gender, then we would take up their issue. This is not a discriminatory exercise. It is because women are Victims because of their gender that we are taking up this issue in the context of conflict. If men deserve the same treatment, they will get it from the Security Council.  We will, as I mentioned, issue a note to sum up where I think we got to in this debate.  I understand the representative of Syria would like to make some final remarks.  ",The President,,English,u," I thank Ms. Heyzer very much for those final remarks and for her enthusiastic participation with us today in an important event for the whole gender issue.

This is not mentioned often, but I think we should pick up on that. Perhaps the Secretariat could think about it further. Nobody mentioned Security Council missions, but we do meet with gender groups when we go on missions, and I think that should be a natural part of a mission, to ensure that gender issues are fully taken into consideration.  Finally, do not forget that regional organizations can play their own role in all of this. Nigeria mentioned ECOWAS specifically in this respect, and ECOWAS has thought about this. But I think all regional organizations in the peacekeeping and peace and security context should be aware of the need for a gender perspective.  My final word is on men. If, in the Security Council's perception, it were the case that men were the victims of bad treatment because of their gender, then we would take up their issue. This is not a discriminatory exercise. It is because women are Victims because of their gender that we are taking up this issue in the context of conflict. If men deserve the same treatment, they will get it from the Security Council.  We will, as I mentioned, issue a note to sum up where I think we got to in this debate.  I understand the representative of Syria would like to make some final remarks.  "

UNSC_2002_SPV.4635_spch017.txt,2002,4635,"The President (spoke in French): I will now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Cameroon.  I wish to first thank the Secretary-General, who came this afternoon to personally introduce his report on the impact of armed conflict on women and girls, as well as on the role of women in peace-building. In doing this, he confirmed, if that were necessary, his firm commitment and determination to help eradicate the causes of conflicts and their consequences for the most vulnerable civilian populations, particularly women and children.  I also wish to pay a well deserved tribute to Ms. Angela King, Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, and to Ms. Noeleen Heyzer, Director of UNIFEM, for their major contribution to the preparation of this instructive and thorough report. In addition, I would like to pay tribute to Ms. Carolyn Hannan, who is present with us at this discussion. The Beijing Declaration and Plan of Action quite correctly underscored that the consequences of armed conflicts and other conflicts were among the major concerns for women in today's world. The Security Council reaffirmed the role of women in the peace processes at the celebration of International Women's Day on 8 March 2000. It was along these lines that for the first time it devoted its work to the consideration of the question of women, peace and security. In doing so, it clearly highlighted the specific situation of women and girls in the context of the protection of civilians in armed conflicts.  On 31 October 2000, the Council unanimously adopted resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security. The goal of that resolution was, and remains, to ensure that women and girls in conflict situations are protected and that those committing acts of violence against them in conflict situations are prosecuted, and that women may, on equal footing, occupy their proper place when it comes to taking decisions on questions of peace and security.  The Government of Cameroon fully endorses this important objective, which is fully in line with the efforts it has made on the national level to provide protection for women and girls in situations of armed conflict. I note here that this dynamic programme for the advancement of women in a broad range of activities associated with peace and security is backed by a collection of normative texts. Cameroon has acceded to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions, which deal with the protection of victims of war and of women and girls in situations of armed conflict, and to most instruments relating to human rights. It is also a signatory of the statute that created the International Criminal Court and is preparing to ratify it.  We are therefore genuinely pleased to welcome the report of the Secretary-General in document S/2002/ 1154. The recommendations therein take stock of the strategies to be implemented to promote partnership between women and men in order to enhance the effectiveness of the multidimensional peacekeeping operations.  Cameroon and the Central African region have played an active part in the preparation of the proposals in this report. On the initiative of UNIFEM, and in conjunction with the United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa, a regional consultation on the topic ""Parity and Development: participation of women in Central Africa"" was held in Douala from 22 to 30 May 2002. It provided an opportunity for regional actors, women and civil society in particular, to make forceful suggestion about ways and means of promoting implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000).  The work done at Douala resulted in the adoption of a regional plan of action for which follow-up will be provided by a group comprised of representatives of Governments and civil society. That plan of action identifies a set of problems that underlie conflicts in the region and their consequences for women, consequences associated with, among other things, their marginalization, the unlawful circulation of weapons, and failure to comply with relevant national and international legal instruments.  The Douala plan of action advocates a number of measures that if implemented would significantly improve the situation of women vis-a-vis peace and security. It proposes, among other things, that consciousness-raising campaigns be organized to combat impunity; that the networks of Central African women be reactivated in order to engage in activities to promote peace in the countries of the sub-region; that a study be carried out on traditional conflict management practices; that the weapons-for-development programme be implemented; that a dialogue be organized with men in uniform and militia personnel; and that peaceful demonstrations be organized in favour of peace and security.  Before I conclude, I wish to commend the Arria- formula meeting of 23 October 2002 on the question of women, peace and security, which made it possible to hear some particularly moving testimony concerning the situation actually experienced in the field by some of the participants. That meeting was also an opportunity for us to engage in a profound process of thinking along with civil society about ways of enhancing the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  The role played by women in conflict prevention, in encouraging reconciliation and helping to rebuild what, alas, is destroyed by conflicts has been very clearly described. The Arria-formula meeting, skillfully chaired by Minister Lee, produced a number of recommendations relating, among other things, to the incorporation of gender specific measures in the mandates of peacekeeping missions, and the real participation of women in peace negotiations. All of these measures converged to a great extent with those presented in the report of the Secretary-General which my delegation supports unreservedly. I am convinced that were these measures to be implemented, they would lead to genuine advancement for women and greater appreciation of their role, and thus, to their full and complete involvement in the promotion of peace and security.

It is so decided.  I invite Ms. Smythe to take a seat at the Council table.  The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.  I should like to welcome members of the Council, our visiting speakers and our guests. I have already acknowledged the presence of the Minister for Development Cooperation of the Netherlands, Ms. Agnes van Ardenne. I should like also to welcome Ms. Angela King and Ms. Noeleen Heyzer to this debate on conflict, peacekeeping and gender. I hope that we will have a useful discussion on this very important topic. I am especially pleased that in today's discussion we will have a unique perspective, in addition to that provided by Under-Secretary-General Guehenno, who will speak more broadly about the progress that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations has made towards implementation. We will also hear directly from the Senior Gender Adviser to MONUC, who is mandated to work on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) in the field.  Please allow me to begin by saying a few words about the format for the meeting. I will shortly be inviting Mr. Guehenno and Ms. Smythe to talk to us for a few minutes about their work in implementing resolution 1325 (2000). I will then invite the 15 member States of the Security Council to comment and ask questions. I then propose to invite our guest speakers to respond to points raised thus far. We will then give the floor to those non-Council members inscribed on the speakers' list and conclude by once more offering Mr. Guehenno and Ms. Smythe an opportunity to respond to comments made and questions raised by Member States.  In the interests of time, we would suggest that Member States try to limit their presentations to five minutes. At the conclusion of today's meeting, the presidency will prepare a summary, on its own authority, of the main points of this meeting, which will be issued as a press statement. Of course, the record of the Council meeting itself will also be available for anyone to refer to after the fact.  I should like to make one additional procedural point. The Secretary-General is having his annual meeting of the heads of the principal organs of the United Nations at 12.30 this afternoon, which I have been invited to attend in my capacity as President of the Security Council. Ambassador Cunningham will then conduct the meeting until 1.15 pm. If it is necessary that we meet in the afternoon, we will break until 3 p.m., at which time we will hear the remaining speakers on the list.  I now give the floor to the Under-Secretary- General for Peacekeeping, Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno.   ",The President,,English,u," I should like to inform the Council that I have received letters from the representatives of Australia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Canada, Colombia, Croatia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Fiji, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, South Africa, Timor-Leste, Ukraine and the United Republic of Tanzania in which they request to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite those representatives to participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.  There being no objection, it is so decided.  At the invitation of the President, the representatives of the aforementioned countries took the seats reserved for them at the side of the Council Chamber.  The President: On behalf of the Security Council, I extend a warm welcome to Her Excellency Ms. Agnes van Ardenne, Minister for Development and Cooperation of the Netherlands.  Likewise, on behalf of the Council, I extend a warm welcome to His Excellency Mr. Kaliopate Tavola, Minister for Foreign Affairs and External Trade of Fiji.  In accordance with the understanding reached in the Council's prior consultations, and in the absence of objection, I shall take it that the Security Council agrees to extend an invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno, Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations.

UNSC_2003_SPV.4852Resumption1_spch040.txt,2003,4852,"The President: I would now like to offer a statement in my national capacity.  The United States vigorously supported the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and we continue to pursue its goals, particularly through the Group of Friends of resolution 1325 (2000), so ably energized by the Canadian delegation. We therefore scheduled today's meeting to take stock of progress made to see what can be done to continue to advance implementation and to provide an operational perspective on implementation. The two presentations that started off today's discussion provided us with valuable information, followed by a useful and thought-provoking debate. I thank Mr. Guehenno and Ms. Smythe for joining us today. We heartily commend the efforts of the Secretariat, the Gender Advisers, Member States, civil society and others on their insight and accomplishments. But we clearly have work to do before we can say that Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) has been fully implemented. I address this point to everyone - the members of the Security Council, other Member States, parties to conflict and, of course, every department and office in the Secretariat.  Although we called upon the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to provide today's report, we have not forgotten about the responsibilities and contributions of other United Nations departments, including the Department of Political Affairs, the Department for Disarmament Affairs, the Office of the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, and the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), among others. For our part, we in the Security Council, where appropriate, include references to gender and resolution 1325 (2000) in our resolutions, mission mandates and reports - although there have been comments throughout the day that perhaps we do not do that sufficiently.  My Government's support for resolution 1325 (2000) and the principles it embodies are part of a larger United States commitment to advancing the rights of women more broadly at home and around the world. We envision a world in which participation in all aspects of civic life by both men and women is free and whole.  With respect to the focus of resolution 1325 (2000), it is literally impossible to understand conflicts and then frame and implement policy responses to those conflicts without overcoming the inertia that too often sidelines, sidetracks and silences half of the world's population. No approach to peace can succeed if it does not view men and women as equally important components of the solution.  The United States, therefore, is placing great emphasis on the role of women in resolving conflicts and building peace in countries that desperately need their vision and full participation. That is why we are investing heavily in bringing women into the equation in post-conflict areas where their voices have been muted. For example, the Office of the Senior Coordinator for International Women's Issues in the United States Department of State lists nearly 175 projects dedicated to women's political, economic and social development in Afghanistan. These include a $2.5 million grant to build women's resource centres in 14 provinces, as well as an additional $1 million for educational and training programmes on topics ranging from employment to human rights education and political participation skills; grants to support women's political participation and potential female candidates in various Afghan provinces, and an advocacy training programme held in the United States for Afghan women political activists in preparation for the Loya Jirga. We look forward to the Council's upcoming trip to Afghanistan as an opportunity to see first-hand what kind of progress women in Afghanistan have made and to continue to urge their involvement in the post- conflict reconstruction of their country. I am pleased to have heard Minister of State Muller confirm Germany's commitment to that aspect of the Council's visit.  In Iraq, we are promoting women's inclusion in the building of civil society. The Coalition Provisional Authority governance team has in fact held dozens of meetings with Iraqi women on a range of issues, including constitutional and legal reform, security, human rights and education and health, among others. In May, the Authority Administrator, Ambassador Bremer, personally met with Iraqi women representing a range of backgrounds to discuss the future of Iraq. He encouraged them to form a steering committee, and as a result, on 9 July more than 70 women - experts in law, education, health, human rights and economics - participated in a day of workshops entitled ""The voice of women in Iraq"". United States Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky gave the keynote address and delivered a personal message from President Bush, who commended the women attending the conference for ""their strong commitment to creating an Iraq where the benefits of freedom are available to all citizens"". Representatives from the United Nations and United Nations agencies - including the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Children's Fund and UNIFEM, which do such important work on these issues - also participated and contributed.  There is remarkable work being done at the United-States-supported Fatima al-Zahra Centre for Women's Rights in Hillah, where another important meeting, entitled ""The heartland of Iraq's women's conference"", took place just this month. More than 150 women attended from the five south-central provinces, including women involved in the establishment of women's centres and organizations in their communities. In addition, we are working to strengthen community-based groups in Iraq to foster citizen participation in the local policy-making process. In that regard, our funding for women's organizations has helped them build their capacity to promote women's issues at interim advisory councils across Iraq and to organize workshops for Iraqi women to discuss reforms in such areas as matrimonial law, the prevention of violence, abuse against women and equal opportunities in education and employment. Reinforcing those efforts, the Coalition Provisional Authority and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) are cooperating with the Baghdad District Advisory Council women's committee, the Baghdad Women's Non-Governmental Organization Coordinating Council and Women for Women International to conduct on-site assessments for the establishment of nine women's training and education centres across the city.  As Ms. Smythe noted, women are among the most disadvantaged members of the population of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, another strife-torn nation. To help women in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we have funded programmes through the International Human Rights Law Group to support local organizations attempting to end sexual violence against women. USAID has also granted $500,000 to the International Rescue Committee for a programme to counsel women and help them deal with the consequences of rape in North and South Kivu.  Those are but a few examples of our programmatic emphasis on implementing resolution 1325 (2000) in letter and spirit. As a further manifestation of our resolve, shared by many of the countries present here today, the United States has sponsored a draft resolution on women and political participation during the current session of the General Assembly. Our draft resolution outlines a series of practical steps that States and other actors can and should take to increase women's participation in politics and decision-making. It also specifically mentions resolution 1325 (2000) and urges States and the United Nations to increase women's participation in conflict resolution and peace processes.  I would also like to draw attention to another issue that has a significant impact on women, particularly in conflict situations. We know that each year hundreds of thousands of women and children fall victim to the sex trade. As President Bush said to the General Assembly last month, ""Nearly two centuries after the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade and more than a century after slavery was officially ended in its last strongholds, the trade in human beings for any purpose must not be allowed to thrive in our time."" (A/58/PV.7, p. 12)  The United States Government has therefore committed $50 million to support organizations that are rescuing women and children from exploitation and giving them the hope of a new life. In this regard, I would especially like to thank Under-Secretary- General Guehenno for his update on the current response of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to trafficking in women as it affects peacekeeping operations, and note that we look forward to the lessons-learned study that he has under way. We join others in expressing our pleasure at hearing that the Department intends soon to fill the Gender Adviser position at Headquarters.  I conclude by saying that, while we have made progress, there is indeed much more work to be done. I echo many of the questions that my colleagues have raised. My Government and my Mission will continue to support and push for the implementation of the landmark resolution.  I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.  Because of the press of other business, Under- Secretary-General Guehenno was unable to be with us this afternoon. I therefore propose that the presidency of the Council undertake to comb through some of the questions that were addressed to him during the course of this afternoon's discussion, ensure that they reach his Office and ask for those replies that he can provide at this particular time. In any event, I am sure that such questions will serve as a guide to his Office and to others with regard to the concerns expressed here this afternoon by Member States.  Since Ms. Smythe has been with us this afternoon, listening patiently throughout the debate, I would now like to ask her if she has any additional comments to make or if she would like to undertake to reply to any of the questions that have been asked this afternoon.  ",The President,,English,u," I would now like to offer a statement in my national capacity.

It also specifically mentions resolution 1325 (2000) and urges States and the United Nations to increase women's participation in conflict resolution and peace processes.  I would also like to draw attention to another issue that has a significant impact on women, particularly in conflict situations. We know that each year hundreds of thousands of women and children fall victim to the sex trade. As President Bush said to the General Assembly last month, ""Nearly two centuries after the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade and more than a century after slavery was officially ended in its last strongholds, the trade in human beings for any purpose must not be allowed to thrive in our time."" (A/58/PV.7, p. 12)  The United States Government has therefore committed $50 million to support organizations that are rescuing women and children from exploitation and giving them the hope of a new life. In this regard, I would especially like to thank Under-Secretary- General Guehenno for his update on the current response of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to trafficking in women as it affects peacekeeping operations, and note that we look forward to the lessons-learned study that he has under way. We join others in expressing our pleasure at hearing that the Department intends soon to fill the Gender Adviser position at Headquarters.  I conclude by saying that, while we have made progress, there is indeed much more work to be done. I echo many of the questions that my colleagues have raised. My Government and my Mission will continue to support and push for the implementation of the landmark resolution.  I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.  Because of the press of other business, Under- Secretary-General Guehenno was unable to be with us this afternoon. I therefore propose that the presidency of the Council undertake to comb through some of the questions that were addressed to him during the course of this afternoon's discussion, ensure that they reach his Office and ask for those replies that he can provide at this particular time. In any event, I am sure that such questions will serve as a guide to his Office and to others with regard to the concerns expressed here this afternoon by Member States.  Since Ms. Smythe has been with us this afternoon, listening patiently throughout the debate, I would now like to ask her if she has any additional comments to make or if she would like to undertake to reply to any of the questions that have been asked this afternoon.

At this morning's meeting, the Council will hear briefings by Mr. Guehenno, Ms. Arbour and Ms. Obaid, and this afternoon, by Ms. Rwankuba and Ms. Heyzer.  It is very good to see so many distinguished guests and speakers, a visible demonstration of the support of the United Nations system, as a whole, for Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). That resolution marked a turning point in the work of the Security Council. For the first time, the Council looked beyond the political and the military dimensions of peace and security and specifically addressed the rights of those most affected by conflict.  Crucially, the resolution not only recognized the disproportionate affect of conflict on women, but it also underlined the essential contribution that they make to prevent conflict and maintain peace. Resolution 1325 (2000) tasked the United Nations system and its Member States to ensure that gender considerations are thoroughly integrated into all aspects of United Nations peace and security work, from conflict prevention to post-conflict reconstruction.  In addition to the increased participation of women, resolution 1325 (2000) also addresses the very urgent need of providing protection to women in conflict situations because, as we all know, it is women and children who suffer disproportionately in armed conflict and constitute the majority of all victims.  There has been growing international recognition in recent years of gender-based violence in conflict situations. Incidents of such violence continue at a frightening rate. As we start this debate, I can do no better than note what the Secretary-General said in his wake-up address to the African Union when gender was discussed in Addis Ababa on 6 July this year. Mr. Kofi Annan said on that occasion,  ""In parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo and in the Darfur region of the Sudan, gender- based violence has reached almost epidemic proportions. Every effort must be made to halt this odious practice and bring the perpetrators to justice.""  Who can quarrel with those words?

UNSC_2004_SPV.5066_spch023.txt,2004,5066,"The President: I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of the United Kingdom.  I associate myself with the remarks to be delivered subsequently by the representative of the Netherlands on behalf of the European Union and I extend my thanks to all those who are participating in today's meeting.  Much of today's meeting has looked at how the United Nations can better ensure sustainable peace by strengthening efforts to further the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). There is more the Council must do, too, along with the wider United Nations membership here in New York, but crucially, resolution 1325 (2000) must also be implemented at the national level by all United Nations Member States if it is to be fully effective. The United Kingdom is therefore currently examining how it can best use the opportunity of our presidencies of the G-8 and the European Union next year to ensure wider implementation of that key resolution.  In London, we are currently developing a Government-wide action plan for our implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), linking development, humanitarian, defence and diplomacy work. The United Kingdom Ministry of Defence has recently launched action across the armed services to ensure that the provisions of resolution 1325 (2000) are implemented systematically in the Ministry's planning, doctrine and training programmes. The Department of International Development is acting similarly and developing case studies of Iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo, Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  But efforts at the national level have to be complemented by action overseas. Thus, in Afghanistan, the United Kingdom worked to get Afghan women to take up their rightful role in the recent elections, in voter registration and as campaigners and officials, and to take up their quotas for representation in Parliament. I think we can all be pleased that, in Afghanistan, women represented over 40 per cent of the voter turnout recently.  In June, the United Kingdom organized a training seminar in Cairo to assist Iraqi women in developing their positive participation. We have also held workshops in Baghdad and in Basra that have helped women on the role of democracy and democratic values, thus combining women's rights with long-term conflict prevention.  The United Kingdom is funding a local project to empower Arab women with leadership skills in order to provide active role models to encourage women to become future election candidates. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we are working closely with partners to develop action plans to ensure women's full participation in the election as voters, potential leaders, civic educators and election observers, as well as contributors to the ongoing peace and transition process in their country. In East Timor, we are funding training workshops for election candidates and helping the civil police integrate gender perspectives into their work.  Equally important, however, is to recognize that, to support the role that civil society can play is absolutely crucial in the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). That is why the United Kingdom is cooperating with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in many areas and in many theatres of conflict. Civil society has played a key role in driving forward the implementation of that resolution through advocacy, training and awareness-raising. I would like to commend the civil society representatives here today for their dedication and for their work in holding the United Nations, and the Security Council in particular, to account for its actions on resolution 1325 (2000). Their contribution to this process is vital.  I would also like to thank Ms. Agathe Rwankuba for travelling from the Democratic Republic of the Congo in order to be able to talk to us today. It is important that the voices of civil society are heard in the Council, because it is often the NGO community that really bears witness at the heart of conflict situations.  Resolution 1325 (2000) explicitly calls on all parties to armed conflict to take special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence. It emphasizes that it is the responsibility of all States to put an end to impunity and to prosecute those responsible for war crimes, including those crimes related to sexual and other violence against women and girls. The Council must assume responsibility for enforcing those provisions of the resolution. That means ensuring that those aspects are fully included in the resolutions that set up peacekeeping operations, and that they are mainstreamed into the work of all members of the United Nations family in the field. We, the United Nations system and Member States, must all work harder to implement resolution 1325 (2000). I hope today's meeting will spur us all on to face the challenges.  But we also have to recognize our responsibility to improve the situation faced by women in post- conflict situations. Suffering from sexual violence does not end with the signing of a peace accord. We know that we must, on the one hand, do more to prevent women from becoming victims of conflict; but we also have to ensure that women are not also victims of the post-conflict situation. Conflict or the social and economic uncertainties of the post-conflict environment often force women into prostitution or sexual slavery as the only means to survive or to support themselves and their families.  Our obligation is clear: we have to create a post- conflict environment that offers hope. Women must be full and equal participants in the building of peace - in the development of post-conflict legislative, judicial and constitutional structures - because that is the only way that those structures will be fully representative of the post-conflict society, and therefore fully able to  meet the needs and demands of all. That is sustainable peace.  We must never allow the sexual exploitation and abuse of women in any circumstances in post-conflict situations, regardless of who is responsible for the exploitation and the abuse. We have to be very clear on that. United Nations personnel are our representatives on the ground. They embody our determination to bring peace, security, justice and equality. If they, of all people, abuse their position of trust, they are also abusing the will of the international community.  The United Kingdom hopes that the adoption of the presidential statement by the Council today will be the first step in addressing the challenges identified in the Secretary-General's report. When we next review progress, we need to demonstrate that we have made real improvements in implementation. The truth is that, if we want to do justice to peace, then we have to do justice to resolution 1325 (2000).  I now resume my functions as President of the Council. In order to optimize the use of our time, I will not individually invite speakers to take their seats at the Council table. But when a speaker is taking the floor, the Conference Officer will seat the next speaker on the list at the table, in readiness to address the Council. I thank participants in advance for their cooperation in that regard.  I would now like to call on the representative of Canada.

There are no speakers remaining on my list.  After consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:  ""The Security Council reaffirms its commitment to the continuing and full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and welcomes the increasing focus on the situation of women and girls in armed conflict since the adoption of that resolution in October 2000. The Council recalls the statement by its President of 31 October 2002 and the meeting held on 29 October 2003 as valuable demonstrations of that commitment.  ""The Security Council also recalls the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (A/52/231) and the outcome document of the twenty-third special session of the United Nations General Assembly entitled 'Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty- first century' (A/S-23/10/Rev.1), in particular the commitments concerning women and armed conflict.  ""The Security Council welcomes the Report of the Secretary-General on women and peace and security (S/2004/814) and expresses its intention to study its recommendations. The Council welcomes the efforts of the United Nations system, Member States, civil society and other relevant actors to promote the equal participation of women in efforts to build sustainable peace and security.  ""The Security Council strongly condemns the continued acts of gender-based violence in situations of armed conflict. The Council also condemns all violations of the human rights of women and girls in situations of armed conflict and the use of sexual exploitation, violence and abuse. The Council urges the complete cessation by all parties of such acts with immediate effect. The Council stresses the need to end impunity for such acts as part of a comprehensive approach to seeking peace, justice, truth and national reconciliation. The Council welcomes the efforts of the United Nations system to establish and implement strategies and programmes to prevent and report on gender-based violence, and urges the Secretary-General to further his efforts in this regard. The Council requests the Secretary- General to ensure that human rights monitors and members of commissions of inquiry have the necessary expertise and training in gender-based crimes and in the conduct of investigations, including in a culturally sensitive manner favourable to the needs, dignity and rights of the victims. The Council urges all international and national courts specifically established to prosecute war-related crimes to provide gender expertise, gender training for all staff and gender- sensitive programmes for victims and witness protection. The Council emphasizes the urgent need for programmes that provide support to survivors of gender-based violence. The Council further requests that appropriate attention is given to the issue of gender-based violence in all future reports to the Council.  ""The Security Council reaffirms the important role of women in the prevention of conflict and supports the Secretary-General's intention to develop a comprehensive system- wide strategy and action plan for increasing attention to gender perspectives in conflict prevention. The Council urges all relevant actors to work collaboratively, including through strengthened interaction with women's organizations, to ensure the full participation of women and the incorporation of a gender perspective in all conflict prevention work.  ""The Security Council also welcomes the Secretary-General's intention to develop a comprehensive strategy and action plan for mainstreaming a gender perspective into all peacekeeping activities and operations and to  incorporate gender perspectives in each thematic and country report to the Council. In support of this process, the Council reaffirms its commitment to integrate fully gender perspectives into the mandates of all peacekeeping missions. The Council recognizes the contribution of the gender adviser within the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to advancing the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), and requests the Secretary-General to consider an equivalent arrangement within the Department of Political Affairs to further support such implementation.  ""The Security Council considers that an increase in the representation of women in all aspects of conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peace-building operations and humanitarian response is urgently needed. To that end, the Council urges the Secretary-General to strengthen his efforts to identify suitable female candidates, including, as appropriate, from troop-contributing countries, in conformity with Article 101 of the Charter of the United Nations and taking into account the principle of equitable geographical balance. Such efforts should include the implementation of targeted recruitment strategies and also seek to identify candidates for senior level positions, including in the military and civilian police services.  ""The Security Council recognizes the vital contribution of women in promoting peace and their role in reconstruction processes. The Council welcomes the Secretary-General's intention to develop strategies to encourage women's full participation in all stages of the peace process. The Council also requests the Secretary-General to encourage gender mainstreaming in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes by developing guidelines to increase attention to the needs of women and girls in such programmes. The Council further requests the Secretary-General to mainstream a gender perspective in all aspects of post-conflict reconstruction programmes, including through the strengthening of gender theme groups in countries emerging from conflict, and to ensure that all policies and programmes in support of post-conflict constitutional, judicial and legislative reform,  including truth and reconciliation and electoral processes, promote the full participation of women, gender equality and women's human rights.  ""The Security Council recognizes the important contribution of civil society to the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and encourages Member States to continue to collaborate with civil society, in particular with local women's networks and organizations, in order to strengthen implementation. To that end, the Council welcomes the efforts of Member States in implementing resolution 1325 (2000) at the national level, including the development of national action plans, and encourages Member States to continue to pursue such implementation.  ""The Security Council recognizes that significant progress has been made in the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) in certain areas of the United Nations peace and security work. The Council expresses its readiness to further promote the implementation of this resolution, and in particular through active cooperation with the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly. In order to further consolidate this progress, the Council requests the Secretary-General to submit to the Security Council in October 2005 an action plan, with time lines, for implementing resolution 1325 (2000) across the United Nations system, with a view to strengthening commitment and accountability at the highest levels, as well as to allow for improved accountability, monitoring and reporting on progress on implementation within the United Nations system.""

By way of introduction, I would like to say that it  is a particular pleasure for me to open the debate today to observe the anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security. This resolution was indeed a turning point in the activity of the Council, as it underlined the essential contribution women make to peace and security. Five years after its adoption, this meeting will express our collective resolve to enhance the role of women in conflict prevention and resolution. I trust we shall have a successful debate. During the preparations for the meeting I have seen goodwill, commitment and support from many of our partners and I would like to take the time to thank as many of them as members' patience will allow.  I turn first to our colleagues from the Permanent Mission of Denmark to convey our appreciation for their dedication and professionalism in organizing the Arria formula meeting held two days ago.

UNSC_2005_SPV.5294Resumption1_spch004.txt,2005,5294,"The President: I should now like to make a statement in my national capacity.  I should indicate from the outset that Romania fully aligns itself with the statement that was made this morning by the British Ambassador on behalf of the European Union.  Within the United Nations system and elsewhere, there is growing international consensus that women's participation in conflict prevention and peace processes is a matter of having a solid understanding of and healthy perspective on the issue. We are told and we say that the role of women in decision-making is important and legitimate, serves the cause of peace, and fosters reconstruction and reconciliation. It is generally argued that women's empowerment would ensure that those who are frequently the most vulnerable play a role in the transformation and rebuilding of their societies.  That is an assumption that needs challenging. Women should be acknowledged as having a valuable contribution to make to their societies and to international relations not because of their high potential as victims, but because they are recognized as valuable and skilful resources, able to make a difference and bring added value to peace processes in all parts of the world.  Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) marked, in our view, our acceptance and endorsement of a different mindset about women in peace and security. We often predetermine policies and decisions, categorizing women as vulnerable beings and identifying them primarily as likely victims. Resolution 1325 (2000), however, recognizes the true dimension of women's capabilities to contribute to and to be equal partners with men in peace processes and to contribute substantially to the development of their societies.  We have vivid illustrations of those facts. Women fight wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, contribute to post- conflict reconstruction in Kosovo and Bosnia, are excellent peacekeepers in Africa, act as devoted parliamentarians, and make decisions in governmental structures in Rwanda, Uganda and Eritrea.  From the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) onwards, this Council - and the entire United Nations system, we should like to believe - have acted towards and given support to a wider and more balanced presence of women in peace and security. The participation of women in conflict prevention and resolution is no longer narrowly defined as a matter of gender equality and no longer confined to a perspective of human rights, democratic practices or social justice. It is a matter of a whole new mentality acknowledging that women embody political representation at all levels and in all societies and have the necessary knowledge, expertise and resources to participate in the advancement of their societies through their active contributions to disarmament, demobilization and reintegration processes.  At this point, we wish to stress our View that the role of women as agents of development and peace should transcend boundaries and cultures. Engaging women in national and international affairs does not mean changing one's particular system of values. It is within the richness of each particular system that gender perspectives should be sought, put in the spotlight and mainstreamed into politics and policies. States, the United Nations, regional organizations and non-governmental organizations must work together in order to close the gap that still exists between discourse and the diplomatic perspective, on the one hand, and the reality on the ground, on the other.  A starting point in that direction is the recent report of the Secretary-General on women, peace and security, particularly the system-wide action plan for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). We express our appreciation to the Secretariat for such a unique and complex work, which we believe is a useful tool and framework of action for gender mainstreaming in all activities being carried out by the United Nations system.  The continued implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) calls for ongoing scrutiny at the national and international levels of all forms of violence against and abuse of women in conflict or post-conflict situations by combatants or United Nations peacekeeping personnel, as well as of trafficking in human beings, women refugees and internally displaced persons.  In Romania, with the valuable help and support of the United Nations Population Fund, this October organized an international conference on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). The conference in Bucharest brought together participants from Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Zambia, Palestine, Timor-Leste, Thailand, the Sudan and Kosovo. They discussed the value of the resolution and how to move forward, share experiences and methodologies for its implementation and, most important, how to narrow the gap between the text's provisions and reality on the ground.  It is indeed true that, even when women are guaranteed their civil and political rights by a network of institutions and norms, legal stipulations, even when just and unambiguous, cannot by themselves ensure gender equity in the diversity of social and political life. Empowering women is about overcoming prejudice and marginalization and marshalling political will to recognize them as resourceful contributors to decision-making. It is Romania's position that we should all shift our approach to women and peace and security to one that views their participation as the rule rather than the exception. We should also move from words to action and, last but not least, treat women as full partners rather than as a special category.  I now resume my functions as President of the Council.

""The Security Council recalls the 2005 World Summit Outcome (General Assembly resolution A/60/1), the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (A/CONF.177/20/Rev.1), the outcomes of the Conference and of the twenty- third special session of the General Assembly, entitled 'Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century', and the Declaration of the forty-ninth session of the Commission on the Status of Women on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women (E/CN.6/2005/11).  ""While welcoming the progress achieved so far, the Security Council stresses the importance and urgency of accelerating the full and effective implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  ""The Security Council reaffirms the importance of full and equal participation of women in peace processes at all levels and urges Member States, regional and subregional organizations and the United Nations system to enhance the role of women in decision-making with regard to all peace processes and post- conflict reconstruction and rebuilding of societies.  ""The Security Council welcomes the various initiatives and actions undertaken by Member States, the United Nations entities, civil society organizations and other relevant actors, focused on supporting and increasing the representation of women in peace negotiations and mainstreaming gender perspectives into peace agreements.  ""The Security Council recognizes and welcomes the roles of, and contributions made by, women as mediators, educators, peacemakers,  peacebuilders and advocates for peace, as well as their active contribution to reconciliation efforts and disarmament, demobilization and reintegration processes.  ""The Security Council recognizes the constant underrepresentation of women in formal peace processes and is deeply concerned about persistent obstacles and challenges resulting from situations such as violence against women, shattered economies and social structures, lack of rule of law, poverty, limited access to education and resources, various forms of discrimination and stereotypes. The Security Council believes that more must be done in order to achieve the greater participation and effective contribution of women at the negotiating table and in developing and implementing post-conflict strategies and programmes.  ""The Security Council encourages Member States and the Secretary-General to maintain regular contacts with local women's organizations and networks, to utilize their knowledge, expertise and resources and to ensure their involvement in reconstruction processes, particularly at the decision-making level.  ""The Security Council also encourages Member States, donors and civil society to provide financial, political and technical support, as well as adequate training for women's peacebuilding initiatives and networks.  ""The Security Council welcomes the United Nations system-wide action plan for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) across the United Nations system, contained in the report of the Secretary-General on women and peace and security (S/2005/636), and requests the Secretary-General to update, monitor and review its implementation and integration on an annual basis, and report to the Security Council, starting in October 2006. In this context, the Security Council urges the Secretary-General to proceed with the appointment of a gender adviser within the Department of Political Affairs and to continue to identify women candidates for senior level positions within the United Nations system, including as Special Representatives. In this regard, the Council invites the Member States to  provide the Secretary-General with candidates, as appropriate.  ""The Security Council reiterates its call to Member States to continue to implement resolution 1325 (2000), including through the development of national action plans or other national level strategies.  ""The Security Council welcomes the decision taken in the 2005 World Summit Outcome (General Assembly resolution 60/1) to establish the Peacebuilding Commission and looks forward to its contribution to the full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), inviting the Commission to pay particular attention to the knowledge and understanding women can bring, through their participation and empowerment, in peacebuilding processes. ""The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to ensure that all peace accords concluded with United Nations assistance address the specific effects of armed conflict on women and girls, as well as their specific needs and priorities in the post-conflict context. Within this framework, the Security Council underlines the importance of a broad and inclusive political consultation with various components of civil society, in particular women's organizations and groups.  ""The Security Council reaffirms its commitment to integrate gender perspectives into the terms of reference of Security Council visits and missions and to include gender specialists in its teams wherever possible.  ""The Security Council condemns sexual and other forms of violence against women, including trafficking in persons, and calls upon all parties to armed conflict to ensure full and effective protection of women and emphasizes the necessity to end impunity of those responsible for gender-based violence.  ""The Security Council reiterates its condemnation, in the strongest terms, of all acts of sexual misconduct by all categories of personnel in United Nations peacekeeping missions. The Council welcomes the comprehensive report on sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations peacekeeping personnel (A/59/710). The Council also welcomes the report of the resumed session of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations (A/59/19/Add.1) and, taking into account resolution 59/300 of the General Assembly, urges the Secretary-General and troop-contributing countries to ensure that the recommendations of the Special Committee, which fall within their respective responsibilities, are implemented without delay. In this connection, the Council expresses its support for the efforts of the United Nations to fully implement codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures to prevent and respond to sexual exploitation and enhance monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, and notes the strategies and actions included in the system-wide action plan to fully implement those codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures.  ""The Security Council urges troop- contributing countries to take appropriate preventive action, including the conduct of pre- deployment awareness training, and to take disciplinary action and other action to ensure full accountability in cases of misconduct involving their personnel.""

""The Security Council recognizes and welcomes the roles of, and contributions made by, women as mediators, educators, peacemakers,  peacebuilders and advocates for peace, as well as their active contribution to reconciliation efforts and disarmament, demobilization and reintegration processes.  ""The Security Council recognizes the constant underrepresentation of women in formal peace processes and is deeply concerned about persistent obstacles and challenges resulting from situations such as violence against women, shattered economies and social structures, lack of rule of law, poverty, limited access to education and resources, various forms of discrimination and stereotypes. The Security Council believes that more must be done in order to achieve the greater participation and effective contribution of women at the negotiating table and in developing and implementing post-conflict strategies and programmes.  ""The Security Council encourages Member States and the Secretary-General to maintain regular contacts with local women's organizations and networks, to utilize their knowledge, expertise and resources and to ensure their involvement in reconstruction processes, particularly at the decision-making level.  ""The Security Council also encourages Member States, donors and civil society to provide financial, political and technical support, as well as adequate training for women's peacebuilding initiatives and networks.  ""The Security Council welcomes the United Nations system-wide action plan for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) across the United Nations system, contained in the report of the Secretary-General on women and peace and security (S/2005/636), and requests the Secretary-General to update, monitor and review its implementation and integration on an annual basis, and report to the Security Council, starting in October 2006. In this context, the Security Council urges the Secretary-General to proceed with the appointment of a gender adviser within the Department of Political Affairs and to continue to identify women candidates for senior level positions within the United Nations system, including as Special Representatives. In this regard, the Council invites the Member States to  provide the Secretary-General with candidates, as appropriate.  ""The Security Council reiterates its call to Member States to continue to implement resolution 1325 (2000), including through the development of national action plans or other national level strategies.  ""The Security Council welcomes the decision taken in the 2005 World Summit Outcome (General Assembly resolution 60/1) to establish the Peacebuilding Commission and looks forward to its contribution to the full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), inviting the Commission to pay particular attention to the knowledge and understanding women can bring, through their participation and empowerment, in peacebuilding processes. ""The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to ensure that all peace accords concluded with United Nations assistance address the specific effects of armed conflict on women and girls, as well as their specific needs and priorities in the post-conflict context. Within this framework, the Security Council underlines the importance of a broad and inclusive political consultation with various components of civil society, in particular women's organizations and groups.  ""The Security Council reaffirms its commitment to integrate gender perspectives into the terms of reference of Security Council visits and missions and to include gender specialists in its teams wherever possible.  ""The Security Council condemns sexual and other forms of violence against women, including trafficking in persons, and calls upon all parties to armed conflict to ensure full and effective protection of women and emphasizes the necessity to end impunity of those responsible for gender-based violence.  ""The Security Council reiterates its condemnation, in the strongest terms, of all acts of sexual misconduct by all categories of personnel in United Nations peacekeeping missions. The Council welcomes the comprehensive report on sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations peacekeeping personnel (A/59/710). The Council also welcomes the report of the resumed session of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations (A/59/19/Add.1) and, taking into account resolution 59/300 of the General Assembly, urges the Secretary-General and troop-contributing countries to ensure that the recommendations of the Special Committee, which fall within their respective responsibilities, are implemented without delay. In this connection, the Council expresses its support for the efforts of the United Nations to fully implement codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures to prevent and respond to sexual exploitation and enhance monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, and notes the strategies and actions included in the system-wide action plan to fully implement those codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures.  ""The Security Council urges troop- contributing countries to take appropriate preventive action, including the conduct of pre- deployment awareness training, and to take disciplinary action and other action to ensure full accountability in cases of misconduct involving their personnel.""  This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2005/52.  The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.  The meeting rose at 6.35 pm. "

UNSC_2006_SPV.5379_spch021.txt,2006,5379,"The President: I will now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of the United States.  I would like to thank both the Secretariat and Prince Zeid for their briefings today on this matter. In particular, I would like to commend Prince Zeid for the important work he has done as the Secretary-General's Special Adviser to shine light on what is arguably one of the greatest stains on United Nations history. It is absolutely unacceptable that horrific crimes of sexual abuse and exploitation have been committed by United Nations peacekeepers against individuals they have been assigned to protect.  Having an open briefing on this subject is important because, while we rightly express our moral outrage, we must take firm and decisive action. We  must take action now, not only to pursue justice and a resolution to the crimes that have already been committed, but also to establish the necessary institutions, mechanisms, training and oversight procedures to ensure they are not repeated in existing and future peacekeeping operations. We cannot wait months and years while more children are exploited and the reputation of United Nations peacekeepers continues to decline.  Failure to act on this matter will have profound implications for both existing and future peacekeeping missions. As we begin to plan our next operation in Darfur, we do not want to contemplate potential headlines of United Nations peacekeepers in Darfur raping the very population that they are entrusted to protect. We concur in full with Under-Secretary- General Guehenno when he remarked last May that,  ""Indeed, it is precisely our image and reputation that gives us the credibility to work so effectively in war-torn countries and bring peace and stability to millions across the world. Eliminating such misconduct is therefore integral to the success of peacekeeping"". (S/PV.5]91, p. 5)  Throughout our wide-ranging discussions on a variety of issues related to United Nations reform, we have spoken of the need for a fundamental change in the culture and the way the United Nations operates. We have heard Paul Volcker, Chairman of the Commission investigating the oil-for-food scandal, speak of a culture of inaction. Just yesterday, we discussed the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) report on Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) procurement, where OIOS spoke of a culture of impunity.  Resolution and prevention of future acts of sexual exploitation and abuse call for the same fundamental shift. We are pleased that the Secretariat acknowledges this point, with Under-Secretary-General Guehenno remarking that,  ""We need to create a culture and environment in peacekeeping operations that does not permit sexual exploitation and abuse. This requires joint action by both DPKO and Member States"". (ibid, P- 7)  The United States, for its part, takes its responsibility as a Member State seriously in this regard. We are working closely with others to finalize language in the new, amended Memorandum of Understanding issued by DPKO last fall and encourage other troop- contributing countries to do so as well.  The United States Congress has expressed keen interest in this matter and has taken action. In 2005, Congress passed and President Bush signed the 2005 re-authorization of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. This new legislation requires the Executive Branch, starting in June 2006, to report annually to the United States Congress on the actions taken by the United Nations and other international organizations to prevent trafficking and sexual exploitation and abuse by employees, contractors and peacekeeping forces. It also requires the Secretary of State to report to the United States Congress on the effectiveness of those actions prior to voting on any new or re-authorized peacekeeping mission.  The United States Government has also taken action on an important matter closely linked to the problem of sexual exploitation and abuse at the hands of peacekeepers, namely, the spread of HIV. We have fully supported, and will continue to support, Security Council resolution 1308 (2000). The United States Department of Defense, and more recently the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, have provided resources and technical assistance to implement long-term strategies for HIV/AIDS education, prevention, counselling, testing and treatment in more than 70 military and peacekeeping populations around the world. Since the adoption of resolution 1308 (2000), the United States has assisted with the HIV/AIDS education of over two million uniformed personnel, trained 7,000 uniformed peer educators, established more than 200 HIV/AIDS counselling and testing facilities on or near military bases, provided HIV/AIDS diagnostic and screening equipment to 30 armed forces and trained over 600 uniformed medical personnel in the care and treatment of HIV-infected personnel and their families.  We strongly endorse the recommendations of the United Nations General Assembly's Special Committee on Peacekeeping to strengthen enforcement of a uniform United Nations code of conduct for peacekeepers, improve the capacity of the United Nations, in cooperation with troop-contributing countries, to investigate allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse, establish assistance to and compensation for victims and enhance pre- and post- deployment training for United Nations peacekeepers.  We also welcome the creation of personal conduct units within the United Nations missions in Burundi, Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, East Timor, Haiti, Liberia, Sierra Leone and the Sudan to address allegations and assist victims. We feel it is critical that all United Nations missions include similar units in each of their respective fields. We will strongly encourage other United Nations Security Council members to continue to support the inclusion in United Nations Security Council resolutions establishing peacekeeping operations specific and strong language to that end. Finally, we take special note of DPKO efforts to increase the participation of female uniformed personnel serving in United Nations peacekeeping operations.  We are concerned, however, about the status and progress of the investigations into past cases of abuse. We understand that the Office of Internal Oversight Services took over all investigations as of last October and is expected to issue a report this May. We expect that DPKO will cooperate fully with OIOS in its investigations of past abuses and in providing access to all information on new allegations as they surface. We know this is a daunting task and that OIOS has only begun to scratch the surface of this problem. To date, the United Nations has investigated 295 cases, resulting in 137 repatriations and 16 dismissals of soldiers, commanders, police and United Nations staff. It is also critical that OIOS operate with complete autonomy to investigate these matters. This will help all parts of the Organization by insulating it from accusations of trying to cover up the scope and magnitude of the problem.  I note that OIOS is absent today, as it was absent yesterday, and we find this troubling. I note also that the Secretary-General's Chief of Staff did not answer my question yesterday on the independence of OIOS, and we find that troubling as well. We intend to pursue these matters.  All of these vitally needed reforms by the United Nations must be matched by resolve on the part of troop-contributing countries to prevent and punish crimes by their personnel who participate in United Nations peacekeeping missions. Pre- and post- deployment training, compliance, adequate living standards for troops, discipline and compensation for victims require commitment and action by troop- contributing countries. We understand that no system will be perfect, and there will be instances that require Member States to prosecute their citizens in their own courts. For those countries that have repatriated alleged perpetrators of these heinous crimes, we encourage them in the strongest terms to follow the lead of countries such as Morocco and be transparent and forthright in their judicial proceedings. The international community expects no less. We know this is not always an easy task, but it is an important one.  It was two years ago that the world began to wake up to the reality that we are confronted with today - that the sexual exploitation and abuse of women and children at the hands of United Nations peacekeepers is not an isolated incident. It is a widespread scourge that creates lasting victims, scarred for their lifetimes. The ""boys will be boys"" attitude, which too long pervaded peacekeeping operations, must correctly be met with a zero tolerance policy. Now that we are aware of this problem, though, it is time to take this recognition and translate it into decisive action without delay. We should do so not just because we recognize the impact of such crimes on the success of a particular mission, but because it is our moral and ethical responsibility to do as much as possible to prevent the sexual exploitation and abuse of women and children, wherever it may exist.  I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.  The next speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of Brazil. I now give him the floor.

By way of introduction, I would like to say that it is a particular pleasure for me to open the debate today to discuss the implementation of the important resolution, resolution 1325 (2000). Our theme is the roles of women in the consolidation of peace.  I wish to convey to our British colleague, Ambassador Sir Emyr Jones Parry, and other colleagues from the Permanent Mission of the United Kingdom our appreciation for their dedication and professionalism in organizing the Arria formula meeting held yesterday. It was valuable for Council members and other concerned people to gain greater insight into the challenges and the lessons learned by hearing the voices of real experience on the ground as expressed by the representatives of civil society. We hope to intensify the efforts in further implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) with the cooperation and partnership of civil society.  Finally, I would like to thank all speakers in advance.

Six years after the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), it is again time to take stock of the progress made and renew our commitment to move towards achieving the goals set out in this important resolution.  The consolidation of peace encompasses an endeavour and a process that require a comprehensive approach, involving all stakeholders and sustained international support, including that of the United Nations. Women play critical roles in such endeavours and processes, and landmark resolution 1325 (2000) has contributed significantly to enhancing women's ability to fully commit themselves to rebuilding their communities, ensuring sustainable peace and preventing the recurrence of conflict. This has been and continues to be an essential pillar in the consolidation of peace.  I take this opportunity to commend all the efforts made by the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, by the United Nations Development Fund for Women and by all other development, humanitarian, human rights and advocacy agencies, organizations and groups, both inside and outside the United Nations system, for promoting the goals set out in resolution 1325 (2000), while fully admitting that there still remains a lot that needs to be done. We welcome the fact that, in the Peacebuilding Commission, which is focusing on Sierra Leone and Burundi, the importance of integrating gender perspectives into peacebuilding activities is specifically and emphatically noted. We expect that the outcome of today's debate, along with useful suggestions that have been made, will be reflected appropriately in the work of the Peacebuilding Commission so as to further assist in the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  In our view, the debate on the role of women and peace and security and the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) should inform and be informed by the concept of human security and the people- centred approach that it advocates. Promoting the empowerment of each individual and protecting individuals from threats to their safety and basic well- being is the ultimate goal of human security. Implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) should contribute to enhancing human security for women. It should also promote institutional reforms that integrate the needs and priorities of women so as to strengthen their empowerment and protection.  As part of its efforts to promote human security in practice on the ground, Japan helped set up the United Nations Trust Fund for Human Security in 1999. During the past few years, the Trust Fund has supported over 160 projects in more than 90 countries and regions, and many of them have contributed towards the empowerment and protection of women and children. With this end in mind, many of the projects approved under the Trust Fund are implemented in partnership with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society groups active in this field. One example is that of a local NGO, Dushirehamwe, in Burundi, coordinated by Ms. Christine Miturumbwe, who delivered a statement here today. Among other activities, Dushirehamwe is implementing a project that aims to help returnees and internally displaced women to improve their economic capacities, thereby facilitating communal reconciliation and coexistence between the local population and the returnees and internally displaced persons.  Women's participation has enormous significance in ensuring the consolidation of peace and community reconstruction. Resolution 1325 (2000) provides the necessary framework, and it needs to be implemented with all the vigour and support it deserves, and Japan intends to continue to do its utmost to contribute to that end.  I now resume my functions as President of the Council.  At this juncture, I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of Comoros, in which he requests to be invited to participate in the consideration of the item on the Council's agenda.

""The Security Council recognizes that the protection and empowerment of women and support for their networks and initiatives are essential in the consolidation of peace to promote the equal and full participation of women and to improve their human security, and encourages Member States, donors and civil society to provide support in this respect.  ""The Security Council recognizes the importance of integrating gender perspectives into institutional reform in post-conflict countries at both the national and local levels. The Security Council encourages Member States in post- conflict situations to ensure that gender perspectives are mainstreamed in their institutional reform, ensuring that the reforms, in particular of the security sector, justice institutions and restoration of the rule of law, provide for the protection of women's rights and safety. The Council also requests the Secretary- General to ensure that United Nations assistance in this context appropriately addresses the needs and priorities of women in the post-conflict process.  ""The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to ensure that disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes take specific account of the situation of women ex-combatants and women associated with combatants, as well as their children, and provide for their full access to these programmes. ""The Security Council welcomes the role that the Peacebuilding Commission can play in mainstreaming gender perspectives into the peace consolidation process. In this context, the Council welcomes in particular the Chairman's summaries at its country-specific meetings on Sierra Leone and Burundi on 12 and 13 October 2006.  ""The Security Council remains deeply concerned by the pervasiveness of all forms of violence against women in armed conflicts, including killing, maiming, grave sexual violence, abductions and trafficking in persons. The Council reiterates its utmost condemnation of such practices and calls upon all parties to armed conflict to ensure full and effective protection of women, and emphasizes the necessity to end impunity of those responsible for gender-based violence.  ""The Security Council reiterates its condemnation, in the strongest terms, of all acts of sexual misconduct by all categories of personnel in United Nations peacekeeping missions. The Council urges the Secretary- General and troop-contributing countries to ensure the full implementation of the recommendations of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations (A/60/19). In this connection, the Council expresses its support for further efforts by the United Nations to fully implement codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures to prevent and respond to sexual exploitation and abuse, and enhance monitoring and enforcement mechanisms based on a zero- tolerance policy.  ""The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to include in his reporting to the Security Council progress in gender mainstreaming throughout United Nations peacekeeping missions as well as on other aspects relating specifically to women and girls.

""The Security Council recognizes that the protection and empowerment of women and support for their networks and initiatives are essential in the consolidation of peace to promote the equal and full participation of women and to improve their human security, and encourages Member States, donors and civil society to provide support in this respect.  ""The Security Council recognizes the importance of integrating gender perspectives into institutional reform in post-conflict countries at both the national and local levels. The Security Council encourages Member States in post- conflict situations to ensure that gender perspectives are mainstreamed in their institutional reform, ensuring that the reforms, in particular of the security sector, justice institutions and restoration of the rule of law, provide for the protection of women's rights and safety. The Council also requests the Secretary- General to ensure that United Nations assistance in this context appropriately addresses the needs and priorities of women in the post-conflict process.  ""The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to ensure that disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes take specific account of the situation of women ex-combatants and women associated with combatants, as well as their children, and provide for their full access to these programmes. ""The Security Council welcomes the role that the Peacebuilding Commission can play in mainstreaming gender perspectives into the peace consolidation process. In this context, the Council welcomes in particular the Chairman's summaries at its country-specific meetings on Sierra Leone and Burundi on 12 and 13 October 2006.  ""The Security Council remains deeply concerned by the pervasiveness of all forms of violence against women in armed conflicts, including killing, maiming, grave sexual violence, abductions and trafficking in persons. The Council reiterates its utmost condemnation of such practices and calls upon all parties to armed conflict to ensure full and effective protection of women, and emphasizes the necessity to end impunity of those responsible for gender-based violence.  ""The Security Council reiterates its condemnation, in the strongest terms, of all acts of sexual misconduct by all categories of personnel in United Nations peacekeeping missions. The Council urges the Secretary- General and troop-contributing countries to ensure the full implementation of the recommendations of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations (A/60/19). In this connection, the Council expresses its support for further efforts by the United Nations to fully implement codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures to prevent and respond to sexual exploitation and abuse, and enhance monitoring and enforcement mechanisms based on a zero- tolerance policy.  ""The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to include in his reporting to the Security Council progress in gender mainstreaming throughout United Nations peacekeeping missions as well as on other aspects relating specifically to women and girls. The Council emphasizes the need for the inclusion of gender components in peacekeeping operations. The Council further encourages Member States and the Secretary-General to increase the participation of women in all areas and all levels of peacekeeping operations, civilian, police and military, where possible. ""The Security Council reiterates its call to Member States to continue to implement resolution 1325 (2000), including through the development and implementation of national action plans or other national-level strategies.  ""The Security Council recognizes the important contribution of civil society to the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and encourages Member States to continue to collaborate with civil society, in particular with local women's networks and organizations, in order to strengthen implementation.  ""The Security Council looks forward to the report of the High-Level Panel on United Nations System-wide Coherence in the Areas of Development, Humanitarian Assistance and the Environment and hopes this will play a role in ensuring a coordinated United Nations approach to women and peace and security.  ""The Security Council welcomes the first follow-up report of the Secretary-General (S/2006/770) on the United Nations System-wide Action Plan for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) across the United Nations system. The Council requests the Secretary-General to continue to update, monitor and review the implementation and integration of the Action Plan and report to the Security Council as stipulated in the statement by the President of the Security Council of 27 October 2005 (S/PRST/2005/52).""  This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2006/42.  I thank all Council members, all the delegations that spoke under rule 37, the four speakers from the Secretariat and agencies, and the two speakers from civil society for their important contributions to the debate this morning and this afternoon.  There are no further speakers inscribed on my list. The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda. The meeting rose at 6.15 pm. "

UNSC_2007_SPV.5766_spch028.txt,2007,5766,"The President: I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ghana.  It is a great pleasure for me join the Council at this meeting, which, in my view, has provided fresh and welcome insights into how we can work together to meet what we all agree is one of the foremost challenges facing the world community in this century. The vital role of women in building and maintaining international peace and security has already been forcefully brought home to us. Our shared goal remains securing women's full and meaningful involvement in that enterprise. Therefore, I commend the Security Council on its leadership and its determination to bring to fruition the goals set out in resolution 1325 (2000) of October 2000.  I further acknowledge the important steps that have been taken by the Secretary-General to ensure that not only does the United Nations remain a pacesetter in gender-mainstreaming, but that it also extends vital support to Member States in order for them to fulfil their obligations under resolution 1325 (2000).  Ghana welcomes the commitment shown by the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women (OSAGI), the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), and the various non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and advocacy groups that are actively promoting the objectives enshrined in the resolution.  Like other delegations, we also attach great importance to the issues of coordination, accountability, monitoring and evaluation, both within the United Nations system and in the context of national action plans, in accordance with the resolution. Therefore, we consider worthy of emulation the example shown by those Governments that are far advanced in developing national action plans aimed at mainstreaming a gender perspective in the training of military personnel, especially those sent on peacekeeping missions.  Significantly, a gender perspective is also increasingly being integrated into aid packages designed for countries that have recently emerged from conflict. These positive trends, in themselves, demonstrate what could be achieved if Member States were to commit themselves fully to the effective implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). As has been repeatedly stated, the resolution provides a workable framework for action by all stakeholders.  Much as we are encouraged by the steady progress that has been made since the adoption of the resolution, we believe nevertheless that the challenges and gaps that have been highlighted during this debate deserve serious attention.  The apparent lack of political will on the part of some Governments, coupled with genuine financial and human resource constraints, has contributed to the inadequate institutional response to resolution 1325 (2000) that has been observed by various speakers.  The Secretary-General has put forward several concrete proposals in his latest progress report on resolution 1325 (2000) touching on a number of priority areas. Member States, the United Nations system and civil society actors are all called upon to intensify their efforts towards achieving tangible results that would be reflected in the increased participation of women in decision-making and peace processes, and in the protection of women and girls in conflict situations, inter alia.  Ghana has made considerable progress in developing the necessary legal and institutional frameworks that can facilitate the implementation of the resolution, including the establishment of a Ministry for Women and Children's Affairs. Our objective is to give due prominence and practical meaning to the issues that remain at the heart of our concerns. In the coming years, we shall be seeking closer collaboration between Government and Ghanaian civil society groups and with our respective counterparts abroad. That is in recognition of the benefits of global networking.  For its part, the Security Council should similarly explore the feasibility of a follow-up mechanism that would, in addition to the annual open debates, enable it to monitor closely the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) in a more coordinated and systematic fashion. As the organ with primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, the Council has more than a functional interest in ensuring the equal participation and full involvement of women in all aspects of peace and security.  The preponderance of women and girls among the victims of human rights abuses and gender-based violence, both during and after conflicts, poses a direct challenge to the authority of the Security Council, but the situation also imbues the Council's mandate with a profound meaning. Indeed, the Secretary-General eloquently summed it up in his 2004 report, entitled ""Women and peace and security"" when he observed that,  ""Resolution 1325 (2000) holds out a promise to women across the globe that their rights will be protected and that barriers to their equal participation and full involvement in the maintenance and promotion of sustainable peace will be removed. We must uphold this promise."" (S/2004/814, para. 121)  I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.

With the forbearance of my colleagues, I would like to make introductory remarks on behalf of my country in my national capacity. As I hear no objection, I shall proceed; I promise to be brief.  Thank you all for joining us; I would especially like to thank the Secretary-General for his leadership. I should like to commend you, Mr. Secretary-General, for your commitment to increasing the number of women candidates for United Nations Special Representative and Special Envoy positions. When I, along with the members of the Women Leaders Working Group, first began looking at this issue, we realized that in the 60 years of United Nations peacekeeping, only seven women had held the post of Special Representative to the Secretary-General. You immediately took the lead in helping to address that, Mr. Secretary-General, and today Margrethe Loj of Denmark is now the Special Representative for Liberia. We applaud you for your commitment, and we look forward to working with you on that critical issue.  I also want to commend all of you here today, my fellow Council members, and I want to thank those who have travelled from afar to show their dedication to the important issue of ending the use of rape and other forms of sexual violence as instruments of warfare. Rape is a crime that can never be condoned. Yet women and girls in conflict situations around the world have been subjected to widespread and deliberate acts of sexual violence. As many here are aware, for years there has been a debate about whether or not sexual Violence against women is a security issue for this forum to address.  I am proud that today we can respond to that lingering question with a resounding ""yes"". This world body now acknowledges that sexual violence in conflict zones is, indeed, a security concern. We affirm that sexual violence profoundly affects not only the health and safety of women, but also the economic and social stability of their nations.  The draft resolution before us establishes a mechanism for bringing those atrocities to light. Specifically, the draft requests that the Secretary- General prepare an action plan for collecting 08-39069  information on the use of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict and then report that information periodically to the Council.  We already know of the unimaginable brutality against women that exists in some parts of the world. In Burma, for instance, soldiers have regularly raped women and girls as young as 8 years old. I must note that what is also tragic in that country is that instead of being allowed to take the office of the elected leader of Burma's Government, Aung San Suu Kyi is marking her birthday this very day under house arrest. We cannot forget, as we examine that issue, other women activists who struggle for freedom in violent environments.  We are concerned about the issue of women affected by violence across the world, in places such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Sudan and many others.  As an international community, we have a special responsibility to punish perpetrators of sexual violence who are representatives of international organizations. Last year, there were reports of sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations peacekeepers in several United Nations missions and by staff at the United Nations Mission in Liberia. The encouraging news is that steps have been taken to address that. One of the perpetrators is serving a sentence in his country, and several other cases remain under investigation. That situation should serve as a model for all countries contributing troops to United Nations operations. While the individual perpetrator is ultimately responsible for the abuse, Member States are responsible for disciplining and holding their troops accountable.  Finally, we must work together to provide the necessary protection and assistance to victims of sexual violence. In recent years, the United States has provided more than $40 million to protect women and girls in Darfur and to provide for sexual violence prevention in response projects worldwide. We have also addressed the issue of sexual violence by devoting $528 million over the last seven fiscal years to fighting human trafficking, another grave abuse of human dignity that is all too frequently committed against women and girls, especially in conflict situations.  One of the most important ways in which we must measure the value of our international community is by how effective we are in protecting, and providing justice 3 for, the most vulnerable of our members. When women and girls are preyed upon and raped, the international community cannot be silent or inactive. It is our responsibility to be their advocates and their defenders. We are taking an important step today that will enable us better to meet that goal, and I want to thank you all for being here to show your strong support.  I now resume my functions as President of the Council.  In accordance with the understanding reached among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers that they should limit their statements to no more than five minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.

Rape is a crime that can never be condoned. Yet women and girls in conflict situations around the world have been subjected to widespread and deliberate acts of sexual violence. As many here are aware, for years there has been a debate about whether or not sexual Violence against women is a security issue for this forum to address.  I am proud that today we can respond to that lingering question with a resounding ""yes"". This world body now acknowledges that sexual violence in conflict zones is, indeed, a security concern. We affirm that sexual violence profoundly affects not only the health and safety of women, but also the economic and social stability of their nations.  The draft resolution before us establishes a mechanism for bringing those atrocities to light. Specifically, the draft requests that the Secretary- General prepare an action plan for collecting 08-39069  information on the use of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict and then report that information periodically to the Council.  We already know of the unimaginable brutality against women that exists in some parts of the world. In Burma, for instance, soldiers have regularly raped women and girls as young as 8 years old. I must note that what is also tragic in that country is that instead of being allowed to take the office of the elected leader of Burma's Government, Aung San Suu Kyi is marking her birthday this very day under house arrest. We cannot forget, as we examine that issue, other women activists who struggle for freedom in violent environments.  We are concerned about the issue of women affected by violence across the world, in places such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Sudan and many others.  As an international community, we have a special responsibility to punish perpetrators of sexual violence who are representatives of international organizations. Last year, there were reports of sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations peacekeepers in several United Nations missions and by staff at the United Nations Mission in Liberia. The encouraging news is that steps have been taken to address that. One of the perpetrators is serving a sentence in his country, and several other cases remain under investigation. That situation should serve as a model for all countries contributing troops to United Nations operations. While the individual perpetrator is ultimately responsible for the abuse, Member States are responsible for disciplining and holding their troops accountable.  Finally, we must work together to provide the necessary protection and assistance to victims of sexual violence. In recent years, the United States has provided more than $40 million to protect women and girls in Darfur and to provide for sexual violence prevention in response projects worldwide. We have also addressed the issue of sexual violence by devoting $528 million over the last seven fiscal years to fighting human trafficking, another grave abuse of human dignity that is all too frequently committed against women and girls, especially in conflict situations.  One of the most important ways in which we must measure the value of our international community is by how effective we are in protecting, and providing justice 3 for, the most vulnerable of our members. When women and girls are preyed upon and raped, the international community cannot be silent or inactive. It is our responsibility to be their advocates and their defenders. We are taking an important step today that will enable us better to meet that goal, and I want to thank you all for being here to show your strong support.  I now resume my functions as President of the Council.  In accordance with the understanding reached among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers that they should limit their statements to no more than five minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate the text in writing and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.  I welcome in particular the participation today of the Secretary-General, His Excellency Ban Ki-moon, and I invite him to take the floor.   "

Eight years ago, the Security Council adopted resolution 1325 (2000), which laid the foundation for cooperation by the international community in this field. We are pleased to see that, thanks to the joint efforts by various intergovernmental organizations, regional and subregional organizations, Member States and civil society, the role of women in the prevention of conflicts, peace talks, peacekeeping operations and post-conflict reconstruction has been strengthened, and the concepts of gender equality and the empowerment of women have taken hold.  However, we must recognize the reality that as the characteristics of conflicts change and various complex factors become interwoven, resolution 1325 (2000) has yet to be fully implemented. In certain conflict situations, enormous suffering and pain continue to be inflicted on women. Unable to protect their personal security, women can hardly take an effective part in peace processes or political life. We attach great importance to this question and wish to stress the following three points.  First, the Security Council has a unique role to play in the question of women, peace and security and should strengthen its coordination and cooperation with other organs of the United Nations. As the organ that bears the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, the Security Council should step up its efforts for the prevention and resolution of conflicts so that the root causes of women's suffering in war can be removed and their rights and interest protected to the greatest extent possible. As the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and UNIFEM. have their respective mandates and roles for promoting the rights and interests of women, the Security Council should strengthen its coordination and cooperation with them and work together in addressing the relevant issues.  Secondly, efforts should be made to facilitate women's participation in every stage of peace processes so that a solid foundation can be created for consolidating the peace process and achieving lasting peace. We hope that the parties concerned will continue to work and to create an enabling environment for women's full participation and in-depth involvement. In recent years, the Secretariat has taken quite a number of positive measures to increase the number of female staff members and women appointed to senior posts. We expect to see more efforts in this direction in the future.  Thirdly, civil society should continue to be encouraged and supported in taking part in the protection of women. Many colleagues from  non-governmental organizations work under difficult conditions in the field to protect the rights and interests of women. Their commendable work deserves our appreciation. China supports them in their continuing efforts to play a constructive role in the protection of women in armed conflict and encourages them to engage with and make recommendations to other organs of the United Nations, especially those that are directly concerned with women's issues.  At the initiative of the delegation of the United Kingdom, the Security Council will adopt a presidential statement at the conclusion of this open debate, in which the Secretary-General will be requested to submit a report on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) by next October. We support that request.  It needs to be pointed out that only a few months ago the Council adopted resolution 1820 (2008), in which the Secretary-General is requested to submit a report on combating sexual violence. We hope that the Secretariat will enhance internal coordination and make the best possible use of the relevant information available to it, so as to submit a report of high quality to the Security Council.

There being no objection, it is so decided.  At the invitation of the President, the representatives of the aforementioned countries took the seats reservedfor them at the side of the Council Chamber.  The President: The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.  I wish to draw the attention of members of the Council to document S/2009/362, which contains the report of the Secretary-General pursuant to Security Council resolution 1820 (2008).  I should like to start by welcoming the Secretary- General, who joins us today to present his first follow- up report to resolution 1820 (2008) on women, peace and security.  In addition, I should like to extend our welcome and thanks to three female United Nations police 2  officers from United Nations missions in Liberia, Haiti and the Sudan, who are here to observe our debate. Yesterday, they attended a round-table event at the United Nations that was sponsored by the Canadian Mission and the Pearson Peacekeeping Training Centre. It is important that we have opportunities in New York to hear from field practitioners dealing with those difficult issues.  Resolution 1820 (2008) builds upon resolution 1325 (2000). It confirms the Council's readiness to address more systematically the scourge of conflict- related sexual violence. It also underlines the vital contribution that women themselves can make as peacekeepers and peacebuilders.  Our objective today is to hear the views of colleagues from across the United Nations membership to aid Council consideration of the way forward in the light of the Secretary-General's report.  I now invite the Secretary-General to take the floor.   "

We welcome the Secretary-General's contribution to our debate today and the continuing presence of the Deputy Secretary-General this morning. The Secretary- General's report (S/2009/362) highlights the challenges that we face in coming to grips with the issue of sexual violence in conflict zones, and it confirms and clarifies much of what we suspected about the extent of the problem. If we are serious about preventing and resolving conflict, then we need to be serious about addressing conflict-related sexual violence.  There is no shortage of will to take forward the Council's work in this area, as Tuesday's adoption of resolution 1882 (2009) on children and armed conflict showed. There are still gaps that we need to bridge in information, capacity, coordination and imagination, and the Secretary-General's report draws these out clearly.  The proliferation of sexual violence against women and girls is in part aimed at marginalizing their contribution to society. It deliberately degrades the role that they can play in restoring the fabric of peaceful communities. The Arria formula meeting that the United Kingdom hosted in June highlighted the critical importance of enhancing women's contribution to peace processes.  Short-term measures to improve protection and enhance women's participation in decision-making have to be accompanied by longer-term efforts to establish accountability and the rule of law. More effective monitoring of patterns of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict should allow the Council to identify and mandate the action necessary to prevent it.  We therefore welcome further reports from the Secretary-General. We support his recommendation that better use be made of commissions of inquiry, and the Council should ensure that conflict-related sexual violence gets the attention it deserves in the informal Expert Group on the Protection of Civilians and in the Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict.  Let me add on a personal note that I share completely Ambassador Rice's conviction that the time to act is now. For those of us who took part in the Security Council mission in May, it was impossible not to be moved and angered by what we saw and heard. The perpetrators of these appalling crimes want to diminish women and exclude them from their role in building peace. If I took any encouragement from our meetings with those who have suffered, it was from their determination not to just remain victims, but to play their full part in finding and securing a lasting peace in which their rights will be respected and their security assured.

The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as resolution 1888 (2009).  I now have the privilege of making a statement in my capacity as Secretary of State of the United States of America.  I am very grateful to speak before the Security Council on this important issue. I want to thank everyone who has worked very hard to reach this point 09-53396 on this resolution and, of course, to have it adopted unanimously. We are here to address an issue that has received too little attention, not only in this Chamber over the past six decades, but also, I would suggest, in all of our halls of Government across the world. It is an important issue that goes to the core of our commitment to ensure the safety of the United Nations Member States and their citizens.  Under the United Nations Charter, the 15 members of this Council bear primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. Satisfying that responsibility includes our protecting the lives and physical security of all people, including the women who comprise half the planet's population. This responsibility is particularly acute in circumstances where peace and stability are challenged.  Even though women and children are rarely responsible for initiating armed conflict, they are often war's most vulnerable and violated victims. The resolution we have adopted today represents a step forward in our global efforts to end violence perpetrated against women and children in conflict zones, and it builds on two prior Security Council resolutions - resolution 1325 (2000), which calls on all parties in conflicts to respect women's rights and increase their participation in peace negotiations and post-conflict reconstruction efforts; and resolution 1820 (2008), which affirms the ambitions set out in resolution 1325 (2000) and establishes a clear link between maintaining international peace and security and preventing and responding to sexual violence used as a tactic of war to target civilians. Yet, despite these actions by the Security Council, violence against women and girls in conflict-related situations has not diminished; in fact, in some cases it has escalated.  Reading the headlines, one might think that the use of rape as a tactic of war happens only occasionally or in a few places, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo or the Sudan. That would be bad enough, but the reality is much worse. We have seen rape used as a tactic of war before in Bosnia, Burma, Sri Lanka and elsewhere. In too many countries and in too many cases, the perpetrators of this violence are not punished, and so this impunity encourages further attacks.  Last month, I travelled to Goma in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, where over 1,100 09-53396  rapes are reported every month. I met with survivors of sexual violence, and the physical and emotional damage to individual women and their families from these attacks cannot be quantified, nor can the toll on their societies. The dehumanizing nature of sexual violence does not harm just a single individual, a single family or even a single village or a single group; it shreds the fabric that weaves us together as human beings. It endangers families and communities, erodes social and political stability, and undermines economic progress. We need to understand that it holds all of us back.  Also, our failure as an international body to respond concretely to this global problem erodes our collective effectiveness. So we must act now to end this crisis, not only to protect vulnerable people and promote human security, but also to uphold the legitimacy of this body.  The international community has made progress. Many peacekeeping mandates now include Security Council requests for strengthened measures to prevent and respond to sexual violence. In Chad and the Sudan, United Nations peacekeepers have clear instructions underscoring their responsibility to protect local populations against sexual and gender-based violence. I recently met with United Nations troops in Liberia, who provide an excellent example of the steps a United Nations mission can take, both through its own actions and in cooperation with the host Government, to prevent violence against women and girls. It is also very important that the United Nations Mission in Liberia includes an all-women police unit from India. That all-women police unit has helped to motivate more Liberian women to become police officers, and the Mission has launched a joint United Nations- Liberian campaign against rape.  These steps are essential but, alone, they are not sufficient. Resolution 1888 (2009) identifies specific steps that the United Nations and Member States can and should take to improve the Organization's response to sexual violence committed during situations of armed conflict. It calls on the Secretary-General to appoint a special representative to lead, coordinate and advocate efforts to end sexual violence. We expect that person to engage at high levels with civilian and military leaders to spearhead the United Nations activities on this front. It also calls on the Secretary- General to rapidly deploy a team of experts to work with Governments to strengthen the rule of law, 3 address impunity and enhance accountability, while drawing attention to the full range of legal venues that can be brought into play, including domestic, international and mixed courts that bring local and international judges and prosecutors together to strengthen local justice systems.  We must also recognize that ending conflicts outright is the most certain path to ending sexual violence in conflicts. So pursuing peace and successful post-conflict transitions should be our highest priority. In States where conflict is taking place and in those that are moving beyond it, local police must receive better training, the rule of law must be strengthened, and survivors must be ensured full access to justice and protection throughout the judicial process. We envision that the team of experts called for in the resolution will help us to strengthen initiatives like those.  Beyond the measures outlined in the resolution, the Security Council should take additional steps. Protecting women and children should be a critical priority for all troops who wear the blue helmet. To reflect this, new and renewed peacekeeping mandates should include language condemning sexual violence and giving further guidance to peacekeeping missions to work with local authorities to end it. We must seek to ensure that our respective military and police forces, especially those that will participate in peacekeeping missions, develop the expertise to prevent and respond to violence against women and children. This will be helped by increasing the number of women who serve in United Nations peacekeeping missions. When I visited the Mission in Goma, I was very impressed at how integrated it was in every way - staff from every country, every kind of person represented, and many women in the leadership as well as in the ranks.  Let us not forget that it is often women who lead the call for peace in communities shattered by violence. We have seen women in this role from Liberia, Rwanda and Northern Ireland to Guatemala. Even when they suffer terrible losses in conflicts they had no part in starting, women have the will to reach across divisions, find common ground and foster understanding. As they seek peace, so must we by making sure they are part of all efforts. So I urge United Nations Member States to make sure that their foreign assistance programmes include measures to prevent and respond to violence against women and children and to ensure that women are included in designing and implementing those programmes. In his speech to the General Assembly last week, President Obama challenged nations of the world to assume responsibility for the challenges confronting us.  Certainly, the challenge of sexual violence in conflict cannot and should not be separated from the broader security issues confronting the Council. It is time for all of us to assume our responsibility to go beyond condemning this behaviour and take concrete steps to end it, to make it socially unacceptable, to recognize that it is not cultural; it is criminal. And the more we say that, over and over and over again, the more we will change attitudes and create peer pressure and the conditions for the elimination of this violation.  When I was in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, I was told of an old proverb that says, ""No matter how long the night, the day is sure to come"". Well, I hope our work today, and every day going forward, will hasten the time when thousands of women around the world will be able to feel comfortable in walking the streets of their cities and villages freely again, to work outside their homes, collect firewood and water without fear, play with their children, spend time with their husbands and enjoy all the blessings of life in freedom, peace and security.  That is our dream for a better future for them and for us, and I thank this body for the strong commitment that this resolution represents.  I now resume my functions as President of the Council. I kind of like being a president, so this may go on a little longer than anticipated.  I now invite the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, to take the floor.

In favour: Austria, Burkina Faso, China, Costa Rica, Croatia, France, Japan, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Mexico, Russian Federation, Turkey, Uganda, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America, Viet Nam   The President: There were 15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as resolution 1888 (2009).  I now have the privilege of making a statement in my capacity as Secretary of State of the United States of America.  I am very grateful to speak before the Security Council on this important issue. I want to thank everyone who has worked very hard to reach this point 09-53396 on this resolution and, of course, to have it adopted unanimously. We are here to address an issue that has received too little attention, not only in this Chamber over the past six decades, but also, I would suggest, in all of our halls of Government across the world. It is an important issue that goes to the core of our commitment to ensure the safety of the United Nations Member States and their citizens.  Under the United Nations Charter, the 15 members of this Council bear primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. Satisfying that responsibility includes our protecting the lives and physical security of all people, including the women who comprise half the planet's population. This responsibility is particularly acute in circumstances where peace and stability are challenged.  Even though women and children are rarely responsible for initiating armed conflict, they are often war's most vulnerable and violated victims. The resolution we have adopted today represents a step forward in our global efforts to end violence perpetrated against women and children in conflict zones, and it builds on two prior Security Council resolutions - resolution 1325 (2000), which calls on all parties in conflicts to respect women's rights and increase their participation in peace negotiations and post-conflict reconstruction efforts; and resolution 1820 (2008), which affirms the ambitions set out in resolution 1325 (2000) and establishes a clear link between maintaining international peace and security and preventing and responding to sexual violence used as a tactic of war to target civilians. Yet, despite these actions by the Security Council, violence against women and girls in conflict-related situations has not diminished; in fact, in some cases it has escalated.  Reading the headlines, one might think that the use of rape as a tactic of war happens only occasionally or in a few places, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo or the Sudan. That would be bad enough, but the reality is much worse. We have seen rape used as a tactic of war before in Bosnia, Burma, Sri Lanka and elsewhere. In too many countries and in too many cases, the perpetrators of this violence are not punished, and so this impunity encourages further attacks.  Last month, I travelled to Goma in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, where over 1,100 09-53396  rapes are reported every month. I met with survivors of sexual violence, and the physical and emotional damage to individual women and their families from these attacks cannot be quantified, nor can the toll on their societies. The dehumanizing nature of sexual violence does not harm just a single individual, a single family or even a single village or a single group; it shreds the fabric that weaves us together as human beings. It endangers families and communities, erodes social and political stability, and undermines economic progress. We need to understand that it holds all of us back.  Also, our failure as an international body to respond concretely to this global problem erodes our collective effectiveness. So we must act now to end this crisis, not only to protect vulnerable people and promote human security, but also to uphold the legitimacy of this body.  The international community has made progress. Many peacekeeping mandates now include Security Council requests for strengthened measures to prevent and respond to sexual violence. In Chad and the Sudan, United Nations peacekeepers have clear instructions underscoring their responsibility to protect local populations against sexual and gender-based violence. I recently met with United Nations troops in Liberia, who provide an excellent example of the steps a United Nations mission can take, both through its own actions and in cooperation with the host Government, to prevent violence against women and girls. It is also very important that the United Nations Mission in Liberia includes an all-women police unit from India. That all-women police unit has helped to motivate more Liberian women to become police officers, and the Mission has launched a joint United Nations- Liberian campaign against rape.  These steps are essential but, alone, they are not sufficient. Resolution 1888 (2009) identifies specific steps that the United Nations and Member States can and should take to improve the Organization's response to sexual violence committed during situations of armed conflict. It calls on the Secretary-General to appoint a special representative to lead, coordinate and advocate efforts to end sexual violence. We expect that person to engage at high levels with civilian and military leaders to spearhead the United Nations activities on this front. It also calls on the Secretary- General to rapidly deploy a team of experts to work with Governments to strengthen the rule of law, 3 address impunity and enhance accountability, while drawing attention to the full range of legal venues that can be brought into play, including domestic, international and mixed courts that bring local and international judges and prosecutors together to strengthen local justice systems.  We must also recognize that ending conflicts outright is the most certain path to ending sexual violence in conflicts. So pursuing peace and successful post-conflict transitions should be our highest priority. In States where conflict is taking place and in those that are moving beyond it, local police must receive better training, the rule of law must be strengthened, and survivors must be ensured full access to justice and protection throughout the judicial process. We envision that the team of experts called for in the resolution will help us to strengthen initiatives like those.  Beyond the measures outlined in the resolution, the Security Council should take additional steps. Protecting women and children should be a critical priority for all troops who wear the blue helmet. To reflect this, new and renewed peacekeeping mandates should include language condemning sexual violence and giving further guidance to peacekeeping missions to work with local authorities to end it. We must seek to ensure that our respective military and police forces, especially those that will participate in peacekeeping missions, develop the expertise to prevent and respond to violence against women and children. This will be helped by increasing the number of women who serve in United Nations peacekeeping missions. When I visited the Mission in Goma, I was very impressed at how integrated it was in every way - staff from every country, every kind of person represented, and many women in the leadership as well as in the ranks.  Let us not forget that it is often women who lead the call for peace in communities shattered by violence. We have seen women in this role from Liberia, Rwanda and Northern Ireland to Guatemala. Even when they suffer terrible losses in conflicts they had no part in starting, women have the will to reach across divisions, find common ground and foster understanding. As they seek peace, so must we by making sure they are part of all efforts. So I urge United Nations Member States to make sure that their foreign assistance programmes include measures to prevent and respond to violence against women and children and to ensure that women are included in designing and implementing those programmes. In his speech to the General Assembly last week, President Obama challenged nations of the world to assume responsibility for the challenges confronting us.  Certainly, the challenge of sexual violence in conflict cannot and should not be separated from the broader security issues confronting the Council. It is time for all of us to assume our responsibility to go beyond condemning this behaviour and take concrete steps to end it, to make it socially unacceptable, to recognize that it is not cultural; it is criminal. And the more we say that, over and over and over again, the more we will change attitudes and create peer pressure and the conditions for the elimination of this violation.  When I was in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, I was told of an old proverb that says, ""No matter how long the night, the day is sure to come"". Well, I hope our work today, and every day going forward, will hasten the time when thousands of women around the world will be able to feel comfortable in walking the streets of their cities and villages freely again, to work outside their homes, collect firewood and water without fear, play with their children, spend time with their husbands and enjoy all the blessings of life in freedom, peace and security.  That is our dream for a better future for them and for us, and I thank this body for the strong commitment that this resolution represents.  I now resume my functions as President of the Council. I kind of like being a president, so this may go on a little longer than anticipated.  I now invite the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, to take the floor.   "

UNSC_2009_SPV.6196_spch024.txt,2009,6196,"The President: I shall now make a statement in my capacity as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Viet Nam.  This debate is of great significance in preparing for the review of 10 years of the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, adopted by the Security Council in 2000. That resolution has the profoundly humane objective of protecting women and children, including girls, who are the most vulnerable and most heavily affected in conflicts and wars. It is also aimed at promoting more effective implementation of the Council's primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.  Viet Nam values the support of Council members for its proposal that this debate be convened on the need to protect the rights of women and girls and to promote the role of women in post-conflict situations. With this debate, United Nations Members, international organizations and other stakeholders will jointly take stock of and set out measures to enhance the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). In preparing for this undertaking, Viet Nam and Switzerland jointly organized a seminar on women, peace, security and development, held in Hanoi in July 2009, with the participation of United Nations representatives and Vietnamese and international non-governmental organizations.  The enormous international efforts, including those of the United Nations, to promote the implementation of resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) and of the relevant presidential statements of the Security Council have produced positive results. Of primary significance is the greater recognition that the maintenance of peace and security requires measures to meet the needs of women. It is also necessary to ensure their full and equal participation in reconciliation and negotiation processes, in all stages of peacekeeping, in the management of humanitarian aid and in post- conflict reconstruction.  Activities carried out by the United Nations and by many countries have brought about noticeable changes in a number of specific areas. However, there are problems and challenges, especially in the post- conflict period. This includes women's limited contributions to peacebuilding owing to the lack of opportunities for their participation in policymaking and to the shortage of financial resources required for an effective response to their pressing needs.  In order to achieve tangible results, resolution 1325 (2000), resolution 1820 (2008) and resolution 1888 (2009), which was just adopted on 30 September, should be implemented in a coherent and comprehensive manner. Viet Nam supports the Secretary-General's recommendations included in his report to the Council dated 16 September 2009 (S/2009/465) and shares many of the views expressed during this debate.  From our own experience in dealing with the multifaceted consequences of war and in promoting national development and the rights of women and children, Viet Nam underlines the following points.  First, we need to fully recognize the primacy of eliminating the causes of conflicts and preventing and peacefully resolving international disputes. Measures to protect the rights of women and girls must be combined with promotion of their role in ending  conflicts and in post-conflict reconstruction. The early integration of their priorities into the reconstruction efforts will create favourable preconditions for the coherent and long-term implementation of the necessary measures.  Secondly, the reconstruction process requires comprehensive efforts to meet people's basic needs in food, housing, health care, education, dealing with psychological shocks, restoration of infrastructure and consolidation of social institutions, including the important role of the family. The State and society need to pay full attention to both civilian women and those who served in armed forces or were otherwise involved in military activities.  Thirdly, the United Nations system has a special role to play in conflict settlement and post-conflict reconstruction, as mandated by the Member States. It has gained experience and knowledge in various fields. It is essential to promote local governments and people's ownership. Assistance may take different forms depending on the specific conditions of each country. It is necessary to have close coordination among United Nations bodies and between the United Nations and other partners.  In 1977, shortly after the end of the war and national reunification, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 32/3 to call on countries and international organizations to help Viet Nam in its reconstruction efforts. In the past 30 years, the United Nations and other international organizations and countries have effectively carried out many development projects to assist Viet Nam, including those aimed at meeting the basic needs of women and ensuring their equal participation in all aspects of socio-political life in Viet Nam. On behalf of the Government and people of Viet Nam, I take this opportunity to express our deep gratitude to the United Nations and countries and development partners for their valuable support in the processes of healing the war wounds and of reform and development.  As a nation having experienced untold losses caused by wars, Viet Nam always supports the common efforts of the international community to prevent wars and protect peace. This is also the consistent guiding principle of Viet Nam in its participation in the work of the Security Council. With that spirit, we are ready to share experience and play an active role in the undertaking that we are discussing today. I now resume my function as President of the Council.  I give the floor to the representative of Liechtenstein.  ",The President,,English,u," I shall now make a statement in my capacity as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Viet Nam.  This debate is of great significance in preparing for the review of 10 years of the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, adopted by the Security Council in 2000. That resolution has the profoundly humane objective of protecting women and children, including girls, who are the most vulnerable and most heavily affected in conflicts and wars. It is also aimed at promoting more effective implementation of the Council's primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.  Viet Nam values the support of Council members for its proposal that this debate be convened on the need to protect the rights of women and girls and to promote the role of women in post-conflict situations. With this debate, United Nations Members, international organizations and other stakeholders will jointly take stock of and set out measures to enhance the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). In preparing for this undertaking, Viet Nam and Switzerland jointly organized a seminar on women, peace, security and development, held in Hanoi in July 2009, with the participation of United Nations representatives and Vietnamese and international non-governmental organizations.  The enormous international efforts, including those of the United Nations, to promote the implementation of resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) and of the relevant presidential statements of the Security Council have produced positive results. Of primary significance is the greater recognition that the maintenance of peace and security requires measures to meet the needs of women. It is also necessary to ensure their full and equal participation in reconciliation and negotiation processes, in all stages of peacekeeping, in the management of humanitarian aid and in post- conflict reconstruction.  Activities carried out by the United Nations and by many countries have brought about noticeable changes in a number of specific areas. However, there are problems and challenges, especially in the post- conflict period. This includes women's limited contributions to peacebuilding owing to the lack of opportunities for their participation in policymaking and to the shortage of financial resources required for an effective response to their pressing needs.  In order to achieve tangible results, resolution 1325 (2000), resolution 1820 (2008) and resolution 1888 (2009), which was just adopted on 30 September, should be implemented in a coherent and comprehensive manner. Viet Nam supports the Secretary-General's recommendations included in his report to the Council dated 16 September 2009 (S/2009/465) and shares many of the views expressed during this debate.  From our own experience in dealing with the multifaceted consequences of war and in promoting national development and the rights of women and children, Viet Nam underlines the following points.  First, we need to fully recognize the primacy of eliminating the causes of conflicts and preventing and peacefully resolving international disputes. Measures to protect the rights of women and girls must be combined with promotion of their role in ending  conflicts and in post-conflict reconstruction. The early integration of their priorities into the reconstruction efforts will create favourable preconditions for the coherent and long-term implementation of the necessary measures.  Secondly, the reconstruction process requires comprehensive efforts to meet people's basic needs in food, housing, health care, education, dealing with psychological shocks, restoration of infrastructure and consolidation of social institutions, including the important role of the family. The State and society need to pay full attention to both civilian women and those who served in armed forces or were otherwise involved in military activities.  Thirdly, the United Nations system has a special role to play in conflict settlement and post-conflict reconstruction, as mandated by the Member States. It has gained experience and knowledge in various fields. It is essential to promote local governments and people's ownership. Assistance may take different forms depending on the specific conditions of each country. It is necessary to have close coordination among United Nations bodies and between the United Nations and other partners.  In 1977, shortly after the end of the war and national reunification, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 32/3 to call on countries and international organizations to help Viet Nam in its reconstruction efforts. In the past 30 years, the United Nations and other international organizations and countries have effectively carried out many development projects to assist Viet Nam, including those aimed at meeting the basic needs of women and ensuring their equal participation in all aspects of socio-political life in Viet Nam. On behalf of the Government and people of Viet Nam, I take this opportunity to express our deep gratitude to the United Nations and countries and development partners for their valuable support in the processes of healing the war wounds and of reform and development.  As a nation having experienced untold losses caused by wars, Viet Nam always supports the common efforts of the international community to prevent wars and protect peace. This is also the consistent guiding principle of Viet Nam in its participation in the work of the Security Council. With that spirit, we are ready to share experience and play an active role in the undertaking that we are discussing today. I now resume my function as President of the Council.  I give the floor to the representative of Liechtenstein.  "

I join previous speakers and my colleagues in thanking Special Representative Margot Wallstrom and Special Adviser Rachel Mayanja for their very helpful briefings.  First of all, I would like to congratulate Ms. Wallstrom on her appointment as the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, and to express Japan's full support as she fulfils her heavy responsibilities. Japan attaches great importance to her mandate to provide coherent and strategic leadership and advocacy efforts on this important issue. We wish the Special Representative to focus particularly on activities related to the impact on women and girls on the ground. Therefore, we highly appreciate Ms. Wallstrom's first visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where she not only met high-level officials, but also heard the voices of survivors of sexual violence. However, it is important that her visit be followed up by necessary measures, including a possible deployment of a team of experts to strengthen capacity for ending impunity in the country.  Secondly, we support the five-point priority agenda set by Ms. Wallstrom. The protection of women should go hand in hand with empowering them, which is a concept emphasized in the human security approach that Japan has been advocating. We hope that the Special Representative will place a high priority on women's empowerment by focusing on the needs of individuals and communities in order to enhance their resilience and preventive capacity.  Thirdly, it is important to address the gap that exists in the United Nations system in monitoring and reporting on sexual violence. We look forward to the Secretary-General's specific proposal in this regard. Performance benchmarks should be developed, taking into account ongoing processes, such as global indicators in the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), as well as the listing of criteria for parties that have committed sexual violence against children.  Japan also welcomes Ms. Mayanja's briefing and timely submission of the report of the Secretary- General (S/2010/173) on the set of indicators for tracking implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). We highly commend Ms. Mayanja's leadership and the work of the Technical Working Group. I would like to make three brief points on the indicators.  First, we appreciate the efforts of the Secretariat to develop a comprehensive set of indicators that cover all areas of resolution 1325 (2000). The 26 indicators in four areas proposed in the report are interrelated. Some of the indicators can be implemented without much delay, but some others require two to five years, we understand, for technical development reasons before becoming operational. Therefore, it is important for the Secretary-General to set out a so-called road map for making each indicator operational, in consultation with relevant stakeholders.  Secondly, the Security Council should mobilize political will on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) to approve a comprehensive set of indicators on that occasion. Thereafter, the Security Council would request the use of indicators in country and thematic reports and invite Member States to use indicators in their efforts to implement resolution 1325 (2000).  Lastly, there is synergy here. Indicators were requested by resolution 1889 (2009) at last year's Council debate on the specific needs of women and girls in armed conflict and post-conflict situations (see S/PV.6196). Therefore, we believe that the indicators will serve for early warning in peacebuilding activities to prevent the recurrence of conflict, and thereby contribute to the work of the Peacebuilding Commission. I resume my functions as the President of the  Security Council.  After consultations among members of the  Council, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:  ""The Security Council welcomes the appointment of Margot Wallstrom as Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict and reiterates its support of her mandate as outlined in resolution 1888 (2009).

""The Security Council notes that indicators contained in the report would need technical and conceptual development before they could become operational.  ""The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to continue to consult with the Security Council, taking into account views expressed by other relevant stakeholders, including the broader United Nations membership, taking into account the need to further develop indicators contained in his report (S/2010/l73), and the parallel ongoing work regarding resolution 1888 (2009), in order to include a comprehensive set of indicators in his next report on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) to be submitted to the Security Council in October 2010, as well as a programme of work containing roles and responsibilities vis- a-vis the indicators within the United Nations system and a time frame to render the indicators operational.  ""The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to continue to ensure that all country reports to the Security Council provide information on the impact of situations of armed conflict on women and girls, their particular needs in post-conflict situations and obstacles to attaining those needs.  ""The Security Council expresses its intention to take action on a comprehensive set of indicators on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of its resolution 1325 (2000) in October 2010, for use at the global level to track implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  ""The Security Council reiterates its desire to commemorate the tenth anniversary of its resolution 1325 (2000).""

I thank the Secretary-General for his statement and the Chairperson of the Peacebuilding Commission for his briefing. We welcome the increasing emphasis on ensuring that peacebuilding activities, especially in post-conflict situations, are nationally owned and carried out in a more coordinated, more coherent and more effective way. Peacebuilding is premised on the need to address the root causes of conflict as well as developing national institutions and conditions that are conducive to sustainable peace and development.  The report of the Secretary-General on peacebuilding in the immediate aftermath of conflict (S/2010/386) has highlighted a number of areas in which progress is being made towards improving United Nations peacebuilding efforts. We particularly welcome the increasing engagement with national authorities on peacebuilding priorities, support for national capacity and development, and improving the mobilization of resources for peacebuilding.  As the Secretary-General notes in his report, there is still a lot of work to be done. It is therefore essential that the United Nations and the wider international community intensify efforts towards a more effective and coherent approach to peacebuilding, with an emphasis on delivering an impact on the ground. There is a need for focusing more on delivering tangible dividends, including provision of basic services and improvement of the standard of living of the population. It is also important to strengthen partnerships amongst Member States, regional and subregional organizations, international financial institutions and other actors, since peacebuilding is a collective effort.  My delegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on women's participation in peacebuilding (S/2010/466). The report is comprehensive, and its action plan contains very useful recommendations whose implementation, as appropriate, will reinforce the overall agenda for action to improve United Nations peacebuilding efforts.  Uganda reiterates the importance of women's equal participation and full involvement in peacebuilding, including in the development and implementation of post-conflict strategies. The engagement of all relevant United Nations agencies, including the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), as well as other actors, in the consideration and implementation of the action plan will be critical.

I wish to draw the attention of Council members to document S/2010/498, which contains the report of the Secretary-General on women and peace and security. I also wish to draw members' attention to document S/2010/466, which contains the report of the Secretary-General on women's participation in peacekeeping.  This year marks the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the landmark resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security. It was the first Security Council resolution to address women's issues on the international peace and security agenda. Member States, the United Nations system, civil society and parties to conflict were called upon, among other things, to acknowledge the role and address the plight of women in situations of armed conflict. Resolution 1325 (2000) also sought to protect women and girls from violence, particularly sexual violence, in conflict and post-conflict situations.  Uganda recognizes the progress that has been made by the United Nations and the broader international community towards enhancing the participation of women in conflict resolution, peace processes and post-conflict reconstruction. However, there are still situations in which conflict continues to have a devastating impact on women and girls.  As we commemorate the tenth anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000), Uganda will move beyond the reaffirmation of our common commitment to the implementation of the resolution and make strong, 10-60258  time-bound and measurable commitments to action. It is essential to empower women to enable them to participate effectively in issues of peace, security and development. The Government of Uganda has adopted a deliberate policy for the empowerment of women through affirmative action initiatives. These include providing for one woman representative per district in Parliament and for a third of local council executive positions to be occupied by women, and awarding 1.5 additional points to female candidates for admission to public universities, as well as ensuring universal primary and secondary education for all children. Through these initiatives, women's participation in governance has been greatly enhanced.  Uganda launched its national action plan for resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008), as well as the Goma Declaration in December 2008. The action plan highlights specific commitments and duties of the Government and stakeholders and identifies priority interventions for the short and medium terms. It also apportions institutional responsibilities and establishes a mechanism for coordination, monitoring and reporting.  In the next five years, Uganda will be developing a comprehensive national policy on gender-based violence to guide prevention and responsiveness in all situations, including in the humanitarian development context. We shall establish sustainable and integrated systems for collecting data on gender-based violence and improve access to justice for victims and survivors. We are also institutionalizing gender-based violence training in key institutions for training security forces, including those involved in peacekeeping missions. Uganda is already carrying out wide-ranging reforms to address the remaining gender inequalities and violence against women in both the public and the private sectors. We are also working on integrating the principles of resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) into the implementation, monitoring and evaluation processes for our national development plan.  At the regional level, through the African Union, the East African Community and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, Uganda is committed to strengthening collaboration to enhance women's participation and empowerment in conflict prevention, mediation and resolution. We are convinced that women have an important role in ensuring durable peace, security and development. 3  The Council has before it the text of a statement by the President on behalf of the Council on the subject of today's meeting. I thank Council members for their valuable contributions to this statement. In accordance with the understanding reached among the members of the Council, I shall take it that the members of the Security Council agree to the statement, which will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2010/22.

It is so decided.  On behalf of the Council, I wish to warmly welcome the Deputy Secretary-General at this meeting.  The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.  I wish to draw the attention of Council members to document S/2010/498, which contains the report of the Secretary-General on women and peace and security. I also wish to draw members' attention to document S/2010/466, which contains the report of the Secretary-General on women's participation in peacekeeping.  This year marks the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the landmark resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security. It was the first Security Council resolution to address women's issues on the international peace and security agenda. Member States, the United Nations system, civil society and parties to conflict were called upon, among other things, to acknowledge the role and address the plight of women in situations of armed conflict. Resolution 1325 (2000) also sought to protect women and girls from violence, particularly sexual violence, in conflict and post-conflict situations.  Uganda recognizes the progress that has been made by the United Nations and the broader international community towards enhancing the participation of women in conflict resolution, peace processes and post-conflict reconstruction. However, there are still situations in which conflict continues to have a devastating impact on women and girls.  As we commemorate the tenth anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000), Uganda will move beyond the reaffirmation of our common commitment to the implementation of the resolution and make strong, 10-60258  time-bound and measurable commitments to action. It is essential to empower women to enable them to participate effectively in issues of peace, security and development. The Government of Uganda has adopted a deliberate policy for the empowerment of women through affirmative action initiatives. These include providing for one woman representative per district in Parliament and for a third of local council executive positions to be occupied by women, and awarding 1.5 additional points to female candidates for admission to public universities, as well as ensuring universal primary and secondary education for all children. Through these initiatives, women's participation in governance has been greatly enhanced.  Uganda launched its national action plan for resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008), as well as the Goma Declaration in December 2008. The action plan highlights specific commitments and duties of the Government and stakeholders and identifies priority interventions for the short and medium terms. It also apportions institutional responsibilities and establishes a mechanism for coordination, monitoring and reporting.  In the next five years, Uganda will be developing a comprehensive national policy on gender-based violence to guide prevention and responsiveness in all situations, including in the humanitarian development context. We shall establish sustainable and integrated systems for collecting data on gender-based violence and improve access to justice for victims and survivors. We are also institutionalizing gender-based violence training in key institutions for training security forces, including those involved in peacekeeping missions. Uganda is already carrying out wide-ranging reforms to address the remaining gender inequalities and violence against women in both the public and the private sectors. We are also working on integrating the principles of resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) into the implementation, monitoring and evaluation processes for our national development plan.  At the regional level, through the African Union, the East African Community and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, Uganda is committed to strengthening collaboration to enhance women's participation and empowerment in conflict prevention, mediation and resolution. We are convinced that women have an important role in ensuring durable peace, security and development. 3  The Council has before it the text of a statement by the President on behalf of the Council on the subject of today's meeting.

UNSC_2010_SPV.6453_spch024.txt,2010,6453,"The President: I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of the United States.  Let me begin by thanking the Secretary-General, Special Representative Wallstrom, Under-Secretary- General Le Roy and Lieutenant General Gaye for their very powerful and insightful briefings. I also want to thank my colleagues on the Council for their very strong statements of support for resolution 1960 (2010), just adopted, as well as for the broad goals of fighting sexual violence and the rape of women around the world.  We are gathered because we all agree on the importance of addressing an issue that cries out for the world's conscience, and that is sexual violence in conflict. We agree that the challenge is urgent and immense. The human cost is all too real. Armed  conflicts continue to have a devastating impact, particularly on women and girls. Rape, sexual assault and gender-based violence are all too often used deliberately and cynically as weapons of war, and the fight to end sexual violence has yet to be universally recognized as central to securing international peace and security.  Some still think that sexual violence is somehow a natural accompaniment of conflict. It is not. As the Secretary-General's report notes,  ""The myth that rape is an inevitable by- product of war is persistent and dangerously self- fulfilling"" (S/2010/604, para. 7).  I hope that this meeting, in some small way, will help put an end to that myth and channel our shared commitment to confronting and combating sexual violence into concrete actions that improve the fate of women and girls.  The United States commends the United Nations, especially United Nations Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict, for its leadership in finding effective ways to address this problem. We have been encouraged by the United Nations response and follow- up to the appalling August attacks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including the additional steps it has taken to build mission-wide strategies to better protect civilians. The United Nations has increased random patrols, recruited more female peacekeepers and improved communications. It is also employing scenario-based training for peacekeepers to help combat sexual violence.  But obviously, more must still be done. We hope that the United Nations will continue to identify women's protection advisers and put them in more peacekeeping operations, and complete a gaps analysis of United Nations protection strategies.  In her brief tenure so far, Special Representative Wallstrom has brought leadership, passion and clarity to efforts to end impunity for the heinous crimes of sexual violence in conflict zones. She is playing a vital role in the United Nations efforts to support the response of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the horrifying mass rapes in Walikale, which has included the arrest of one of the perpetrators. The United States fully supports Special Representative Wallstrom in her work, and we encourage our fellow Member States to consider additional voluntary contributions to support her mandate. We particularly hope that the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law will become a valuable tool in helping Member States develop appropriate judicial responses to sexual violence in conflict.  Data collection is also vital for non-humanitarian activities to prevent and respond to gender-based violence. The resolution we adopted today will improve the collection and analysis of information required to better understand the patterns of sexual violence in armed conflict. Of course, better information by itself will not halt sexual violence, but it will inform our decisions as a Council and as Member States, and bring us one step closer to our ultimate goal.  We must also shine the international spotlight on the perpetrators and use this mechanism to inform targeted actions by the Council and by Member States. With improved information, the United Nations will be able to assist States in responding more robustly to these crimes. As in the Democratic Republic of the Congo after the Walikale rapes, we expect our actions to spur commanding officers to turn those who commit sexual violence over to the authorities to be brought to justice.  Finally, we cannot separate the challenge of sexual violence from the broader security issues facing the Council. Resolution 1960 (2010), its predecessors and our follow-up actions must send a clear message. We do not just condemn sexual violence and rape as weapons of war, but we are taking concrete steps to end it. We are working to make clear that rape and sexual violence are unacceptable and that perpetrators will face consequences. Our shared responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security includes a profound responsibility to safeguard the lives and the security of women and girls, who make up at least half of humankind.

UNSC_2011_SPV.6642_spch024.txt,2011,6642,"The President: I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Nigeria.  I would like to convey the appreciation of my delegation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for taking time out of his busy schedule to attend this meeting to brief the Council on the important issue of women and peace and security. His report (S/2011/598*) and his comments here today provide the appropriate foundation on which to anchor our debate. I would also like to thank Ambassador Lazarus Kapambwe, President of the Economic and Social Council, Ms. Michelle Bachelet, Executive-Director of UN-Women, and Ms. Orzala Ashraf Nemat, of the NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security, for their very instructive briefings.  Although Ms. Bachelet aptly highlighted the modest progress made by Member States and the United Nations in advancing the agenda of resolution 1325 (2000), we must heed her warning that we are very far from sufficiently and systematically integrating women into the process of conflict prevention and peacebuilding. We believe that this is an auspicious moment in the history of the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). The draft presidential statement that is to be adopted today could not have come at a better time, coming as it does in the aftermath of the recognition by the Nobel Committee of the role and participation of the three eminent women in conflict resolution and peace processes in their respective communities. While congratulating President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, Ms. Leymah Gbowee and Ms. Tawakkul Karman for their groundbreaking achievement, we share the hope of the Nobel Committee that this recognition of the important place of women in the peace process, which the draft presidential statement echoes loudly, is a watershed moment and paradigm shift in the global effort to implement resolution 1325 (2000).  We note with satisfaction that the draft presidential statement accords with the theme of this open debate, namely, ""The role and participation of women in conflict prevention and mediation"". Through the draft presidential statement, the Council recognizes that women can, and do, play crucial roles in the prevention of conflict. Nevertheless, it also notes that more needs to be done to create the enabling conditions for the participation of women in all stages of the peace process.  Such efforts at creating the right conditions for ensuring women's full participation should include increasing the participation and representation of women in preventive diplomacy initiatives. It should also include strengthening the capacities of the relevant Government institutions and women's organizations involved with conflict and post-conflict issues, the adequate representation of women in the negotiation and implementation of peace agreements, support for local women's peace initiatives, the promotion and protection of the human rights of women, higher levels of representation in decision-making roles, and ensuring proper coherence and coordination among the United Nations entities responsible for implementing the women, peace and security agenda in the entire United Nations system.  On the subject of United Nations coherence and effectiveness in particular, we recognize the important and central role of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), working in close partnership and collaboration with the Special Representatives of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict and for Children and Armed Conflict, respectively. The gaps and challenges hindering the full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) are indeed substantial. National, regional and international actors must rededicate themselves to addressing them. We believe that developing and implementing national action plans constitutes a viable strategy for fulfilling the obligations under resolution 1325 (2000).  As a signatory to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Dakar Declaration, Nigeria has committed itself to accelerating the national and regional implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). The Declaration calls for a regional action plan within ECOWAS to support national action plans. ECOWAS will coordinate and collaborate with the United Nations Office in West Africa and with UN-Women in this process.  Nigeria is also committed to fulfilling its obligations under the African Charter of Human and Peoples' Rights on the rights of women in Africa. As Ms. Bachelet has often said, the obstacles to women's political participation, which I believe have a direct bearing on their capacity to play an active role in preventive diplomacy and conflict prevention, are indeed enormous. Violence, poverty, lack of access to education and health care, and limited economic opportunities all combine to undermine the role of women and girls in conflict prevention, peace negotiations and peacebuilding. It is therefore necessary that we develop and take measures to address these inherent obstacles.  Promoting women's equality and empowerment is, in our view, one of the best ways to address the root causes of conflict and therefore prevent such conflict. I envisage a presidential statement along those lines in the near future.  We recognize the relevance and relationship between the Council's preventive diplomacy initiatives and its women, peace and security agenda. As women are usually some of the first and worst hit in any conflict, preventing conflicts from breaking out serves to ensure the peace and security of women and girls. Even as we all remain true to the provisions of resolution 1325 (2000), which focuses on armed conflict and post-conflict situations, it has become imperative to devote equal attention to conflict- prevention strategies, including the use of preventive diplomacy. It is gratifying to know that the Council has the opportunity every year to review the progress made in implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). We look forward to the inclusion in next year's report of the Secretary-General of, among other things, specific actions and achievements as well as the challenges faced in the implementation of the presidential statement that we will be adopting later today.  We also look forward to the high-level review to be held in 2015 on the progress made in the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), confident that this and future presidential statements and initiatives of the Council will play pivotal roles in national, regional and global strategies on the women, peace and security agenda.  I now resume my functions as President of the Council.  The Council has before it the text of a draft statement by the President on behalf of the Council on the subject of today's meeting. I wish to thank Council members for their valuable contributions to this statement.

UNSC_2012_SPV.6722_spch022.txt,2012,6722,"The President (spoke in French): I will now address the Council in my capacity as the representative of Togo.  I would like first to join previous speakers in thanking the Secretary-General for his report (S/2012/33) on conflict-related sexual violence. I would also like to thank Ms. Margot Wallstrom for her praiseworthy work on the issue and Mr. Herve Ladsous for the useful efforts that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) continues to make in this sphere. I would further like to thank to the representative of the NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security for her organization's cutting-edge work to combat violence against women and girls.  United Nations efforts to eradicate sexual violence in armed conflict deserve recognition, as they make an important contribution to restoring peace and security in countries in conflict and to the essential process of reconciliation. Indeed, the suffering inflicted on women and girls in armed conflict and post-conflict situations remains a source of serious concern insofar as it undermines the process of reconciliation. Sexual violence is manifested in rape, sexual slavery, prostitution, pregnancy, forced sterilization and any other form of sexual violence of comparable seriousness. Such acts, committed in conflict or post-conflict situations or in other crisis situations, constitute serious violations of human rights and are all the more deplorable for their impact on people who are already vulnerable.  My country welcomed the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), which defines the role of women in conflict prevention, conflict management and peacebuilding. The national action plans that Member States are called upon to draw up pursuant to that resolution seem to be the most effective means for attaining the goals of the resolution. In that spirit, Togo has drafted an action plan to combat all forms of violence against women. My country has established nationwide support centres for women victims of violence. For 10 years now, my country has also participated in 16 days of campaigning organized from 25 November to 10 December every year. As a troop-contributing country to United Nations peacekeeping operations, Togo has also created a predeployment centre where military and police personnel in training are made aware of the strict prohibition of all forms of sexual violence.  In addition to those measures, which are aimed at preventing violence against women in conflict, my country reiterates the urgent need to put an end to impunity if we are to ensure that every society in the thrall of conflict, wherever it may be, draws lessons from the atrocities committed against civilians and prevents such atrocities from being repeated. In that regard, Togo welcomes the steps taken by the Secretary-General to ensure that the zero-tolerance policy regarding exploitation and sexual violence in United Nations peacekeeping operations, in conformity with paragraph 7 of resolution 1820 (2008), does not remain an empty term.  My country also supports the main initiatives launched by the United Nations to combat sexual violence in times of conflict, as set out in the report. These efforts include scenario-based predeployment training modules on preventing and addressing conflict-related sexual violence; analysis of early warning signs of sexual Violence in times of conflict, with the aim of integrating that analysis into existing and emerging early warning and prevention systems to facilitate a rapid response; and addressing conflict- related sexual violence in ceasefire and peace agreements.  To combat and especially to deter the perpetration of such acts, Togo believes that the countries concerned must build an arsenal of justice, such as national or hybrid criminal courts and tribunals, turning, if necessary to the International Criminal Court, with scrupulous respect for the principle of complementarity, which maintains the primacy of national jurisdictions. My country also believes that the affected countries could resort to extrajudicial mechanisms and methods of reconciliation, that is, to truth, justice and reconciliation commissions and roundtables. These  mechanisms can help not only to solidify the principle of the individual responsibility of perpetrators of serious crimes, but also to promote peace, truth, reconciliation and the rights of victims.  In conclusion, I wish to reiterate Togo's support for the presidential statement to be adopted at the conclusion of this debate. My country wishes to renew its thanks to the United States delegation for its work in that regard.  I now resume my function as President of the Council.  I remind speakers that they are asked to limit their statements to a maximum of four minutes so that the Council may complete its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate their texts and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.

At the outset, I would like to thank the Deputy Secretary-General for his remarks at this important open debate under the agenda item on women and peace and security. The fact that more than 50 countries have expressed their interest in speaking in today's debate reflects the importance and resonance of this issue.  I would also like to thank the Under-Secretary- General and Executive Director of UN-Women, Ms. Michelle Bachelet, and the Under-Secretary- General for Peacekeeping Operations, Mr. Herve Ladsous, for their detailed briefings. I also thank Ms. Bineta Diop, President ofFemmes Africa Solidarite, for sharing their insights, and other Council members for their contributions to this debate.  Resolution 1325 (2000) highlights the impact of armed conflict on women and the need for effective institutional arrangements to guarantee their protection and full participation in peace processes. India has consistently held that the greater participation of women in the areas of conflict resolution, peace negotiations, peacekeeping and post-conflict reconstruction is a sine qua non for lasting peace and security.  My full statement is being circulated, and I shall therefore, in the interest of the efficient and effective use of time, merely make a few remarks by way of conclusion.  The promotion and protection of the human rights of women and girls in armed conflict continues to pose a pressing challenge. There should be zero tolerance for gender-based violence. All cases of gender-based violence must be promptly investigated and the perpetrators prosecuted. We agree with those who call for the increased deployment of female military and police personnel in United Nations peacekeeping operations and for appropriate training to enable them to effectively discharge their responsibilities.  India is the largest troop-contributing country in United Nations history. India was the first country to deploy a full female peacekeeping unit of 100 personnel in Liberia, in 2007. We have offered to contribute more such units. We are very proud of the exemplary record of our peacekeepers, both men and women, in the protection of women, children and the weak in conflict situations.  In conclusion, let me reaffirm India's commitment to positively contribute to United Nations efforts in the area of women and peace and security. We also see civil society and local communities as valued partners in that endeavour.  I appeal to speakers to limit their statements to four minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements, like the delegation of India, are requested to circulate the text in writing and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.

UNSC_2013_SPV.6948_spch022.txt,2013,6948,"The President: I shall now make a statement in my national capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Rwanda.  It is a great honour for me to be here today and to preside over this important open debate on women and peace and security, and sexual violence in conflict. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Secretary-General and his Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict forjoining us today.  I also welcome the presence of the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Norway, the First Lady and Ministerial Secretary for Social Inclusion of El Salvador, as well as Ms. Saran Keita Diakite, representative of the NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security.  Rwanda commends the Secretary-General and his Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict for bringing renewed focus to the fight for the protection of women. We welcome the Secretary-General's recent report on sexual violence (S/2013/149), as well as the efforts undertaken by the Special Representative, notably during her visits to the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia, to engage leaders and other stakeholders on that most important subject.  We hope that the Secretary-General's report will enhance the coordination and effectiveness of the global response to the problem of sexual violence. Besides addressing specific challenges facing women and girls in conflict zones, such an approach must incorporate broader peace and security imperatives. Critically, we envisage that it will lead to more effective monitoring of the commitments made by Member States to prevent sexual violence, where possible, and to address its consequences, where necessary.  In conflict settings and, more specifically, those driven by genocide ideology, as my country experienced in 1994, rape and sexual assault are used to punish, humiliate and dehumanize victims, their families and communities. Far from being random acts of brutality, the systematic sexual victimization of women and girls in conflict settings is now well understood as a crime against humanity that demands the urgent attention of the world.  Let me touch on the experience of my country with the intent to offer hope to women victimized by conflict. My country's strong stand on violence against women emanates from the high value it places on women and girls, as well as our national resolution to never again see the cruelty directed to Rwandan women during the 1994 genocide. On a national level and beyond our borders, we take this issue extremely seriously.  Just 19 years ago, Rwandan women were forced to endure inhuman and degrading atrocities. Many were raped and left for dead. Among those who survived, many were infected with incurable diseases; some were made pregnant; many suffered the humiliation of having been abused in front of their families. And yet, the women of Rwanda refused to be defined or defeated by their ordeals. They raised their heads, declining to become permanent victims or objects of pity. They sought justice. They demanded dignity. Inasmuch as Rwanda has been able to reconcile and recover from the events of 1994, it is because of that unshakeable spirit of defiance, found foremost among its women and girls.  The use of sexual violence in that fashion was exported from Rwanda to the Democratic Republic of the Congo when genocidal forces escaped into the eastern part of that country, after July 1994. Tragically, that behaviour has been adopted by a plethora of armed groups that operate in the region. As a result, the incidence of such crimes has grown rapidly in recent years. But we must not accept such atrocities as a fact of life. The international community must redouble its efforts to combat the Forces democratiques de liberation du Rwanda, along with those who fund and support them, wherever they are.  It is a broken society that fails to protect its most vulnerable citizens from sexual violence. The proliferation of such violence is a sure sign of State failure. As such, any society hoping to move beyond crisis and conflict cannot hope to do so until it has corrected its course with respect to the treatment and prevention of sexual violence. Indeed, Rwanda's experience leads us to believe that healing and reconciliation are possible only when women claim their rightful place at the heart of our communities. The Government of Rwanda therefore welcomes this opportunity to express our unequivocal condemnation of all forms of violence against women and girls, particularly in conflict situations.  Impunity breeds and rewards criminality and violence. Only by insisting on justice and by fighting impunity has Rwanda been able to achieve meaningful reconciliation within our borders. The eradication of sexual violence in conflict will not be possible as long as perpetrators are able to escape accountability for their actions. We have come to understand first- hand the importance of strengthening internal justice mechanisms and of building institutions that enhance the accessibility of justice. Rwanda therefore calls upon all Member States to enforce accountability, as well as to desist from harbouring the perpetrators of humanitarian and human rights violations, which shields them from the consequences of their crimes.  Rwanda has adopted a range of policies to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls, and I will touch on only some of those in a moment. First, however, it is important to stress that, as we recoiled from the horrors visited upon our women, the Government and people of Rwanda have worked assiduously to instil a culture of respect within the military and the police force, among boys and girls in the classroom and within families and communities. That has prompted a profound shift in attitude among Rwandans of all ages and walks of life.  Specific policy responses to the problem of sexual violence include the establishment of one-stop centres, which offer a wide range of services for the victims of gender-based violence. Those centres bring together the relevant Government agencies, as well as community leaders and civil society, to provide integrated support for victims. That approach of offering comprehensive medical, psychosocial, evidence-gathering and judicial services in one place has been met with such success in the past three years since it began that my Government has committed to a significant expansion of the programme over the next seven years.  In response to the Secretary-General's UNiTE to End Violence against Women and Girls campaign, initiated in 2010, Rwanda hosted an international conference on the role of security organs in ending violence against women and girls. The conference endorsed a declaration and subsequently formed a secretariat to monitor its implementation. With a current membership of 16 countries and a permanent secretariat, based in Kigali, members have developed a standardized training manual to implement an all- Africa command post exercise, code-named Africa UNiTE.  In addition, Rwanda is the leading contributor from Africa of female police and correctional officers to United Nations peace support and peacekeeping missions. Among other duties, those officers actively contribute to combating and raising awareness about violence against women. They also serve as advisers on gender-based violence and share best practices with officers and local authorities. All our peacekeepers undergo specific training on respect for gender and human rights prior to deployment.  Time does not permit me to outline all the initiatives undertaken by my Government, but I note that Rwanda adopted a national action plan on resolution 1325 (2000) in 2010 and is a party to the Kampala Declaration ofthe First Ladies on Sexual and Gender-Based Violence of the 2011 International Conference on the Great Lakes Region.  As expressed during the discussion on the prevention of conflict in Africa earlier this week (see S/PV.6946), Rwanda takes the firm View that lasting peace and security, and therefore the safety of women and girls, are possible only when nations, supported by regional and international bodies, address the root causes of conflict. The degradation of women and girls as part of conflict is unacceptable in any form under any circumstances. Its eradication must be a first-order priority of the Council.  Rwanda urges all parties to armed conflict to enforce a clear prohibition on sexual violence, expressed through chains of command, via codes of conduct and military field manuals and in constant training. We further call upon those parties to ensure that alleged abuses are investigated swiftly and perpetrators held accountable.  Rwanda reminds civilian and military leaders with command responsibilities that they, too, are accountable for acts of sexual violence committed on their watch. Rwanda will, on a case-by-case basis, support the adoption or extension of targeted sanctions against persistent perpetrators of rape and other forms of sexual violence.  Rwanda supports calls to include provisions in all peacekeeping mandates that specifically address the prevention of and response to sexual violence. That should include, where appropriate, the identification of women's protection advisers, as the Secretary-General urged earlier in his statement, alongside gender advisers and human rights protection units.  Rwanda recommends that the problem of sexual violence be addressed directly as part of any post- conflict or peacebuilding process. That should include United Nations-sponsored peace negotiations and security sector reform processes or be part of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration. Whether through legislative reforms, awareness-raising campaigns and the training of police, prosecutors, judges and magistrates or the recruitment of more women to such positions, we must insist that national authorities take proactive steps to protect women and girls. Due consideration should also be given to the prosecution of sexual violence through transitional justice arrangements. In Rwanda, the destigmatization of sexual violence, which empowered victims and gave them a voice, was a central element ofthe post-genocide justice.  I cannot end without calling upon the international community, non-governmental organizations, civil society, faith-based organizations and other non-State actors operating in affected areas to support the genuine reporting and investigation of sexual crimes. That is important to ensure that justice is served and that survivors are able to begin the process of healing. Above all, we call upon all parties to conflict that are responsible for acts of sexual violence to cease such violations.  It is time, in our view, for the world to move beyond expressions of outrage and, instead, to make concrete and measurable progress towards a world where the bodies of women are no longer considered a battlefield. I now resume my functions as President of the Council.  I wish to remind all speakers to limit their statements to no more than four minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber. I wish to inform all concerned that we will continue the debate through the lunch hour, as we have a very large number of speakers.  I now give the floor to the representataive of Norway.  ",The President,,English,u," I shall now make a statement in my national capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Rwanda.

It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution before it. I shall put the draft resolution to the vote now.  A vote was taken by show ofhands.  In favour: Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, China, France, Guatemala, Luxembourg, Morocco, Pakistan, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Rwanda, Togo, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and United States of America  The President: There were 15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as resolution 2106 (2013).  I shall now make a statement in my national capacity as Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom.  I should like to thank the Secretary-General and some of my fellow Ministers for attending this debate; the fact that more than 50 countries wish to take part in this open debate once the Security Council members have spoken shows the growing global interest and determination to act on this issue.  I pay tribute to Zainab Bangura for the energy, determination and vision that she has brought to her role; to Angelina Jolie for her inspirational work on behalf of the world's refugees and for campaigning with me to end rape and sexual violence in conflict; and to Jane Adong Anywar for her courageous work and powerful testimony.  In conflicts in nearly every corner of the globe, rape is used systematically and ruthlessly in the almost certain knowledge that there will be no consequences for the perpetrators. If the international community does not address this culture of impunity, millions more women, children and men could well be subjected to the same appalling treatment, now and in the conflicts of the future. The lead we set and the action we take therefore has the potential to save lives and change the course of events around the world; nothing less than that should be our ambition.  As the international community, we curbed the development of nuclear weapons, heading off a once threatened and unstoppable wave of insecurity. We have binding Conventions against the use of torture and on the treatment of prisoners. We have outlawed the use of chemical weapons and imposed a global ban on cluster munitions. We have made progress in choking off the trade in conflict diamonds, which undermines many fragile countries. Here in the Security Council we adopted historic resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security, and this year we agreed a historic Arms Trade Treaty, to stem the illegal arms trade that exacerbates conflict and causes such human misery.  No country could tackle those vast problems alone, and we have shown that we can confront them together.  Today we face another burning need to unite to improve the condition of humanity; together it is time to say that rape and sexual violence used as a weapon of war is unacceptable, that we know it can be prevented and that we will act now to eradicate it, shouldering our responsibilities as national Governments, and collectively as the Security Council.  Sexual Violence is used to destroy lives, tear apart communities and achieve military objectives, in just the same way that tanks and bullets are.  Like others here I have witnessed the terrible life sentence of trauma and illness inflicted on victims, and the devastating impact on their families and communities.  I am appalled that the vast majority of survivors never receive justice, support or recognition despite years and even decades of waiting, and that it is the victims, not the perpetrators, who still bear the shame and stigma.  I have also seen the devastating impact that sexual violence has on prospects for peace and reconciliation, undermining our efforts as the Security Council to advance peace negotiations and agreements.  We have seen the world over that unresolved grievances fuel further cycles of violence and conflict. Where there is no justice or dignity, the seeds of future violence are sown. A new consciousness of this issue and strong action to protect women and children must run throughout all the Security Council's peacebuilding efforts.  I pay tribute to the organizations and individuals who have worked for years so that the world knows and understands the scale of rape and sexual violence in conflict, and have helped persuade Governments to take it seriously, as many of us are now doing. I applaud the local organizations that are on the front line of efforts to support survivors and achieve accountability, and which need our active support and assistance. Their efforts, allied with new attention from Governments and efforts by the United Nations, means that we are at last poised to be able to make unprecedented and historic progress on confronting wartime rape and sexual violence.  We have made important progress. In London in April, the States members of the Group of Eight (G-8) pledged to address sexual violence in conflict as a threat to global peace and security. I am grateful for the commitments they joined the United Kingdom in making and for the work that is flowing from that agreement.  For example, the United Kingdom is now taking the lead in developing a new international protocol on the investigation and documentation of rape and sexual violence in conflict, working with experts from all over the world. Its aim is to increase the number of successful prosecutions by setting out practical standards for the investigation and documentation of such crimes, so that the strongest possible evidence is collected and survivors are cared for sensitively.  We have also set up a team of over 70 United Kingdom experts, including doctors, forensic scientists, police and gender experts, which can be deployed to reinforce United Nations and national efforts. It has already been deployed in Bosnia, to the Syrian border, and to Libya, Mali and the Democratic Republic of the Congo this year. Later this year we will carry out further deployments to support Syrian survivors, and we will return to Bosnia, Mali and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  We are determined to continue and build on those efforts as the United Kingdom and to build new partnerships with countries also working in this area. But we need global action if we are to shatter the culture of impunity.  That is why we have put this issue at the heart of our presidency this month, and why I also intend to convene a global gathering on this issue during the session of the General Assembly in September.  Resolution 2106 (2013), which we have just adopted today, sends a powerful signal to the world of leadership from the Security Council. It recognizes the commitments made in the G-8 declaration, which will add to the international momentum that has begun to gather but which must now become unstoppable. It recognizes the responsibility of national Governments to uphold human rights and the rule of law in their countries, and it will expand the tools available to Ms. Bangura to work with them, notably the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia, which have shown great courage in signing joint communique's with the United Nations.  The resolution also recognize s that effective investigation and documentation of sexual violence in armed conflict is Vital to bringing perpetrators to justice and ensuring recourse to justice for survivors, and I hope that the new international protocol will be able to make a difference in that area.  I hope that there will also be new commitments by countries around the world support the deployment of professionals with expertise in the way I have described.  These and other steps listed in the resolution, if fully implemented, will represent vital new advances. But it is only a beginning. We need action on all fronts, from the Security Council and the United Nations as a whole, and from Governments in conflict-affected countries. We need to begin to demolish impunity, create a new culture of deterrence, and at the same time focus on long-term care and support for survivors.  We need to home in on lack of accountability as one of the root causes of rape and sexual violence in conflict, but at the same time not forget that women's political, social and economic empowerment across all societies is essential and that our goal must be the full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  We need the Security Council to keep showing the determined leadership that we have called for, and at the same time must listen to, involve and support local organizations. Indeed, I strongly support the development of a network of regional champions to support their efforts.  Of course, all countries must do more to address violence against women in all its forms, and not just in conflict situations.  We can and must do all those things but must never lose sight of our overriding objective: to consign the use of rape as a weapon of war to the pages of history. I believe that has to begin, above all, with a focus on ending impunity and by bringing to bear the weight, authority and leadership of the Security Council.  Building on today's debate, I have new hope that this will at last be possible.  I now resume my functions as President of the Council.

UNSC_2013_SPV.7044_spch024.txt,2013,7044,"The President: I shall now make a statement in my national capacity.  At the outset, I would like to thank Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon for his statement and for presenting his report on women and peace and security (S/2013/525). We are also grateful to the Under- Secretary-General and Executive Director UN Women, Ms. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka; the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms. Navi Pillay; and the board member of the NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security, Ms. Brigitte Balipou, for their briefings.  We have proposed to focus our debate on women, the rule of law and transitional justice in conflict-affected situations. In recent times, the Security Council has paid increasing attention to the issue, acknowledging that combating impunity, addressing past violations, rebuilding the justice sector and asserting the principles of the rule of law underpin efforts to build peace and stability in the aftermath of conflict. However, less attention has been paid to the gender consequences of the breakdown of the rule of law during and after conflict. While genuine gains have been made in strengthening the political will and international legal framework to secure justice and deal with conflict- related sexual violence, little has been said of the full range of violations and serious crimes experienced by women, including enforced disappearances, foreign occupation, mass forced displacement, restrictions on humanitarian aid, conflict-related human trafficking and the destruction of civilian infrastructure. There can be no tolerance for such acts. Combating impunity and strengthening both international and national justice responses are critically important in that regard.  Governments bear the primary responsibility for the protection of civilians and for ensuring accountability for conflict-related criminal offenses. In resolution 2122 (2013), adopted today, the Security Council once again calls on Member States to comply with their relevant obligations to end impunity and to thoroughly investigate and prosecute persons responsible for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and other serious violations of international humanitarian law. At the same time, when national authorities fail to take action, the international community should play a more proactive role in ensuring an appropriate response. Such measures and appropriate protection and accountability efforts must obviously be free of selectively and politically motivated approaches and preferences. It is essential to address conflict-related violations and abuses of human rights through all available means, including, inter alia, by mandating international commissions of inquiry and fact-finding missions, as well as by supporting the implementation of the recommendations of those bodies and missions.  As we have stated on a number ofoccasions, wrongs that have been left unpunished or unrecognized may impede progress in achieving long-awaited peace and reconciliation. Such wrongs can also play a key role in the eruption ofnew conflicts and the commission ofnew crimes. Our consistent focus on that particular aspect of the problem is based on my country's experience in addressing the tragic humanitarian consequences of the war unleashed against it, including mass atrocities committed by adverse armed forces, forced population displacement in Azerbaijan and the continuing military occupation of its territories.  It is important that the Security Council, Member States and regional organizations ensure that mediators and envoys in mediation, peace and preventive diplomacy process can contribute to ensuring accountability, including by encouraging the parties concerned to envisage transitional justice clauses in peace agreements. Those responsible for serious crimes committed during conflicts, including gender- based Violence, must be excluded from all branches of Government, and the principle of no amnesty or any other form of indulgence for the perpetrators of such offenses must be applied. Such measures should be implemented comprehensively and should also envisage the full rights of victims to redress.  In resolution 2122 (2013), the Council recalls applicable provisions of international law on the right to reparations for violations of individual rights. It is essential that reparations programmes receive increased recognition and support as a tool for delivering justice and redress for victims and longer-term peace dividends within societies and communities. The contribution of transitional justice measures to rebuilding the rule of law, redress, justice and reconciliation makes such measures equally important tools for furthering women's rights in post-conflict societies.

UNSC_2014_SPV.7160_spch022.txt,2014,7160,"The President: I shall now make a statement in my national capacity.  I would first like to join others in thanking the Secretary- General for his insightful report (S/2014/l81), which has provided this important debate with ample guidance. I would also like to express our appreciation to Special Representative of the Secretary-General Zainab Hawa Bangura for her determined and enduring efforts to ensure global involvement in the fight against the abhorrent crimes of rape and sexual violence, especially in conflict.  Those present will all agree with me that Ms. Rhoda Misaka stirred our conscience this morning with her impassioned statement. She reveals the horror of sexual violence in conflict and invites us to fight this barbarism - more than barbarism - with unrelenting determination and commitment. We want to thank her and say that we support her in her work.  Nigeria takes note of the highlights of the Secretary- General's report, including the actions taken by States and the challenges confronting them in conflict and post-conflict situations in preventing sexual violence. We welcome the broad-based consultations that guided the report's preparation, which involved United Nations entities in the United Nations Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict, field missions and country teams, all concerned Member States and non-governmental organizations. We acknowledge the important work of the United Nations Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict. We encourage Member States to draw on their expertise in strengthening the rule of law and the capacities of civilian and military justice systems.  That is all part of a broader effort to strengthen institutional safeguards against impunity for conflict- related sexual Violence. Donors should be encouraged to ensure sustainable funding for this valuable resource for the countries concerned. Nigeria shares the Secretary- General's view that the lack of capacity remains one of the major impediments to ensuring accountability, which leads to widespread impunity. In turn, that has a detrimental impact on access to justice and the security and safety of survivors. It is evident that survivors' access to justice can be hindered by restrictions on physical access and inadequate legislation, or, indeed, by the financial and social costs associated with reporting and pursuing justice for crimes of sexual violence. Regrettably, many countries lack legal aid services and protocols for the protection of victims and witnesses, and an already weakened criminal justice system amplifies the lack of access to justice. We are pleased to note that United Nations actors, including the Team of Experts, continue to support national authorities in that regard.  It is a matter of concern, as highlighted in the report, that the prevalence of sexual violence during a conflict often leaves not only an impact but especially bitter memories, with acute consequences for the security of women and children even when peace has been restored. That may ultimately have a direct bearing on the durability of peace and prospects for sustainable development.  With that in mind, the time has come for us to redouble our efforts in the fight against the scourge and to hold all perpetrators accountable. That is the consensus in the Chamber.  The Security Council demonstrated leadership in that regard in June 2013, by adopting resolution 2106 (2013), which underscores the need for more systematic monitoring of sexual violence in armed conflict. It is therefore imperative that the Council develop appropriate response mechanisms and consistently improve existing ones to ensure the participation of women in all aspects of mediation, post-conflict recovery and peacebuilding.  We acknowledge the critical role of women protection advisers within human rights and women's empowerment and gender units in peacekeeping operations.  At the global level there is now unprecedented commitment and momentum on the application of all the relevant Security Council resolutions. The international community must sustain that momentum. As part of those accomplishments, we believe that a great deal more needs to be done to implement commitments on women and peace and security. For example, there is a need for increased sex-disaggregated data on security threats in order to contribute to greater security for women.  My country welcomes the Secretary-General's recommendations that outline critical elements for the prevention of sexual violence in conflict, specific actions required at political and operational levels and the need for national ownership, leadership and responsibility. The determination to tackle sexual violence in conflict is not confined to the United Nations. At the regional level, under the auspices of the African Union, the African Solidarity Initiative held a high-level meeting in October 2013 on preventing and responding to sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict countries and beyond. That consultation was organized under key international policy and action frameworks, particularly resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008), the 2005 World Summit Outcome (General Assembly resolution 60/1), the Protocol on the Rights of Women in Africa, the protocol on the prevention and suppression of sexual violence against women and children and the 2009 African Union gender policy. The meeting was aimed at significantly reducing and eliminating sexual violence and accelerating the implementation of agreed responses, especially those related to prevention and protection and victims' access to care and justice.  At the subregional level in West Africa, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has also put in place strong mechanisms with regard to the role of women in conflict prevention and management. Those include the protocol on conflict prevention, management, resolution, peacekeeping and security and the supplementary protocol on democracy and good governance. Those mechanisms form the basis of the ECOWAS conflict-prevention framework.  The women and peace and security component of the framework is aimed at consolidating women's role, participation and impact at all stages of conflict management, including humanitarian provisions, while reinforcing various national and regional mechanisms on their protection and promotion.  Other regional initiatives of that nature include the women's network for peace and security in the ECOWAS region; the West Africa Network for Peacebuilding; the Movement against Small Arms and Light Weapons in West Africa; and the Alliance of African Initiatives for peace and stability in West Africa.  At national level, through the Law Reform Commission and the Federal Ministry of Justice, Nigeria has initiated reforms in the criminal justice system to ensure the delivery of gender justice in law and practice. Bills on addressing gender equality and all forms of violence against women and girls have been sponsored at both the federal and state level. Strident steps have been taken at the national level to ensure the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). In the same vein, Nigeria stresses the importance of compliance with resolution 1820 (2008), on ending acts of sexual violence against women in conflict.  Nigeria fully embraces the adoption of political commitments to prevent sexual violence in conflict, namely, the historic declarations adopted by the Group of Eight countries in April 2013 and the Declaration of Commitment to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, which has been signed by more than 140 nations. We believe that Member States should implement those commitments as a matter of high priority. Member States that have yet to sign that important Declaration should be encouraged to do so before the October deadline - about six months from now.  It is critical for States to focus collectively on converting the political commitments into concrete preventive action, particularly at national level. It is in that spirit that Nigeria today, in this forum, declares its intention to sign on to that laudable initiative as a means of demonstrating its unwavering commitment to the fight against sexual violence and all its ramifications.  I now resume my functions as President of the Council.  Iwish to request all speakers to limit their statements to no more than four minutes to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.

UNSC_2014_SPV.7289_spch024.txt,2014,7289,"The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now make a statement in my capacity as representative of Argentina.  I come from a country where women represent 15 per cent of the military and have achieved the rank of military officers among the hierarchy. We have become a country that now promotes the presence of women in all branches of the army, where they had been banned until 2012. We have established gender offices in each area of the military and have strengthened gender focal points with a View to preparing for deployment the men and women who will participate in peacekeeping operations. Furthermore, child care centres for parents who work in the armed forces and the security forces have been opened.  We have also re-assigned personnel of military hospitals who have declared that they have conscientious objections to the interruption of pregnancy, which is permitted under Argentine legislation, so that women are able to exercise their right to sexual and reproductive health services without any obstacle or delay. We advocate for laws on same-sex marriage and gender identity and against any form of discrimination. This year in London, we signed, along with 137 countries, a commitment to bring an end to sexual violence in armed conflict.  We work in our region and we work with our region. I come from a country where women in particular peacefully confronted State terrorism - I am speaking of the Mothers and Grandmothers of May Square - in deciding to fight for justice rather than for vengeance. They chose to free the truth rather than remain prisoners of lies. They chose to pass through the culture of memory rather than the indifference of oblivion.  I come from that country and that is why we can understand, as members of the Security Council, that in all situations of armed conflict, the number of civilian victims far exceeds the number of combatants. Today, that number is the highest ever seen in history. We know that women and men suffer all types of human rights violations during conflicts. However, only recently have we been able to reveal and to make people understand that there are specific forms, different types of violence that women suffer during conflicts and that there are different impacts at the various stages - prior to conflict, during conflict and post-conflict - on women and girls.  We know that, whether we are talking about civilians or combatants or refugees or displaced persons, the impact of conflict on women and girls is multidimensional and complex. The varying types and modalities of violence affect women disproportionately and differently, simply as a result of their being women, with devastating effects on their psychological and physical integrity and fundamental rights.  Various reports in recent years from United Nations agencies, including UN-Women and human rights organizations and women and feminist organizations have provided accounts and empirical evidence of the fact that conflicts crystallize, deepen and generate evidence of the disproportionate practices of violence, based on the pre-existing stereotypes of inequality, discrimination and Violence against women in society.  Also in peacetime, we still encounter cultural patterns based on patriarchal power structures that seem to tolerate or justify violence, rape and other forms of sexual abuse against women. It is undisputed that in a scenario where political tension increases and militarization appears to be the chosen path for resolving a growing conflict, all forms of violence seem to increase, including rape and other forms of sexual Violence against women.  We know that violence, which precedes conflicts and intensifies during a conflict, often remains, in the post-conflict period, as part of the legacy of the conflict. It is known that in such situations women and girls are most vulnerable to sexual violence, especially rape. Women also face enormous obstacles in obtaining justice, owing to the stigma that characterizes us as survivors of sexual violence and the conditions of structured gender inequality that exist in most of our societies and often force us to experience and coexist with the impunity of perpetrators.  On a daily basis, the Council receives reports describing human rights violations against women and crimes against the sexual integrity of women and girls in conflict situations, including the abduction of women and girls for the purposes of labour exploitation, sexual slavery and human trafficking. The Council has been warned that, in many cases, the perpetrators are members of rebel groups or groups committing terrorist acts; however, they also belong to militias that are supported by Governments, including members of governmental armed forces or security forces, or even members of peacekeeping operations. We know that, and we know that women reach refugee camps but are still not safe there. In March, according to a United Nations report, up to 16 women living in refugee camps were being raped every day when they went out to look for water, fulfilling their duties and tasks, because there was a fear that if men left the camp they would be killed.  Today we know that acts of violence against women, refugees and the displaced in the camps, including sexual violence, are not an exception but, in many cases, the rule. Furthermore, sexual violence and the rape of women and girls used as a weapon of war remains so widespread and present in all situations of conflict that it is sometimes considered to be an inherent component of conflict, running the risk of making natural what clearly constitutes, in international human rights and international humanitarian law, a war crime and a crime against humanity.  Moreover, while sexual violence may be the most extensive type of violence practiced against women in conflict, we have also learned that women also suffer specific damage and are disproportionately affected in many other ways in conflict situations. Economic aspects of vulnerability, social exclusion and cultural marginalization are the effects of militarization and conflict. The adverse impacts on the rights of women to food, water, housing, employment, health care and education are just as great a threat to the lives of women as the physical form of Violence.  In 2013, it was said that there were 50.2 million forcibly displaced persons in the world. We know that women constitute more than half of the refugee population. However severe the vulnerabilities of displaced people may be, women live in situations of even greater vulnerability still, as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees says, including once they have managed to reach a place that is apparently safe. Some women are pursued because they do not follow certain customs or because they were the object of an early or forced marriage. The risk of sexual violence increases also in places where they go to be protected.  When women become refugees, they must break with their livelihoods and the cycles of life and become completely dependent on humanitarian agencies for basic survival. The anguish is immense for women who leave their homes to begin an uncertain journey, which more often than not does not include a return trip. Women and girls who have fled their homes and communities often experience prolonged suffering, and the place of refuge becomes a place of violence. Sometimes they are forced to offer sex in exchange for food or to obtain the status ofrefugees or to have access to documentation.  Women belonging to national, ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities suffer even more. Age, sex, sexual orientation and other specific factors can also expose them to risks of additional discrimination and lack of protection. Women who are disabled face a greater risk of lack of protection during a displacement in the camps. Women and girls who seek refuge in the cities run the risk of experiencing discrimination and abuse. Many live in poverty or extreme poverty, which makes them even more vulnerable and exposed to the risk of becoming merchandise in the sex trade.  Women and girls who go to camps for displaced persons and refugees may discover that even there the material assistance is minimal. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said this year that only 12 per cent of the projects that are being financed today in order to comply with international humanitarian law in the camps - only 12 per cent - include the gender perspective and a human rights approach.  The physical distribution of the camps also represents a problem and a risk for women. In some cases, the very officials who are supposed to look after and care for the refugees are the ones who violate the rights of women. There has been a considerable rise in the number of undesired pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases and abortions. Pregnant women sometimes have to face a risk to their health due to the lack of medical assistance, which, along with the physical and psychological pressure of the conflict, leads to a disproportionate number of non-provoked abortions, miscarriages, babies with low birth weights, representing between 20 and 50 per cent of newborns. The rate of teenage pregnancy in the camps is roughly 50 per cent. In some cases, the supplies do not include the specific needs of women.  I note that it was only recently, and thanks to the impetus and demands of the women's movement, that we have included hygienic items in the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' list of essential supplies even when most of the refugees are women. When there is no access to hygienic products, women and girls have to remain separate, without access to education, without being able to look for food, and without receiving the regular supplies they need when they menstruate.  Lastly, I believe it necessary and important to have this debate today because the current members of the Security Council have experience with the reality of refugee camps. I believe that, as my colleagues have said, in the light of the upcoming review of resolution 1325 (2000); in the light of the post-2015 sustainable development goals; in the light of the forthcoming review the sanctions system and United Nations peacekeeping operations; and in the light of our twentieth-anniversary review the of the Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action, it is time for women, as we have said so often - because we are half the population, because we are human, because we have the right to enjoy our rights, and because we have a voice, convictions and courage - we will head into 2015 staking our claims, expressing ourselves, making our demands and defending our rights. We will exert the liberty to think, to say, to act and to be what even women in refugee camps need. We do not want to be either oppressors or oppressed. We want to be free and equal, so that we can be the authors of real peace.  I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.  I wish to request all speakers to limit their statements to no more than four minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.

However severe the vulnerabilities of displaced people may be, women live in situations of even greater vulnerability still, as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees says, including once they have managed to reach a place that is apparently safe. Some women are pursued because they do not follow certain customs or because they were the object of an early or forced marriage. The risk of sexual violence increases also in places where they go to be protected.  When women become refugees, they must break with their livelihoods and the cycles of life and become completely dependent on humanitarian agencies for basic survival. The anguish is immense for women who leave their homes to begin an uncertain journey, which more often than not does not include a return trip. Women and girls who have fled their homes and communities often experience prolonged suffering, and the place of refuge becomes a place of violence. Sometimes they are forced to offer sex in exchange for food or to obtain the status ofrefugees or to have access to documentation.  Women belonging to national, ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities suffer even more. Age, sex, sexual orientation and other specific factors can also expose them to risks of additional discrimination and lack of protection. Women who are disabled face a greater risk of lack of protection during a displacement in the camps. Women and girls who seek refuge in the cities run the risk of experiencing discrimination and abuse. Many live in poverty or extreme poverty, which makes them even more vulnerable and exposed to the risk of becoming merchandise in the sex trade.  Women and girls who go to camps for displaced persons and refugees may discover that even there the material assistance is minimal. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said this year that only 12 per cent of the projects that are being financed today in order to comply with international humanitarian law in the camps - only 12 per cent - include the gender perspective and a human rights approach.  The physical distribution of the camps also represents a problem and a risk for women. In some cases, the very officials who are supposed to look after and care for the refugees are the ones who violate the rights of women. There has been a considerable rise in the number of undesired pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases and abortions. Pregnant women sometimes have to face a risk to their health due to the lack of medical assistance, which, along with the physical and psychological pressure of the conflict, leads to a disproportionate number of non-provoked abortions, miscarriages, babies with low birth weights, representing between 20 and 50 per cent of newborns. The rate of teenage pregnancy in the camps is roughly 50 per cent. In some cases, the supplies do not include the specific needs of women.  I note that it was only recently, and thanks to the impetus and demands of the women's movement, that we have included hygienic items in the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' list of essential supplies even when most of the refugees are women. When there is no access to hygienic products, women and girls have to remain separate, without access to education, without being able to look for food, and without receiving the regular supplies they need when they menstruate.  Lastly, I believe it necessary and important to have this debate today because the current members of the Security Council have experience with the reality of refugee camps. I believe that, as my colleagues have said, in the light of the upcoming review of resolution 1325 (2000); in the light of the post-2015 sustainable development goals; in the light of the forthcoming review the sanctions system and United Nations peacekeeping operations; and in the light of our twentieth-anniversary review the of the Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action, it is time for women, as we have said so often - because we are half the population, because we are human, because we have the right to enjoy our rights, and because we have a voice, convictions and courage - we will head into 2015 staking our claims, expressing ourselves, making our demands and defending our rights. We will exert the liberty to think, to say, to act and to be what even women in refugee camps need. We do not want to be either oppressors or oppressed. We want to be free and equal, so that we can be the authors of real peace.  I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.  I wish to request all speakers to limit their statements to no more than four minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.

UNSC_2015_SPV.7374_spch022.txt,2015,7374,"The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Chile.  My delegation aligns itself with the statement to be delivered by the representative of Austria on behalf of the Human Security Network.  Chile proposed this open debate on the challenges of protecting women and girls in armed conflict and post-conflict situations because the protection of civilians in armed conflict is one of the most pressing issues before the Security Council. Promoting respect for humanitarian principles is among our shared actions and responsibilities to protect civilians - obligations that the United Nations assumes when a State is unable or unwilling to apply these principles.  The challenges of protecting women and girls in armed conflicts and their aftermath call for us to help  promote and ensure the equality of women before the law and justice. In that context, all discriminatory provisions against women that increase their vulnerability in conflict situations, such as those relating to citizenship and access to land, must be repealed.  It is crucial to address threats to women's safety by promoting and protecting their rights and by empowering them to fully enjoy those rights, taking account of the particular needs. Likewise, we must eradicate practices that are unacceptable regardless of sociocultural or religious context, such as the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.  During 2014, the Council addressed humanitarian situations affecting millions of women and girls, many of them displaced or refugees. Serious violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law, such as those committed by Boko Haram, in particular against women and girls, including abductions, are abhorrent acts and must cease. We reiterate the call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, including the school-age girls abducted in April 2014.  We welcome the contributions of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to make available to those providing assistance concrete programmes and measures to ensure the protection of women and girls such as promoting the equal protection of women before the law and their access to justice; integrating women in all peace processes and peace agreements; and ensuring their participation in the planning and implementation of recovery and reconstruction programmes in post- conflict rehabilitation.  The United Nations and the Security Council must take a rights-based approach in addressing the multidimensional character of gender issues, thus rejecting relativism and disregard for universal rights. This should be part of a broader set of measures to prevent violence against women in armed conflict or post-conflict situations, guaranteeing reparations for and the reintegration of victims, as well as fighting against impunity. These concerns must not be left out as we build a comprehensive post-2015 development agenda.  Resolution 1325 (2000), together with its related resolutions, constitutes a turning point for addressing the major impact of armed conflict on women and girls, who are victims of violence and surrounded by barriers, discrimination and inequality. The document also provides solutions in terms of participation, protection, prevention and post-conflict recovery - the so-called ""four Ps"" - which must be supported with sustainable budgets for their implementation.  Gender must be mainstreamed throughout international peace and security decision-making bodies, mechanisms and processes, and integrated into the formulation and implementation of the mission mandates and the work of the Council. That should include briefings from the relevant organizations and Special Envoys as a preventive and early-warning mechanism.  The Council's upcoming 2015 high-level review to measure progress on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and the global study on its implementation provide an opportunity to take advantage of the experience we have gained and to improve the capabilities of States and of the United Nations system in this area. We are convinced of the need for synergy between this review and those related to the peacebuilding architecture, peacekeeping operations and the special political missions of the Secretary- General.  It would also be useful to conduct a working meeting to analyse and recommend practical measures that would complement the incorporation of the protection of women and girls and a gender perspective into the architecture to protect civilians within the United Nations. As part of the agenda for the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016, a fourth topic, focused on addressing the needs of persons in conflict, could be an interesting vehicle to consider these issues.  We trust that this debate will strengthen political support to achieve the effective protection of civilians in the terms enshrined in international law, international human rights law and international humanitarian law. I now resume my functions as President of the Council.

It is crucial to address threats to women's safety by promoting and protecting their rights and by empowering them to fully enjoy those rights, taking account of the particular needs. Likewise, we must eradicate practices that are unacceptable regardless of sociocultural or religious context, such as the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.  During 2014, the Council addressed humanitarian situations affecting millions of women and girls, many of them displaced or refugees. Serious violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law, such as those committed by Boko Haram, in particular against women and girls, including abductions, are abhorrent acts and must cease. We reiterate the call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, including the school-age girls abducted in April 2014.  We welcome the contributions of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to make available to those providing assistance concrete programmes and measures to ensure the protection of women and girls such as promoting the equal protection of women before the law and their access to justice; integrating women in all peace processes and peace agreements; and ensuring their participation in the planning and implementation of recovery and reconstruction programmes in post- conflict rehabilitation.  The United Nations and the Security Council must take a rights-based approach in addressing the multidimensional character of gender issues, thus rejecting relativism and disregard for universal rights. This should be part of a broader set of measures to prevent violence against women in armed conflict or post-conflict situations, guaranteeing reparations for and the reintegration of victims, as well as fighting against impunity. These concerns must not be left out as we build a comprehensive post-2015 development agenda.  Resolution 1325 (2000), together with its related resolutions, constitutes a turning point for addressing the major impact of armed conflict on women and girls, who are victims of violence and surrounded by barriers, discrimination and inequality. The document also provides solutions in terms of participation, protection, prevention and post-conflict recovery - the so-called ""four Ps"" - which must be supported with sustainable budgets for their implementation.  Gender must be mainstreamed throughout international peace and security decision-making bodies, mechanisms and processes, and integrated into the formulation and implementation of the mission mandates and the work of the Council. That should include briefings from the relevant organizations and Special Envoys as a preventive and early-warning mechanism.  The Council's upcoming 2015 high-level review to measure progress on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and the global study on its implementation provide an opportunity to take advantage of the experience we have gained and to improve the capabilities of States and of the United Nations system in this area. We are convinced of the need for synergy between this review and those related to the peacebuilding architecture, peacekeeping operations and the special political missions of the Secretary- General.  It would also be useful to conduct a working meeting to analyse and recommend practical measures that would complement the incorporation of the protection of women and girls and a gender perspective into the architecture to protect civilians within the United Nations. As part of the agenda for the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016, a fourth topic, focused on addressing the needs of persons in conflict, could be an interesting vehicle to consider these issues.  We trust that this debate will strengthen political support to achieve the effective protection of civilians in the terms enshrined in international law, international human rights law and international humanitarian law. I now resume my functions as President of the Council.  I wish to remind all speakers to limit their statements to no more than four minutes in order to enable the Council to be able to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber. I would also like to appeal to speakers to deliver their statements at a normal speed so that interpretation may be provided properly. I wish to inform all concerned that we will be carrying this open debate right through the lunch hour, as we have a very large number of speakers.  I now give the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden. I would also like to extend our sincere condolences on the passing away of our friend, Mr. Marten Grunditz.  "

UNSC_2015_SPV.7428_spch020.txt,2015,7428,"The President (spoke in Arabic): I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Jordan.  At the outset, I wish to thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Ms. Zainab Hawa Bangura, and her team for their outstanding efforts in drafting the report before us today (S/2015/203), and for her comprehensive briefing. I also thank Mr. Hamsatu Allamin of the NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security for her enlightening briefing.  Tangible progress has been made in terms of developing standards and legal frameworks to protect against sexual Violence in conflict. The approach adopted by the international community to prevent this barbaric phenomenon has been instrumental. In spite of that progress, however, we continue to see the most abject of crimes being perpetrated during and after conflict, including rape, forced prostitution, sexual slavery and forced sterilization.  The report of the Secretary-General (S/2015/203) paints a very gloomy picture with respect to the unprecedented increase in the types of violence and the number of victims, in particular in the Middle East and Africa. In fact, some States and State-affiliated groups, as well as non-State armed groups, have adopted innovative measures to systematically use sexual Violence as a weapon of war against civilians - to terrorize them and force them into exile or displacement, to humiliate them and undermine the moral authority and standing of the adversary, and to get victims to join their ranks. In that regard, the acts perpetrated by Daesh - including mass kidnappings of women and minors in areas under its control, rape, the sale and presentation of women as gifts, and systematic sexual servitude - require that we give this problem the priority attention it deserves.  Daesh is also using such violence and collective punishment as a way of attracting and winning over young delinquents to their ranks. The same goes for Boko Haram, which carries out mass kidnappings of girls in Nigeria, exploiting them in the worst way by using girls under the age of 10 for suicide attacks. In that regard, we note that there is no specific registry of the number of victims of those crimes perpetrated in conflicts. As members are aware, that is because victims do not submit complaints in order to avoid being stigmatized or held responsible. They also fear reprisals against their local communities. Hence the importance of awareness-raising in communities to change those mistaken perceptions, which are prevalent in some conflict areas. We need to empower victims and ensure the necessary protection. We need to create an environment conducive to their return to normal lives.  Among the major challenges currently facing the international community, there is the need to ensure accountability with respect to the perpetrators of these crimes. We need to ensure that there is no impunity. In that regard, we reiterate the need for States to cooperate by observing the obligation to extradite or prosecute perpetrators. Legal mechanisms to combat these crimes exist under international treaties and conventions. However, legal gaps remain that we must work to fill, as they impede the prosecution of perpetrators. In that regard, we also need to help countries and empower their legal institutions in order to address these issues. We also call on the Security Council to work with the International Criminal Court in prosecuting perpetrators by pressuring States that are unable or unwilling to act to prosecute or extradite perpetrators to third parties for prosecution. We reiterate the importance for the Security Council to also encourage documentation and follow-up on these crimes.  We need to encourage States engulfed in violence or armed conflict to develop plans of action to combat sexual violence, as well as to grant the relevant United Nations agencies access to conflict zones in order to provide the necessary support to victims. We pay tribute to the efforts ofthe Organization in launching an initiative to improve the performance of United Nations missions with regard to issues of sexual violence.  Within our modest means, we in Jordan are working actively to ensure the greatest possible protection and care for victims of these types of crimes with respect to Syrian refugees. It goes without saying that we condemn all attempts by individuals to exploit refugees, especially women and girls, by exposing them to the dangers of such crimes owing to the circumstances they are living in. Jordan is raising awareness among individual refugees upon their entry into Jordan, providing them with pamphlets on their human rights and ensuring that they are not exploited. We have also set aside spaces for refugees in public and private schools, based on our belief in education as the front line of defence against this type of crime.  Some of the steps taken by Jordan to reduce the incidence of this phenomenon in armed conflict include the holding of training sessions on investigating sexual violence in conflict, as well as sessions on legal aspects and for police officers and military commanders. We are also keen to promote the role of women in the military in order to heighten the effectiveness of humanitarian missions and peacekeeping operations. We are also increasing the role of women in the Kingdom's medical services by ensuring that they are present in clinics and field hospitals. Jordanian women have had a key role to play in caring for and protecting Syrian refugees. This will contribute to their involvement in peacekeeping operations.  We call for speeding up the appointment ofa special adviser on the protection of women. We also call for a gender-specific approach in United Nations missions.  In conclusion, we have a long road ahead in the efforts pursued by Member States and United Nations bodies in order to ensure the necessary protection against sexual Violence in conflict and ultimately eradicate it. In that regard, I want to recall that victims are possibly among the people we know. As such, we should continue to support any and every effort in order to prevent and eradicate this heinous phenomenon and bring about a better future for coming generations.

The report of the Secretary-General (S/2015/203) paints a very gloomy picture with respect to the unprecedented increase in the types of violence and the number of victims, in particular in the Middle East and Africa. In fact, some States and State-affiliated groups, as well as non-State armed groups, have adopted innovative measures to systematically use sexual Violence as a weapon of war against civilians - to terrorize them and force them into exile or displacement, to humiliate them and undermine the moral authority and standing of the adversary, and to get victims to join their ranks. In that regard, the acts perpetrated by Daesh - including mass kidnappings of women and minors in areas under its control, rape, the sale and presentation of women as gifts, and systematic sexual servitude - require that we give this problem the priority attention it deserves.  Daesh is also using such violence and collective punishment as a way of attracting and winning over young delinquents to their ranks. The same goes for Boko Haram, which carries out mass kidnappings of girls in Nigeria, exploiting them in the worst way by using girls under the age of 10 for suicide attacks. In that regard, we note that there is no specific registry of the number of victims of those crimes perpetrated in conflicts. As members are aware, that is because victims do not submit complaints in order to avoid being stigmatized or held responsible. They also fear reprisals against their local communities. Hence the importance of awareness-raising in communities to change those mistaken perceptions, which are prevalent in some conflict areas. We need to empower victims and ensure the necessary protection. We need to create an environment conducive to their return to normal lives.  Among the major challenges currently facing the international community, there is the need to ensure accountability with respect to the perpetrators of these crimes. We need to ensure that there is no impunity. In that regard, we reiterate the need for States to cooperate by observing the obligation to extradite or prosecute perpetrators. Legal mechanisms to combat these crimes exist under international treaties and conventions. However, legal gaps remain that we must work to fill, as they impede the prosecution of perpetrators. In that regard, we also need to help countries and empower their legal institutions in order to address these issues. We also call on the Security Council to work with the International Criminal Court in prosecuting perpetrators by pressuring States that are unable or unwilling to act to prosecute or extradite perpetrators to third parties for prosecution. We reiterate the importance for the Security Council to also encourage documentation and follow-up on these crimes.  We need to encourage States engulfed in violence or armed conflict to develop plans of action to combat sexual violence, as well as to grant the relevant United Nations agencies access to conflict zones in order to provide the necessary support to victims. We pay tribute to the efforts ofthe Organization in launching an initiative to improve the performance of United Nations missions with regard to issues of sexual violence.  Within our modest means, we in Jordan are working actively to ensure the greatest possible protection and care for victims of these types of crimes with respect to Syrian refugees. It goes without saying that we condemn all attempts by individuals to exploit refugees, especially women and girls, by exposing them to the dangers of such crimes owing to the circumstances they are living in. Jordan is raising awareness among individual refugees upon their entry into Jordan, providing them with pamphlets on their human rights and ensuring that they are not exploited. We have also set aside spaces for refugees in public and private schools, based on our belief in education as the front line of defence against this type of crime.  Some of the steps taken by Jordan to reduce the incidence of this phenomenon in armed conflict include the holding of training sessions on investigating sexual violence in conflict, as well as sessions on legal aspects and for police officers and military commanders. We are also keen to promote the role of women in the military in order to heighten the effectiveness of humanitarian missions and peacekeeping operations. We are also increasing the role of women in the Kingdom's medical services by ensuring that they are present in clinics and field hospitals. Jordanian women have had a key role to play in caring for and protecting Syrian refugees. This will contribute to their involvement in peacekeeping operations.  We call for speeding up the appointment ofa special adviser on the protection of women. We also call for a gender-specific approach in United Nations missions.  In conclusion, we have a long road ahead in the efforts pursued by Member States and United Nations bodies in order to ensure the necessary protection against sexual Violence in conflict and ultimately eradicate it. In that regard, I want to recall that victims are possibly among the people we know. As such, we should continue to support any and every effort in order to prevent and eradicate this heinous phenomenon and bring about a better future for coming generations.

Women are not spared any of the brutal consequences of war, and are additionally subject to uniquely degrading and traumatizing attacks and long- term consequences. It is only just and reasonable that their voices should be present and influential in the work of preventing and resolving violence and war.  It is well documented that sexual violence of many kinds accompanies modern warfare. We all know the awful litany. Women are raped and trafficked, forced into prostitution to earn a living, and terrorized individually and in their roles as protectors of their children and other vulnerable family members. All violence against human life is terrible, but sexual Violence is designed to debase, dehumanize and demoralize in a unique way. The consequences are profound and long-lasting, physical as well as psychological. The hatred and humiliation these crimes can provoke are deep and surely impede in powerful ways the achievement of the goals of peace and security for which this institution was created.  The recent year has been marked by new and ongoing atrocities involving sexual violence in various conflicts and by groups such as Boko Haram and the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham. Some are also attacks upon women and girls purely because of the faith they profess. Although this is of very serious concern today for Christians, surely it is a matter where our shared human nature, across all religions and cultures, cries out for the common commitment of members of all faiths and Governments to strongly condemning and confronting such heinous acts and to stepping forward to protect those threatened.  It seems that, in the past several years, there has emerged a greater international consciousness of the scourge of human trafficking, and even increased response. It is to be hoped that there will be an ever greater appreciation ofwhat Pope Francis has called the trauma, affecting the body and spirit, of rape as a tool of war. To adapt an observation made by His Holiness, a two-point drop in the stock market is front-page news, while the violation of hundreds or even thousands of women may go unreported.  My delegation supports those processes identified in successive reports issued by the Secretary-General as essential for ensuring justice to women assaulted in conflict, effective investigation and documentation, consistent and rigorous prosecution, and ongoing investigation and responsibility regarding the root causes of sexual and other violence in armed conflict. We support efforts to provide adequate legal, medical and social services to the particular women affected, to witnesses and survivors, and to their family members. Because of the Catholic Church's permanent local presence in the areas of the world most affected by disasters, a network of Catholic institutions and agencies responds rapidly and effectively to address the consequence of violence in armed conflict.  It is always distressing, however, to see that some are still promoting the abortion of unborn children as part of the treatment or response to attacks on their mothers. This contradicts the peace and security mission of the United Nations, and proposes meeting violence with more violence.  It has been observed many times on this organ, and it is true, that women are not only victims but also the necessary agents of and contributors to the work of preventing and resolving conflicts. Without their contributions, Governments, negotiators and civil society groups can neither understand the problems nor propose effective solutions. Moreover, it is important to continue in every Member State the steady and patient work of achieving structural justice for women in every sector of society.

Infavour: Angola, Chad, Chile, China, France, Jordan, Lithuania, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Russian Federation, Spain, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States ofAmerica and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)  The President (spoke in Spanish): The draft resolution received 15 votes in favour. The draft resolution has been adopted, unanimously, as resolution  2242 (2015).  I shall now make a statement in my capacity as President of the Government of Spain.  Gender inequality is a threat to international peace and security. That is one of the main conclusions reached in the work on the issue of women and peace and security that led to resolution 1325 (2000). I would like to add that such inequality is an injustice and is immoral and a hindrance to the progress of humankind. Resolution 2242 (2015), which we have just adopted, is the outcome of the collective efforts of States Members of the United Nations and civil society. We are establishing a renewed, solid and ambitious basis for the upcoming 15 years with regard to the women and peace and security agenda. I would like to highlight the dedication and enthusiasm that everyone has shown in this undertaking, and I wish to highlight the leadership shown by the Secretary-General and express my gratitude to the United Kingdom, the pen-holder with whom we have worked in perfect harmony.  I would also like to thank the Executive Director of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) and representatives of civil society for their contributions during the opening of this debate. Their testimonies have given us the inspiration for this meeting.  Achieving peace, combatting terrorism and developing disarmament processes has a greater chance of being successful if there is growing participation by women. We are pursuing a dual objective with resolution 2242 (2015). First, we are seeking to enhance the protection of women and girls in situations of conflict. We must spare no effort in combating sexual violence, which is used as a weapon of war and terror. Very often, in conflicts, it is more dangerous to be a woman than to be a soldier. Secondly, we are seeking to substantially increase the role played by women in areas ranging from conflict prevention to peacebuilding. Experience has taught us that it is vital to bridge the gaps between what is approved here and what takes place on the ground. Women are key to preserving and building peace. Their contributions are vital in response to the folly of conflicts. In places such as Colombia, the Philippines, Central America, Liberia, Nigeria, Afghanistan and so many others, women present an example of dignity and courage.  Spain has a praiseworthy past in this area. That reflects our total commitment to equality between women and men. At home, we have approved a strategic plan for equal opportunities and a national strategy for the eradication of violence against women. We have a national action plan for the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), and we are promoting a gender focus in peacekeeping missions. Spanish cooperation also has specific guidelines for establishing a strategic relationship with UN-Women and the United Nations Population Fund. Nonetheless, our collective effort with regard to the women and peace and security agenda must be renewed and strengthened, and we commit to do the following.  We will update our national action plan, and we will approve periodic follow-up reports, which will be submitted to our Parliament. We will establish a national focal point and create an international network of focal points. We will involve civil society in designing and providing follow-up to our actions. We will enhance training on gender equality for members of the armed forces and the state security forces, particularly those who are deployed on international missions. We will continue to promote the participation of female soldiers in peacekeeping operations and ensure that women are present in mediation teams. We will continue to strictly implement the zero-tolerance policy with regard to incidents of sexual violence involving members of Spanish civilian and military missions abroad. We will also increase the percentage of our official development assistance earmarked for women and peace and security. We will contribute to funding the Gender Unit within the Department of Political Affairs of the Secretariat in 2016. In addition, in 2016, we will make a contribution ofâ‚¬l million to the new Global Acceleration Instrument for Women, Peace and Security and Humanitarian Action and the multi-agency Fund for Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict.  We must establish certainty and reasons for hope to replace uncertainty and unease. The enhanced protection of women and girls in situations of conflict and a greater role for women in preventing conflict and fostering peacebuilding are necessary for building a fairer, more peaceful and united world. Resolution 2242 (2015) serves as a guide and calls us to act. I invite all gathered here today to roll up our sleeves and work together.  I now resume my functions as President of the Council.

Following consultations among Council members, I have been authorized to make the following statement on their behalf:  ""The Security Council recalls its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.  ""The Security Council recalls the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, and its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, which includes the first internationally agreed definition of the crime of trafficking in persons and provides a framework to effectively prevent and combat trafficking in persons. ""The Security Council condemns in the strongest terms reported instances of trafficking in persons in areas affected by armed conflict. The Security Council further notes that trafficking in persons undermines the rule of law and contributes to other forms of transnational organized crime, which can exacerbate conflict and foster insecurity.  ""The Security Council deplores all acts of trafficking in persons undertaken by the ""Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant"" (ISIL, also known as Daesh), including of Yazidis, as well as all ISIL's violations of international humanitarian law and abuses of human rights, and deplores also any such trafficking in persons and violations and other abuses by the Lord's Resistance Army and other terrorist or armed groups, including Boko Haram, for the purpose of sexual slavery, sexual exploitation and forced labour that may contribute to the funding and sustainment of such groups, and underscores that certain acts associated with trafficking in persons in the context of armed conflict may constitute war crimes.  ""The Security Council reiterates the critical importance ofall Member States fully implementing relevant resolutions with respect to ISIL, including resolutions 2161 (2014), 2170 (2014), 2178 (2014), 2199 (2015) and 2249 (2015). The Security Council further reiterates the critical importance of all Member States fully implementing relevant resolutions, including resolution 2195 (2014), which expresses concern that terrorists benefit from transnational organized crime in some regions, including from the trafficking of persons, as well as resolution 2242 (2015), which expresses concern that acts of sexual and gender-based violence are known to be part of the strategic objectives and ideology of certain terrorist groups.  ""The Security Council calls upon Member States to reinforce their political commitment to and improve their implementation of applicable legal obligations to criminalize, prevent and otherwise combat trafficking in persons, and to strengthen efforts to detect and disrupt trafficking in persons, including implementing robust victim identification mechanisms and providing access to protection and assistance for identified victims, particularly in relation to conflict. The Security Council underscores in this regard the importance of international law enforcement cooperation,  including with respect to investigation and prosecution of trafficking cases, and in this regard calls for the continued support of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in providing technical assistance upon request.  ""The Security Council calls upon Member States to consider ratifying or acceding to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. The Security Council further calls upon States parties to this Convention and to the Protocol to redouble their efforts to implement them effectively.  ""The Security Council takes note of the recommendations made by the Working Group on Trafficking in Persons, established by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, since its inception, and calls upon States to strengthen their efforts in building the necessary political, economic and social conditions to tackle this crime.  ""The Security Council notes the particular impact that trafficking in persons in situations of armed conflict has on women and children, including increasing their vulnerability to sexual and gender-based violence. The Security Council expresses its intention to continue to address this impact, including, as appropriate, in the context of its Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict, within its mandate, and in the framework of its agenda to prevent and address sexual violence in armed conflict.  ""The Security Council expresses solidarity with and compassion for victims of trafficking, including victims of trafficking related to armed conflicts worldwide, and underscores the need for Member States and the United Nations system to proactively identify trafficking victims amongst vulnerable populations, including refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), and address comprehensively victims' needs, including proactive victim identification and, as appropriate, the provision of or access to medical and psycho- social assistance, in the context of the United Nations peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts, as well as ensure that victims of trafficking in persons are treated as victims of crime and, in line with domestic legislation, not penalized or stigmatized for their involvement in any unlawful activities in which they have been compelled to engage.  ""The Security Council calls upon Member States to hold accountable those who engage in trafficking in persons in situations of armed conflict, especially their Government employees and officials, as well as any contractors and subcontractors, and urges Member States to take all appropriate steps to mitigate the risk that their public procurement and supply chains may contribute to trafficking in persons in situations of armed conflict.  ""The Security Council welcomes existing efforts to address sexual exploitation and abuse in the context of United Nations peacekeeping missions, and requests the Secretary-General to identify and take additional steps to prevent and respond robustly to reports of trafficking in persons in United Nations peacekeeping operations, with the objective of ensuring accountability for exploitation.  ""The Security Council requests the Secretary- General to take all appropriate steps to reduce to the greatest extent possible the risk that the United Nations's procurement and supply chains may contribute to the trafficking in persons in situations of armed conflict.  ""The Security Council urges relevant United Nations agencies operating in armed conflict and post-conflict situations to build their technical capacity to assess conflict situations for instances of trafficking in persons, proactively screen for potential victims oftrafficking and facilitate access to needed services for identified victims.  ""The Security Council expresses its intent to continue to address trafficking in persons with respect to the situations on its seizure list.  ""The Security Council requests that the Secretary-General report back to the Council on progress made in 12 months to implement better existing mechanisms countering trafficking in persons and to carry out steps requested in this presidential statement.""  This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2015/25.  Although that may sound a little bureaucratic for our guests here today, that is how we get the United Nations system to work and get things done.

""The Security Council deplores all acts of trafficking in persons undertaken by the ""Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant"" (ISIL, also known as Daesh), including of Yazidis, as well as all ISIL's violations of international humanitarian law and abuses of human rights, and deplores also any such trafficking in persons and violations and other abuses by the Lord's Resistance Army and other terrorist or armed groups, including Boko Haram, for the purpose of sexual slavery, sexual exploitation and forced labour that may contribute to the funding and sustainment of such groups, and underscores that certain acts associated with trafficking in persons in the context of armed conflict may constitute war crimes.  ""The Security Council reiterates the critical importance ofall Member States fully implementing relevant resolutions with respect to ISIL, including resolutions 2161 (2014), 2170 (2014), 2178 (2014), 2199 (2015) and 2249 (2015). The Security Council further reiterates the critical importance of all Member States fully implementing relevant resolutions, including resolution 2195 (2014), which expresses concern that terrorists benefit from transnational organized crime in some regions, including from the trafficking of persons, as well as resolution 2242 (2015), which expresses concern that acts of sexual and gender-based violence are known to be part of the strategic objectives and ideology of certain terrorist groups.  ""The Security Council calls upon Member States to reinforce their political commitment to and improve their implementation of applicable legal obligations to criminalize, prevent and otherwise combat trafficking in persons, and to strengthen efforts to detect and disrupt trafficking in persons, including implementing robust victim identification mechanisms and providing access to protection and assistance for identified victims, particularly in relation to conflict. The Security Council underscores in this regard the importance of international law enforcement cooperation,  including with respect to investigation and prosecution of trafficking cases, and in this regard calls for the continued support of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in providing technical assistance upon request.  ""The Security Council calls upon Member States to consider ratifying or acceding to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. The Security Council further calls upon States parties to this Convention and to the Protocol to redouble their efforts to implement them effectively.  ""The Security Council takes note of the recommendations made by the Working Group on Trafficking in Persons, established by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, since its inception, and calls upon States to strengthen their efforts in building the necessary political, economic and social conditions to tackle this crime.  ""The Security Council notes the particular impact that trafficking in persons in situations of armed conflict has on women and children, including increasing their vulnerability to sexual and gender-based violence. The Security Council expresses its intention to continue to address this impact, including, as appropriate, in the context of its Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict, within its mandate, and in the framework of its agenda to prevent and address sexual violence in armed conflict.  ""The Security Council expresses solidarity with and compassion for victims of trafficking, including victims of trafficking related to armed conflicts worldwide, and underscores the need for Member States and the United Nations system to proactively identify trafficking victims amongst vulnerable populations, including refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), and address comprehensively victims' needs, including proactive victim identification and, as appropriate, the provision of or access to medical and psycho- social assistance, in the context of the United Nations peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts, as well as ensure that victims of trafficking in persons are treated as victims of crime and, in line with domestic legislation, not penalized or stigmatized for their involvement in any unlawful activities in which they have been compelled to engage.  ""The Security Council calls upon Member States to hold accountable those who engage in trafficking in persons in situations of armed conflict, especially their Government employees and officials, as well as any contractors and subcontractors, and urges Member States to take all appropriate steps to mitigate the risk that their public procurement and supply chains may contribute to trafficking in persons in situations of armed conflict.  ""The Security Council welcomes existing efforts to address sexual exploitation and abuse in the context of United Nations peacekeeping missions, and requests the Secretary-General to identify and take additional steps to prevent and respond robustly to reports of trafficking in persons in United Nations peacekeeping operations, with the objective of ensuring accountability for exploitation.  ""The Security Council requests the Secretary- General to take all appropriate steps to reduce to the greatest extent possible the risk that the United Nations's procurement and supply chains may contribute to the trafficking in persons in situations of armed conflict.  ""The Security Council urges relevant United Nations agencies operating in armed conflict and post-conflict situations to build their technical capacity to assess conflict situations for instances of trafficking in persons, proactively screen for potential victims oftrafficking and facilitate access to needed services for identified victims.  ""The Security Council expresses its intent to continue to address trafficking in persons with respect to the situations on its seizure list.  ""The Security Council requests that the Secretary-General report back to the Council on progress made in 12 months to implement better existing mechanisms countering trafficking in persons and to carry out steps requested in this presidential statement.""  This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2015/25.  Although that may sound a little bureaucratic for our guests here today, that is how we get the United Nations system to work and get things done. I would add that it is very important that the Security Council has spoken on these issues for the first time.  I shall now give the floor to the members of the Security Council.  "

UNSC_2015_SPV.7585_spch025.txt,2015,7585,"The President: I shall now make a statement in my national capacity as the representative of the United States.  Let me join others in thanking our guest briefers - Deputy Secretary-General Eliasson, Executive Director Fedotov and Mr. Grono - both for their briefings and for their efforts in the real world to combat human trafficking.  Nadia, I cannot imagine how painful it must be every time you are asked to recount your experience. No human being should be forced to endure what you and your family have gone through - ever. Your being here and speaking so bravely to all of us is a testament to your resilience and your dignity, and is of course the most powerful rejection of what the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) stands for.  We have been here now for two hours and 15 minutes. It is worth remembering that, in that time, women and kids and others are living in circumstances just like those that Nadia have described. As we sit here, they are being terrorized. And they are dreaming of their escape, desperate to get out but trapped by brute force and nothing more. We have been talking about ISIL in the Security Council since at least early 2014. But Nadia, you have humanized the stakes in a way that I think has been extremely important for people to hear. I do not think that anyone who was able to hear you will ever forget what they heard and what you have been through. We are truly in awe of your courage. I also agree with the comment that was just made that, at a time when refugee admissions and the flight of individuals is being politicized and refugees are being caricatured in different ways, your experience and your testimony is a powerful rebuke to those who would caricature this whole population, when people are fleeing for their lives, fleeing terror and conflict and sexual violence. We should never forget that.  Today we as a Council are meeting for the first time on the issue of human trafficking in conflict. Historic as this is, it is a bit baffling that the Council has not taken on this issue before. We have up to now met on trafficking in arms, oil, antiquities, natural resources and Wildlife, but this was our first meeting on the trafficking in human beings. Almost everywhere we see conflict in the world, as others have said, we see human trafficking. Human trafficking thrives in conflict, and conflict is exacerbated by human trafficking.  It is no coincidence that the illicit trade in weapons, drugs, stolen antiquities and other illegal goods tend to follow routes similar to those used by human traffickers and be carried out by the same criminal networks. These illicit activities sustain armed groups, terrorists and criminal networks and threaten international peace and security. In addition, traffickers often force their own victims to commit crimes, such as participating in terrorist acts, transporting illegal weapons and producing illegal drugs, and these crimes themselves, of course, further undermine our shared security.  We have seen how the Governments, armed groups and terrorists that treat people as property often show similar disdain for the rules and norms that ensure our shared security. Yet, despite persistent efforts to eradicate trafficking in persons by the United Nations and other international bodies, Governments and civil- society groups, this crime persists. The statistics, as others have noted, are staggering. According to the International Labour Organization, at least 20 million people worldwide are victims of forced labour. An estimated 5.5 million ofthem are children - 5.5 million children. Making matters worse, as Mr. Grono observed, the taboo against slavery is being actively and  willfully challenged by ISIL and Boko Haram, which do not just carry out widespread human trafficking; they brag about it on social media and in propaganda materials. ISIL distributes women and girls to fighters as spoils of war, systematically rapes them and sells them in markets like cattle. Boys as young as 4 years old are forced into cub training camps, where they are reportedly given dolls on which to practice beheadings. It is barbaric.  ISIL has even gone so far as to issue guidelines to its followers on how to treat their slaves, providing a twisted justification for the most depraved acts. The guidelines state: ""It is permissible to buy, sell or give as a gift female captives and slaves, for they are merely property which can be disposed of"". And they tell followers, ""It is permissible to have intercourse with a female slave who has not reached puberty"". In other words, raping female slaves is authorized; it is acceptable; it is encouraged. When we try to describe evil like this, we find ourselves groping for language; words fail us. We are amazed that Nadia was able to speak about the unspeakable and find words, and we thank her for that.  The stories of Boko Haram's depravity are also shocking. On 2 October, the group reportedly forced four girls and a boy to blow themselves up in the Nigerian city of Maiduguri. Three of them attacked a mosque during evening prayers. Fifteen people, including these kids, were killed, and more than 35 were injured. Witnesses estimated that the bombers were as young as 9 years old.  Martha, age 14, was abducted by Boko Haram along with her two sisters in September 2014. She was taken to one of the group's camps, and she later told a reporter, ""They told me not to walk around outside, and when I did they would beat me. They told me not to talk, and I would talk, so they would beat me. They told me not to sing, I would sing, and they would beat me"". She was forced to convert to Islam, assigned a new name and married against her will to a fighter. Martha said she was forced to carry extra ammunition for Boko Haram fighters on two of their operations. ""They wanted me to kill people,"" she said, ""but I could never bring myself to kill anyone"". She said, ""Boko Haram members tried to force my sister to kill an old man. When she refused, they shot her instead."" One night, Martha and two of the girls escaped into the bush. ""I am still struggling with the memories"", she said.  For groups such as ISIL and Boko Haram, slavery has become one of their most versatile weapons of war, used to instil fear, to inflict suffering, to recruit followers, reward fighters, convert people of other faiths, reward combatants and generate revenue, and they are learning from one another's worst practices. It is a grotesque race to the bottom.  So what can we, and by we I mean all States Members of the United Nations, all civilized communities, what can we do to root out this scourge? Of course, we must condemn these file crimes and those who commit them, and we must continue to document the horrors, so that one day those responsible can be held accountable. We must also commit ourselves to ending the conflicts that provide an ideal climate for human traffickers, and of course we must commit ourselves to eradicating the groups that use human trafficking as a weapon of war.  To that end, under President Obama's leadership, the United States has organized a coalition of 65 countries to degrade and destroy ISIL and spurred efforts in the Security Council to curb the flows of foreign terrorist fighters and the illicit funds that extremist groups use to fuel their terror. The session that United States Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew will chair tomorrow, when many other Council finance ministers willjoin him, will aim to strengthen Member States' efforts to cut off ISIL's financing.  Similarly, we continue to provide security and counter-terrorism assistance to the Governments of Chad, Nigeria, the Niger, Cameroon and Benin to aid their fight against Boko Haram. We are also continuing to partner with African countries to take on the Lord's Resistance Army and Joseph Kony, who remains at large. The Lord's resistance Army has been decimated in recent years, but every day it exists and Joseph Kony is at large is a day in which children, women and civilian communities everywhere are at risk of abduction, and the abductees, as all here know, are then forced themselves into abducting others. In some cases you have children being asked to abduct and kill other children. It is monstrous. So that effort, too, is essential.  Beyond these efforts to end conflicts, in which human trafficking thrives, and to go after the worst perpetrators, we must also ask what each of our Governments can do to ensure that we are not ourselves helping to fuel the crime of human trafficking.  First, we must work to ensure that our own practices, from procurement to distribution, do not themselves contribute to human trafficking. This means taking steps to require Government contractors and subcontractors to prohibit activities known to contribute to trafficking, such as making it illegal to charge workers recruitment fees that can lead to debt bondage. By putting in place such requirements and protections, Governments can show that they are practicing What they preach when it comes to cutting modern slavery out of supply chains, and we can each model best practices for the private sector.  Secondly, we have to teach people how to actually see the victims of trafficking. This can be extremely challenging. Some victims of trafficking go out of their way to avoid being identified, out of fear for their safety or that of their loved ones, out of fear of being deported or otherwise criminalized. And when the victims of trafficking are seen, they are seen too often as criminals. People see only the crime that these individuals have committed and not the force, fraud, coercion and terror that led them to do so. Learning to see trafficking victims demands sensitizing people at all levels of Government and across the spectrum of agencies, and it demands engaging partners outside of Governments such as faith-based organizations, business owners, teachers, health-care providers - those that are most likely to come into contact with victims.  Consider one of the populations at highest risk of trafficking: internationally displaced persons, namely, refugees fleeing conflict areas. As we all know, nearly 60 million people are currently displaced by conflicts, more than at any other time since the Second World War. Yet aid workers, peacekeepers and other groups that come into close contact with these vulnerable individuals often lack the training to spot the signs of trafficking, and even those with the training often have extremely limited resources to assist the victims who are identified. This is a massive gap, and we must all work to fill it. I credit Jordan, which has taken in more than 628,000 Syrian refugees, as we all know, but Jordan also recently built its first shelter dedicated exclusively to housing and assisting trafficking victims.  To give another example, in the United States, the Department of Transportation and Homeland Security have teamed up to train some 50,000 airline employees in how to safely identify suspected instances of human trafficking and alert law-enforcement authorities in real time. Thirdly, we need to spur more robust and innovative solutions. Others have rightly highlighted the enormous disparity between the $150 billion in profits estimated to be generated annually by forced labour and the amount spent by countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development annually on anti-trafficking development assistance, which is less than one tenth of a 1 per cent of the amount the traffickers are taking in.  But we do not just need more resources; we need resources to be more victim- and survivor-centred. Time and again, we have seen that incorporating victims and survivors into the policymaking process yields better solutions, and they can offer the kind of perspective that Nadia offered us here today. To that end, the United States Government will soon be launching the first-ever United States advisory council on human trafficking, made up exclusively of survivors, to help inform and guide our federal policies and programmes to combat trafficking and empower victims.  On 6 December 1865, the United States adopted the Thirteenth Amendment to our Constitution, which abolished slavery. Before it was adopted, generations of men, women and children were enslaved in this country in the most deplorable conditions. People were born, lived and died in chains. It took fighting a brutal civil war in which more than 600,000 lost their lives - one out of every 50 Americans - for this practice to be abolished. Even after the war ended and the Amendment was adopted, the practice of forced labour endured in other forms, as we know, and the legacy of slavery is still acutely felt in our nation to this day.  Speaking on the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the Amendment's adoption, President Obama appropriately quoted President Abraham Lincoln:  ""In giving freedom to the slave we ensure freedom to the free - honourable alike in what we give, and what we preserve.""  Lincoln was referring to efforts to emancipate slaves in this country, but his words can just as easily be applied to the Security Council today. Right now we find victims of human trafficking in every one of our countries. We eat food that they harvest. We speak on telephones built from minerals that they mine. We wear clothes that they make. The Security Council is built on the premise that the peace and security of our nations is bound up in one anothers'. But as Lincoln understood, so are human rights.  Everyone of us here knows in our core that human trafficking is wrong. We know that modern slavery is inhuman. We know that no one should ever have to endure what Nadia and so many women and girls and others are enduring right here as we sit and as we discuss. If we know that, then what Lincoln told Americans so many years ago also holds true for us here on this day: our freedom and our dignity are bound up with the fates of millions of victims of trafficking, such as Nadia, victims who possess tremendous dignity and courage. We ensure our freedom by fighting to give them their freedom.  The meeting rose at 5.35 pm.

We thank the Secretary-General for presenting to the Security Council his report (A/70/229) on special measures on protection from sexual exploitation and abuse, which provides an analysis and strategies to counter this outrageous phenomenon in the United Nations system. We welcome the holding of this debate, which affords the members of the Council an opportunity to renew their political support to the Secretary-General in implementing the zero-tolerance policy against sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers, as well as our resolve in condemning such actions.  The report of the Secretary-General refers to an increase in the number of alleged cases in 2015, following a decrease in 2014, involving a relatively high proportion of minors and non-consensual relations involving adults - with cases in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic reaching a peak. Angola strongly condemns violence against civilians, in particular sexually related violence - against women, girls and boys - by United Nations peacekeepers. We therefore fully support the Secretary-General's zero-tolerance policy and welcome the continuous commitment and strengthening of measures aimed at accountability based on the principles of transparency and impartiality. We are encouraged by his renewed commitment to ensure that reported allegations are fully and promptly investigated, in cooperation with troop-contributing countries, to ensure that those responsible are held accountable.  In that regard, we deem predeployment training as an essential tool to avoid misconduct and ensure that troops strictly respect the Organization's standards of conduct. It is important to systematically include the prevention of conflict-related sexual violence and its follow-up in the relevant country-specific resolutions and the mandates of special political and peacekeeping missions. Furthermore, increasing the number of women in peacekeeping operations and police units can help combat stigma and threats of reprisal, which impede victims from reporting. We welcome the Secretary- General's plan to develop a community-based complaint reception mechanism - a measure that I am sure will help to address the fear among victims that we see today. We also suppor the proposal that troop-contributing countries enter into bilateral agreements with the Office of Internal Oversight Services to authorize it to investigate alleged cases by members of military contingents, either independently or in cooperation with national investigation officers. Other measures, such as better-calibrated rotation schedules, adequate provision of welfare programmes and better standards of living for troops and the regular payment of salaries to uniformed personnel, are sensible measures capable of addressing the need for a reduction in such cases.  We have just returned from a Council mission to Mali, where we saw a peacekeeping mission deployed under the most challenging circumstances. We pay special tribute to those heroic peacekeepers, not just in Mali but in other theatres, in very special circumstances, who unfortunately see their work being tarnished by the actions of a few. We should act on this issue very vigorously.  We took good note of the recommendations by the external independent panel to review the United Natins response, and especially ofthe Secretary-General's clear and forward-looking proposals to strengthen measures to prevent and protect and to enforce accountability, management and remedial action in response to sexual exploitation and abuse.  Finally, we have taken note of the draft resolution presented by the United States. We are ready to continue work on it in a constructive spirit in order to achieve a Council document that is the good product we would like to see put in place.  I now resume my functions as President of the Council.  I now give the floor to the Secretary-General.  ",The President,,English,u," I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Angola.  We thank the Secretary-General for presenting to the Security Council his report (A/70/229) on special measures on protection from sexual exploitation and abuse, which provides an analysis and strategies to counter this outrageous phenomenon in the United Nations system. We welcome the holding of this debate, which affords the members of the Council an opportunity to renew their political support to the Secretary-General in implementing the zero-tolerance policy against sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers, as well as our resolve in condemning such actions.

I shall now make a statement in my national capacity as the Minister for Family and the Promotion of Women of Angola.  It is a great honour to address the Security Council on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Angola and to offer some insights on the important issue of women and peace and security, with particular emphasis on the role of women in conflict prevention and resolution in Africa.  I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to the briefers for their significant contributions to the subject matter under consideration. I welcome the Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director of UN-Women, Ms. Phumzile Mlambo- Ngcuka; the Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Mr. Taye-Brook Zerihoun; the Chair of the Peacebuilding Commission, Ambassador Macharia Kamau; Ambassador Tete Antonio, Permanent Observer of the African Union; and Ms. Paleki Ayang of the South Sudan Women's Empowerment Network.  The African continent is still engulfed in conflict situations, some of them dragging on for more than a generation. Civil strife and fratricidal conflicts have greatly affected the social, economic and human development of the continent. Besides the colonial legacy, policies of social and political exclusion, coupled with widespread economic inequalities and violations of human rights, are relevant root causes of those conflicts. Such situations have exacted a heavy burden, primarily on the civilian populations of the countries affected, as well as on the international community, which has been required to intervene in order to contain the spillover effects of the conflicts.  It is universally understood that prevention is the most effective way to avoid the human, social and financial costs caused by conflicts. It is also understood that the best means to prevent conflict is to build societies based on principles of inclusivity, with equal rights accorded to all citizens without exclusion or discrimination and with the prevalence of the rule of law. It is also understood that the resolution of conflicts should take place through the channels of dialogue, mediation and the compatibility of diverging interests, which is possible only when dialogue and mediation lead to meaningful compromise and everybody's interests are safeguarded.  The Security Council is currently dealing with a large number of such conflicts - deploying military means through peacekeeping operations, after the signing of peace deals and managing post-conflict situations. The Council has also established a number ofpolitical special missions ofa preventive nature, and the Secretary-General or his envoys have exercised good offices and mediation efforts to seek to avert the outbreak of conflicts.  In the search for more effective means to deal with conflict situations, in 2015 the Secretary-General launched three major peace and security reviews. They include the High-level Independent Panel on United Nations Peace Operations, the Advisory Group of Experts for the Review of Peacebuilding Architecture and the global study on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security.  The reviews agreed on the postulate that the greatest responsibility of the international community is the prevention of armed conflict and highlighted the critical need for greater investment in prevention strategies. The reviews furthermore stressed the value added of the women and peace and security agenda to conflict prevention and the potential for early warning in gender-sensitive analysis by identifying the drivers of conflict, such as changing dynamics, namely, at family and community-level relations. It also highlighted that conflict prevention could be greatly improved by engaging with women, given their grass-roots knowledge, especially in providing relevant indicators for dealing with the threats of conflict and for the implementation of preventive measures.  The global study on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) recognizes the importance of enhancing the role of women and of their participation at all phases and levels ofpeace processes, given its potential for accelerating the attainment of solutions to conflict and the sustainability of peace. Women's participation in the prevention and resolution of conflicts can take on different forms and dimensions, inter alia, direct involvement in formal peace negotiations, consultative commissions, public policies, decision-making, national dialogues, peacebuilding and comprehensive reforms, leading to democratization processes.  In addition, besides ensuring the inclusion of gender-sensitive language in peace agreements, women can bring more than gender issues to the negotiating table by instilling the holistic approach that a peace process entails. The global study refers to paradigmatic cases in Liberia, Kenya and Burundi, where women's groups have achieved significant results through the exercise of a strong influence in the negotiating processes, by exerting pressure for the start and conclusion of negotiations and, in some cases, mobilizing for the signing of a peace agreement or, alternatively, promoting measures to prevent a new cycle of violence, addressing the root causes of conflict, thereby contributing to changing power relations in society.  Women and children are the main victims in today's armed conflicts. Therefore, their participation in those processes becomes a crucial issue. Their voices must be heard in the prevention of conflict, in the negotiation of  peace settlements and in ensuring that their interests are taken into account in post-conflict reconstruction. It is of pivotal importance that the institutional mechanisms established in Africa promote an environment conducive to the meaningful participation of women in peace and security, while reasserting the full commitments of the African States to that objective.  The Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, the African Union Solemn Declaration on Gender Equality in Africa, the African Union's five-year Gender, Peace and Security Programme and the emphasis on women's leadership on issues related to peace and security are achievements translating a renewed awareness of the essential role played by women.  Women in Angola have participated decisively in all efforts towards the attainment of peace. The immediate post-conflict period included women's direct involvement in peacebuilding and national reconstruction. Women were instrumental in providing psychological support to the victims of the armed conflict as counsellors of peace, national reconciliation and social healing. The Government established counselling centres to raise awareness on their economic, social, political and civil rights and as a tool for families' participation in the country's development.  Through partnerships with civil society organizations, efforts have been deployed in order to strengthen women's participation in the country's political and economic life. The non-governmental organization Roots of Peace was created with the aim of bringing together women from all political parties represented in Parliament to participate in the efforts to consolidate peace and democracy. Angola joined the campaign He for She, which is aimed at raising the awareness of men and boys for the eradication of all forms of gender-based violence.  Angola has been playing a role in the preservation of peace and security in Africa, especially in the Great Lakes region, in promoting a culture of peace based on experience gained in conflict-prevention processes, in the promotion of dialogue and national reconciliation. Today, we have many women at all levels of the army and the police. In my delegation, we have a woman brigadier. Women also participate in electoral observer missions.  Finally, it is our expectation that the new awareness on the key role women play in social, political and economic life will lead to a world where women can effectively carry out their responsibilities and fully exercise of their rights. We are sure that if strong political will and commitment are fully brought into action towards the attainment of such goals, women will make a tangible contribution to building a more just and peaceful world.

Today's debate provides a timely opportunity to reflect on the results of the high-level review of the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), and to focus on the needs and perspectives of Africa. Brazil took note with satisfaction of the recommendations of the global study on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and, in particular, its emphasis on prevention and the need to avoid the militarization of the women and peace and security agenda. As highlighted by the global study, increasing recognition of women's participation and empowerment is an end in itself and should not be part of counterterrorism strategies or efforts to prevent violent extremism conducive to terrorism; rather, it should be a part of the civilian peace agenda. That point is highly relevant for Africa, where most peacekeeping operations are deployed and where women's organizations have been playing and will continue to play a positive role in all peace processes, from mediation and prevention initiatives to reconciliation and reconstruction in the aftermath of conflict.  Notwithstanding significant challenges, African women have many success stories to tell. Women's organizations were at the forefront of the Liberian peace process. Post-conflict recovery initiatives led to the economic empowerment of thousands of women in Burundi and Rwanda. The policies and instruments of the African Union Gender Policy, as well as the Gender, Peace and Security Programme of the African Peace and Security Architecture, provide valuable tools to support the empowerment of African women as agents of peace. We also welcome the adoption last year of the African Union Agenda 2063 and its pledge to empower African women in all spheres of social life. It is also heartening to note that three important peacekeeping operations in Africa are now led by women. We pay tribute to the commitment and leadership of Ellen Margrethe Loj, the Head of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan; Ai'chatou Mindaoudou, the Head of the United Nations Operation in Cote d'Ivoire; and Kim Bolduc, the Head of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara. Another woman, Hester Paneras, until recently steered the world's largest international police component - that of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur.  Yet this positive trend cannot offset the fact that women constitute merely 4 per cent of the 88,000 troops and police personnel currently deployed in United Nations peacekeeping operations in Africa. In that regard, we recall resolution 2242 (2015), which calls upon the Secretary-General and Member States to double the number of women in military and police contingents of United Nations peacekeeping operations over the next five years. Female peacekeepers are uniquely well placed to build trust with local communities and to address sexual and gender-based violence. They also serve as role models to inspire women and girls to seek more rights and participation in our societies.  In recognizing and supporting women's role as agents of peace, the international community is also contributing to address one of the direst aspects of war that mostly affects women and girls. Sexual violence in conflict remains a serious concern for vulnerable populations impacted by war around the world, predominantly women and girls. Despite the strong African commitment to fighting sexual and gender- based violence, serious crimes against humanity, involving rape and sexual slavery, continue to occur in some regions of Africa. Brazil strongly condemns these abhorrent violations. We have long upheld the imperative to pursue accountability for serious crimes and abuses against women and girls, including but not limited to sexual and gender-based violence.  A milestone in this regard was the recent International Criminal Court (ICC) trial, presided over by Brazilian Judge Sylvia Steiner, leading to the conviction of Jean-Pierre Bemba for war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Central African Republic. This was the first ICC case to specifically focus on the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, and should serve as a powerful deterrent to would- be perpetrators. As the current Chair of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), I am deeply committed to gender equality in all political and security processes. A specific concern are the human rights of women of African origin, who are often subject to discrimination and prejudice outside Africa. In this spirit, Brazil and the United States co-organized last week a CSW side event on the racial identity of women of African descent in the diaspora, in the context of the 2015-2024 International Decade for People of African Descent. We believe that visibility and self-representation are powerful strategies for tackling racism and injustice.  Our South-South cooperation with Africa, a key priority of Brazilian foreign policy, is closely aligned with the women and peace and security agenda. In Guinea-Bissau, we helped enable health institutions to assist women and girl victims of gender-based violence. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we have financed projects to assist victims of sexual and gender-based violence. In this respect, I cannot fail to refer to the inspiring work of Dr. Denis Mukwege, a physician who has treated thousands of survivors of rape in Bukavu, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and a role model not just in Africa, but worldwide.  Through the Guinea-Bissau configuration of the Peacebuilding Commission, I have witnessed first- hand the essential role played by women in building sustainable peace. The Brazilian Peace Operations Joint Training Center in Rio de Janeiro regularly holds workshops and courses to train peacekeepers on gender issues and the protection of women, where rigorous standards regarding the conduct and discipline of personnel are upheld.  At the domestic level, let me highlight the drafting process of our national action plan on women and peace and security. We are striving to elaborate an effective plan to address the four pillars of the agenda: prevention, protection, participation, and peacebuilding and recovery. This will include but will not be limited to measures to increase the percentage of female peacekeepers; to foster the participation of women in all peace and security processes, including in our Foreign and Defence Ministries; to further improve relations between troops and civilians, particularly women and girls, in peacekeeping operations; and to fortify humanitarian assistance and technical cooperation initiatives on gender issues in conflict and post-conflict situations. Since the women and peace and security agenda is not solely a Government matter, we have established a broad-based working group comprising representatives not only of relevant ministries and the armed forces, but also of academia and civil society, to debate and draft our national action plan.  In conclusion, let me reiterate Brazil's firm commitment to both the promotion of peace in Africa and the crosscutting campaign on gender equality and women's empowerment. We will continue to advance these inseparable agendas at all levels of the United Nations.  The President: I give the floor to the representative of India.

I warmly thank everyone for their concrete and very useful interventions, which reflect a consensus - a unanimous will - to halt the unacceptable and revolting phenomenon of sexual violence and trafficking in women and children in conflict situations. I would like to recognize in particular the efforts of the Secretary- General and the personal engagement of his Special Representative, Ms. Zainab Bangura. She has not only met victims of conflict in the field, but has also had the strength to propose ways of combating sexual violence in situations of crisis or conflict. The insight provided in that context by the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, Ms. Giammarinaro, on the particular plight of women and girls was particularly striking. Finally, the testimony of Ms. Davis here in the Council called for intensified efforts to address the causes and consequences of the various forms of gender- based violence. The consequences of sex trafficking in women and children in conflict have been clearly identified and recalled today. On the one hand, they destroy lives, entire families and community social ties and serve to cast out the victims and children born of rape. On the other hand, sex trafficking directly fuels terrorism, not just by increasing the financial resources of such groups but also by attracting new recruits through forced marriage promises or ""sexual compensation"" - abominable acts carried out by the likes of Da'esh.  Faced with those well-known tragic consequences, the causes of trafficking for sexual purposes should be better taken into account. They are based on gender inequality, which is the first stage towards commodifying the bodies ofwomen and girls. To remedy that situation, among other things, the empowerment of women must be strengthened in the areas of education and health, where they must have access to appropriate services. That includes in particular access to abortion in cases of rape in conflict situations, including in refugee camps. It is an essential right for every woman to make her own decision, which France has made a priority. It is each Member State's responsibility to take all necessary measures to give women autonomy, political and economic power, and control of their bodies. That decision-making power and freedom of choice cannot be nuanced or relativized by culture or customs in any country or society.  The Security Council also has a collective responsibility in the fight against sex trafficking. The Council's inadequate treatment of gender issues owing to disagreements among its members hinders the improvement of the status of women in conflict. Similarly, sexual violence in conflict situations and the women and peace and security agenda are too often considered separate from the threats to international peace and security considered by the Council daily.  In reality, sexual violence is among the strategies used by terrorist groups, such as Da'esh or Boko Haram, and poses a short- and long-term threat to international peace and security. We see that in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia and elsewhere. Children born of sexual violence today may become the criminals or terrorists of tomorrow. That is why I would like to present four proposals for action by the Security Council and the Secretariat on this topic.  First, we must strengthen the protection of civilians mandates for peacekeeping operations through the establishment of specialized monitoring units, comprised of human rights experts and police and judiciary cooperation in order to better identify risks through patrols, detect the markets for women and dismantle trafficking networks. The open debate to be presided over by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, Jean-Marc Ayrault, on 10 June, will provide an opportunity to talk more about that possibility.  Secondly, we should better integrate the issue of human trafficking into Council discussions. Presidential statement S/PRST/2015/25 of December last year was an important step in that regard, as is the report of the Secretary-General that the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime is currently working on, which will be presented to the Council in December 2016. Further work to identify individuals and entities who, through their involvement in trafficking for sexual violence, finance terrorist groups is also necessary, including through the activities of the Sanctions Committees.  Thirdly, we need to more systematically integrate crimes with a sexual dimension into the mediation and negotiation efforts of peace or ceasefire agreements. They must be considered a breach of ceasefires, just like other atrocities.  Finally, we must strengthen the role and participation of women in strategies to combat trafficking and terrorism, particularly in the context of the tenth anniversary of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. Particular attention should be paid to combating the real and virtual markets in which women and children are traded and sold with impunity. Combating impunity in this field is a priority in and of itself, and our mobilization in that regard is essential.  Let me conclude my remarks by welcoming the Secretary-General's commitment to zero tolerance of all forms of sexual violence, including sexual abuse and exploitation. We must all serve as an example, in the context of United Nations-mandated missions and elsewhere. It is crucial that the United Nations, just like Member States, adopt concrete measures to prevent and fight against all forms of sexual violence. France has already implemented a broad spectrum of measures in that regard and has reported on them to the Security Council and the General Assembly. Our determination on that issue is unwavering.  Today's debate is crucial for identifying the challenges and solutions regarding sex trafficking. The Security Council now has the collective responsibility to implement the most effective solutions and to remain mobilized on those issues. The first commemoration of the International Day for the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict is to be held this month on 19 June. It will provide an opportunity to maintain the mobilization of the international community on this priority issue for France and for the United Nations.  I now resume my functions as President of the Council.  I wish to remind all speakers to limit their statements to no more than four minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber. I would like to appeal to speakers to deliver their statements at a normal speed so that interpretation can be provided accurately.  I now give the floor to the representative of Sweden.

Faced with those well-known tragic consequences, the causes of trafficking for sexual purposes should be better taken into account. They are based on gender inequality, which is the first stage towards commodifying the bodies ofwomen and girls. To remedy that situation, among other things, the empowerment of women must be strengthened in the areas of education and health, where they must have access to appropriate services. That includes in particular access to abortion in cases of rape in conflict situations, including in refugee camps. It is an essential right for every woman to make her own decision, which France has made a priority. It is each Member State's responsibility to take all necessary measures to give women autonomy, political and economic power, and control of their bodies. That decision-making power and freedom of choice cannot be nuanced or relativized by culture or customs in any country or society.  The Security Council also has a collective responsibility in the fight against sex trafficking. The Council's inadequate treatment of gender issues owing to disagreements among its members hinders the improvement of the status of women in conflict. Similarly, sexual violence in conflict situations and the women and peace and security agenda are too often considered separate from the threats to international peace and security considered by the Council daily.  In reality, sexual violence is among the strategies used by terrorist groups, such as Da'esh or Boko Haram, and poses a short- and long-term threat to international peace and security. We see that in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia and elsewhere. Children born of sexual violence today may become the criminals or terrorists of tomorrow. That is why I would like to present four proposals for action by the Security Council and the Secretariat on this topic.  First, we must strengthen the protection of civilians mandates for peacekeeping operations through the establishment of specialized monitoring units, comprised of human rights experts and police and judiciary cooperation in order to better identify risks through patrols, detect the markets for women and dismantle trafficking networks. The open debate to be presided over by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, Jean-Marc Ayrault, on 10 June, will provide an opportunity to talk more about that possibility.  Secondly, we should better integrate the issue of human trafficking into Council discussions. Presidential statement S/PRST/2015/25 of December last year was an important step in that regard, as is the report of the Secretary-General that the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime is currently working on, which will be presented to the Council in December 2016. Further work to identify individuals and entities who, through their involvement in trafficking for sexual violence, finance terrorist groups is also necessary, including through the activities of the Sanctions Committees.  Thirdly, we need to more systematically integrate crimes with a sexual dimension into the mediation and negotiation efforts of peace or ceasefire agreements. They must be considered a breach of ceasefires, just like other atrocities.  Finally, we must strengthen the role and participation of women in strategies to combat trafficking and terrorism, particularly in the context of the tenth anniversary of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. Particular attention should be paid to combating the real and virtual markets in which women and children are traded and sold with impunity. Combating impunity in this field is a priority in and of itself, and our mobilization in that regard is essential.  Let me conclude my remarks by welcoming the Secretary-General's commitment to zero tolerance of all forms of sexual violence, including sexual abuse and exploitation. We must all serve as an example, in the context of United Nations-mandated missions and elsewhere. It is crucial that the United Nations, just like Member States, adopt concrete measures to prevent and fight against all forms of sexual violence. France has already implemented a broad spectrum of measures in that regard and has reported on them to the Security Council and the General Assembly. Our determination on that issue is unwavering.  Today's debate is crucial for identifying the challenges and solutions regarding sex trafficking. The Security Council now has the collective responsibility to implement the most effective solutions and to remain mobilized on those issues. The first commemoration of the International Day for the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict is to be held this month on 19 June. It will provide an opportunity to maintain the mobilization of the international community on this priority issue for France and for the United Nations.  I now resume my functions as President of the Council.

Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.

Next year my country - and, we believe, others far from its borders - will mark the centenary of an event that has left a deep imprint on world history, the October Revolution. As we look back on it today, our assessments of its impact may be mixed, but one is indisputable - it enshrined the full equality for women in our country that has become firmly established on the global socioeconomic and political agenda. In a certain sense, the work the Security Council has been doing in the past 16 years is a continuation of that process, begun a century ago.  Since 2000, the Security Council has traditionally held an open debate on women and peace and security in the month of October. Sixteen years ago, our delegation wholeheartedly supported the Security Council's consideration of this agenda item. As Mr. Sergey Lavrov, the then Permanent Representative of Russia to the United Nations, noted at the Council's first meeting on the subject, women  ""are an enormous strength and can provide invaluable assistance in reconciling belligerents and tending the wounds of war"" (S/PV4208, p. 21).  The annual debate in the Council always evokes great interest among delegations and presents a good opportunity for analysing progress in achieving the goals that have been set and how to increase the effectiveness of our efforts. In the years since the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), much has been done to turn its provisions into concrete action aimed at improving the protection of women in armed conflicts and ensuring their full and effective participation in efforts to prevent and resolve conflicts. The women and peace and security agenda has had increasing attention both from the Security Council and the United Nations system in general, as the Secretary-General's latest report (S/2016/822) testifies. While it is vital to ensure that the work begun continues, it is important to ensure that in developing complex approaches we do not end up neglecting the specifics of a given situation, and that the inclusion of gender perspectives in that work does not become an end in itself. The best results come when we avoid grandstanding and focus on specific returns. That fully applies to developing national action plans, which can be an effective tool for concerned States when they become involved in an armed conflict.  Where my country is concerned, we are not about to start preparing this type of national plan. Instead, work is under way in Russia on a document of a different kind - the Russian Federation's national strategy for action for women 2017 -2022. Its key areas of focus include increasing women's participation in political life and the decision-making process; improving their economic situation, including promoting entrepreneurship for women; creating conditions conducive to better women's health; preventing violence and protecting women from it; and overcoming stereotypes about men's and women's social roles.  We should point out that in our country women occupy a number of leading Government posts - the President of the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly, Deputy Prime Minister, President of the Central Bank, the Ministers of Health and Education and a number of other responsible positions. Women also play a very significant part in the work of the State Duma. They make up 17 per cent - six of 36 officers - of Russian police contingents abroad.  We agree with the Secretary-General's recommendation on the need to strengthen the coordination of United Nations entities in order to accommodate gender mainstreaming in the context of armed conflict. However, it is important to ensure that they avoid duplication and contradictory action and that their efforts are based on reliable sources of information. The programmes and projects produced by the Secretariat's experts should be submitted for intergovernmental discussion and follow-up approval. It is after all the States that play the lead role in implementing the women and peace and security agenda.  No less important is ensuring that the Security Council's work is focused on issues related to its mandate. Artificially connecting the entire gamut of gender issues to Council activity will lead to an imbalance from the point of view of system- wide coordination and create obstacles to effective implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). The Council should focus its attention primarily on the situation of women in extremely serious, large-scale armed conflicts. That goal corresponds to the inclusion of a gender component in the Secretary-General's reports on specific country situations. Needless to say, that does not diminish the urgent task of combating threats women's lives and security caused by the barbarities of terrorist groups.  I would like to once again affirm our belief in the importance of ensuring that the international community gives proper attention to the situation of women in armed conflict and their participation in peacemaking. At the same time, of course, we should remember that there is no more reliable way to protect humankind, including women and children, from the horrors ofwar than resolving crisis situations as quickly as possible.  In conclusion, I am compelled to make one more observation. Not for the first time, today the representative of Ukraine strayed a long way beyond the confines of our discussion to touch on the general topic of the conflict in eastern Ukraine. That would not exist were it not for the fact that Kyiv took the route of armed suppression of the mood of protest that emerged in the country after the Government was overthrown with direct support from external forces. Ukrainian forces have been shelling residential areas of Donetsk and Luhansk for two years now, killing peaceful civilians, including women and children.  As far as the attitude of the Ukrainian authorities to women is concerned, I will simply cite a few facts from a recent report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. On 19 January 2015, some men in masks and camouflage arrested a woman in her home. For more than a week, they kept her in a basement in a Ukrainian Security Service building, where they beat and tortured her with electric shocks and burning plastic. They threatened to rape her daughter if she refused to confess. In another case, in June 2015, 10 armed men in masks and black uniforms arrested another woman. They put her in the basement of an unfinished building where they beat her head and body with their fists and a metal tube while threatening to rape and kill her. As of August, the woman was still in detention. Those are just two of the many examples that members can read about in the report. I would like to add that the conflict in eastern Ukraine would have been resolved long ago had the Kyiv authorities not time and again tried to rewrite or tinker with the Minsk agreement reached a year and a half ago. There was a reference to Nadiya Savchenko in the statement by the representative of Ukraine. She returned to Russia, where she stated that Kyiv should apologize to the inhabitants of Donetsk and Luhansk. It is a pity that the Government has neither the humanity nor the political will to do so.  I now resume my functions as President of the Council.  I wish to remind all speakers to limit their statements to no more than four minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber. 1 would like to appeal to speakers to deliver their statements at a normal speed so that interpretation can be provided accurately.  I should like to inform participants that, given the long list of speakers, we will continue with this meeting through the lunch hour, and perhaps into the evening. Speakers who wish to make a second intervention will be able to do so once all those on the list of speakers has been exhausted.  I now give the floor to the representative of Sweden.

At the same time, of course, we should remember that there is no more reliable way to protect humankind, including women and children, from the horrors ofwar than resolving crisis situations as quickly as possible.  In conclusion, I am compelled to make one more observation. Not for the first time, today the representative of Ukraine strayed a long way beyond the confines of our discussion to touch on the general topic of the conflict in eastern Ukraine. That would not exist were it not for the fact that Kyiv took the route of armed suppression of the mood of protest that emerged in the country after the Government was overthrown with direct support from external forces. Ukrainian forces have been shelling residential areas of Donetsk and Luhansk for two years now, killing peaceful civilians, including women and children.  As far as the attitude of the Ukrainian authorities to women is concerned, I will simply cite a few facts from a recent report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. On 19 January 2015, some men in masks and camouflage arrested a woman in her home. For more than a week, they kept her in a basement in a Ukrainian Security Service building, where they beat and tortured her with electric shocks and burning plastic. They threatened to rape her daughter if she refused to confess. In another case, in June 2015, 10 armed men in masks and black uniforms arrested another woman. They put her in the basement of an unfinished building where they beat her head and body with their fists and a metal tube while threatening to rape and kill her. As of August, the woman was still in detention. Those are just two of the many examples that members can read about in the report. I would like to add that the conflict in eastern Ukraine would have been resolved long ago had the Kyiv authorities not time and again tried to rewrite or tinker with the Minsk agreement reached a year and a half ago. There was a reference to Nadiya Savchenko in the statement by the representative of Ukraine. She returned to Russia, where she stated that Kyiv should apologize to the inhabitants of Donetsk and Luhansk. It is a pity that the Government has neither the humanity nor the political will to do so.  I now resume my functions as President of the Council.  I wish to remind all speakers to limit their statements to no more than four minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the Chamber. 1 would like to appeal to speakers to deliver their statements at a normal speed so that interpretation can be provided accurately.  I should like to inform participants that, given the long list of speakers, we will continue with this meeting through the lunch hour, and perhaps into the evening. Speakers who wish to make a second intervention will be able to do so once all those on the list of speakers has been exhausted.  I now give the floor to the representative of Sweden.  "

Mr. Mendoza-Garcia (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish) Costa Rica congratulates the Council presidency for convening today's debate to analyse the progress in the implementation of the women and peace and security agenda a year after the fifteenth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000). That resolution represented a major change in the inclusion of women in the context of peace and security, promoting their direct involvement and their active and meaningful participation in addressing the disproportionate impact of conflict and violence on women. In that way, they are recognized not as victims but as agents of change, where empowered women, on an equal footing with their male counterparts, are the basis of peaceful and inclusive societies. We welcome the briefing by the Executive Director of UN-Women and the Secretary-General's statement.  Although the positive effect that women generate in negotiations in peace, conflict resolution, post-conflict and humanitarian assistance processes has been recognized, there is still resistance to the adequate and meaningful integration of women in those processes. That resistance lies partly in the high cost of political will and partly in structural obstacles, as evidenced in the large gap that persists in the presence of women in leadership positions in entities dedicated to peace and security activities. For example, during 2015, fewer than 10 per cent of the management positions in peace and security activities at the United Nations were held by women.  Gender balance in senior-level management is desirable and necessary. Only 22 per cent of the Under- Secretaries-General today are women. It is clear therefore that previous commitments to gender parity have failed the compliance test. We therefore call on the permanent and elected members of the Security Council to support without restrictions the commitment made by the Secretary-General-elect to achieve gender parity at all levels of appointment at the United Nations, for which he will present and implement a road map with clear benchmarks and deadlines, starting with the selection of senior staff.  Integrating the women and peace and security agenda throughout the work of the Security Council should be a priority. It is noteworthy that, in response to the recommendations outlined in resolution 2242 (2015), several initiatives have been launched, for example, the Informal Expert Group on Women and Peace and Security. They have not ignored the need to fight terrorism in order thereby to improve the implementation of the women and peace and security agenda in every context.  Similarly, we consider it valuable to have gender perspectives in various areas of action within peace and security processes, such as in commissions of inquiry, mediation processes and mechanisms of transitional justice. Building partnerships with such organizations as UN-Women, so as to benefit from their experience and views on those various efforts, is another way to integrate a gender perspective into all aspects of the peace and security agenda. Let us welcome also the systematic inclusion of women-protection advisers in the strategic planning processes for political missions and peacekeeping operations, the training of teams of experts on the rule of law and sexual violence in conflict, as well as working with associations supported by UN-Women, such as Justice Rapid Response, which has facilitated the recruitment and inclusion of female gender advisers in commissions of inquiry on cases relating to sexual violence and abuse crimes.  The incidence and widespread use of sexual violence as a tactic of terror and a weapon of war are heartbreaking. We urge that such acts be sanctioned with firm penalties and that impunity be completely eliminated, including, when necessary, through referral of cases to the International Criminal Court. We consider such acts of violence to constitute crimes against humanity, and we maintain a position of zero tolerance when it comes to cases of sexual violence and abuse.  The fundamental point remains to get women into leadership positions, where they can be involved in decisions and provide a gender perspective at all levels of participation and in all activities related to the peace and security agenda. That should also be linked with efforts to protect human rights and development. We must not forget that resolution 1325 (2000) was conceived as a human rights mandate.  Ensuring equal opportunities and the economic, social and political empowerment of women is an imperative, if women and girls are to assume, with all the tools they need, the desired transcendental and transformative role in their communities during and following conflicts.

In demonstration of the pain we share with all the victims of terrorism and our firm rejection of these cowardly terrorist attacks, I would now ask Council members to rise and observe a minute of silence.  The members of the Council observed a minute ofsilence.  Adoption of the agenda The agenda was adopted.  Maintenance of international peace and security Trafficking in persons in conflict situations  Report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of measures to counter trafficking in persons (S/2016/949)  Letter dated 2 December 2016 from the Permanent Representative of Spain to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General (S/2016/103l)  The President (spoke in Spanish): I wish to warmly welcome the Secretary-General, Ministers and other distinguished representatives present in the Security Council Chamber.

The draft  resolution has been adopted unanimously as resolution 2331 (2016).  I shall now make a statement in my national capacity as President of the Government of Spain.  I wish to begin my statement by warmly thanking the following for their presence participation in today's debate: Secretary-General Ban-Ki-moon; Mr. Yury Fedotov, Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime; Ms. Zainab Hava Bangura, Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict; Ms. Ameena Saeed Hasan; and Ms. Nadia Murad Basee Taha.  This meeting is particularly important for Spain not only because of the topic's relevance but also because it is the last debate that my country shall convene as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. Moreover, human trafficking is a clear affront to human dignity and also represents a threat to international peace and security in conflict and terrorism-related situations. It is a reincarnation of slavery in the midst of the twenty-first century. Leaders from throughout the world and representatives of civil society have underscored the moral imperative of combating human trafficking and all modern forms of slavery. The victims, the majority of whom are women and children, require - as was stated here - an urgent response, in particular by the Security Council.  My delegation proposes a paradigm shift recognizing that national judicial systems can break down in conflict situations. Under those circumstances, action by the Security Council becomes necessary. It is on that basis that we proposed resolution 2331 (2016), the first resolution in the history of the Security Council on this tragic phenomenon.  With this open debate, we are beginning to engage in what will be a deep reflection upon what contributions the Council can make to condemn human trafficking in areas of conflicts and the situations of exploitation to which that trafficking leads. We also propose exploring means of strengthening the normative framework in the area of sanctions, financial flows, victim protection and assistance and developing a more effective strategy in the fight against human trafficking in areas of conflict. The response of the United Nations to the scourge of human trafficking continues to be fragmented. Eradicating this scourge requires more than just the efforts of a single region, country, or department or agency of the United Nations. It requires efforts from all parties concerned, including the Council.  Unfortunately, the connection between conflict and human trafficking is not a new one. The novel element is the use ofhuman trafficking as a tactic in terrorism in the economy of war by groups like Da'esh, Al-Shabaab and Boko Haram. We have just heard the shocking account of a brave survivor, Ms. Nadia Murad Basee Taha, who is now a strong defender of the rights of the Yazidi people in Iraq and the winner of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. We have also heard from someone who risked her life to rescue many of those victims, Ms. Ameena Saeed Hasan. Both ofthem, along with Special Representative of the Secretary- General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Ms. Zainab Hawa Bangura, have explained how Da'esh is openly promoting the trafficking and enslavement of women and children, thereby defying the most elemental norms of international law.  However, trafficking in situations of conflict is not limited to the context of terrorism. The conflicts in Iraq, Syria, Libya and the Sahel - just to mention a few - are leading to the mass displacement of particularly vulnerable groups. That renders them even more vulnerable to exploitation and trafficking networks. Like many other countries, at the end of 2015, Spain adopted a new comprehensive plan to fight human trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. Also in 2015, my Government strengthened coordination between civil society organizations and our State security agencies. We have worked to develop a counternarrative to extremism as part of our national strategy to fight violent extremism. My country has put in place a communication strategy on cyberspace that includes a counternarrative to radicalization. In that regard, it is essential to monitor social networks in order to prevent extremism and gain knowledge of any radical content that could lead to trafficking.  The next five years afford us a historic opportunity for us to place the fight against the worst forms of exploitation at the top of the list of United Nations priorities. While important progress has been made in certain areas, much remains to be done. In that regard, I would like to thank the Secretary-General for his efforts in combating sexual exploitation and abuse and his zero-tolerance policy regarding sexual violence, which in some cases is perpetrated by Blue Helmets. I would like to conclude by stating that my country will resolutely support all efforts to ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice and that they serve their sentences. Let us strengthen our efforts to achieve that goal. That is what I ask of everyone today.  I now resume my functions as President of the Council.  I shall now give the floor to the other members of the Council.   ",The President,,Spanish,u," I thank Ms. Taha for her very meaningful briefing.

UNSC_2017_SPV.7898_spch029.txt,2017,7898,"The President: I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of the United Kingdom.  I should like to begin by thanking all four of our excellent briefers and by paying particular tribute to our civil society briefer, Ilwad Elman, for bringing home to us the devastating impact of trafficking and slavery in conflict. She gave voice to the 46 million men, women and children caught up in that tragedy across the world. I am glad that so many ministers are here today to hear that testimony, and I am grateful to them and to all Council members for their statements.  The fullest response of each and every Member of the United Nations is needed, and I look forward to hearing the views of countries outside the Security Council shortly because, as we have heard so clearly, modern slavery is a global problem that extends far beyond the 15 countries represented at this table. It exists in nearly all societies, including my own. It does not respect borders or jurisdictions. It does not recognize the dignity or worth of the human person. It just sees opportunities to exploit and lives to destroy.  Ifwe could hear the millions who are being coerced and exploited today, their unwavering message to us would be that we have simply not done enough and that we have shut our eyes and dulled our senses to a crime we hoped had been consigned to history. That is why the United Kingdom called this open debate. It is why my Prime Minister, Theresa May, first raised this issue before the General Assembly last year (see A/71/PV.8) and plans to do so again later this year. It is also why we are taking such strong action in our own country and across the world so that, together, we can eradicate it.  We know the root causes. Poverty, conflict and instability lie at the heart of the suffering of so many victims. When a State's authorities is eroded and its responsibility to its people is unfulfilled, organized criminal networks thrive, partnering with armed groupds and terrorists to prey on the vulnerable - to prey on those who have already suffered far too much. We know what follows: sexual exploitation and sexual slavery, forced labour and child labour, human rights in tatters, conflict exploited and conflict sustained.  This should be a familiar tale to the Council. We heard it ourselves in north-eastern Nigeria only last week. We saw it in the hands in the air when we asked the women there whether they had lost a child to Boko Haram. We saw it in their tears as they spoke of abducted daughters, of mass rapes, of grandchildren being born only to be enslaved. In response, we need a more forceful and unified United Nations approach to human trafficking, modern slavery and forced labour. We look forward to the Secretary-General's report in November on exactly that, and we encourage him to focus on making existing structures, including the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking in Persons, work effectively.  We also need to combine our efforts across the mandates entrusted to us. We in the Council have a responsibility - no, a duty - to maintain international peace and security, to end the instability in which modern slavery thrives. As United Nations Members, we have frameworks for action, including the commitment under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to ending trafficking, modern slavery and forced labour, and the General Assembly's Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons.  But we also need to take responsibility as individual Member States. That means doing more to disrupt and disband serious organized criminal networks engaged in people trafficking. It means all of us ratifying the 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery, and the Protocol to the International Labour Organization Convention Concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour. And it means taking real steps to strengthen our own national systems to identify, investigate and prosecute those committing these abhorrent crimes.  If we take these steps, at home and here in the United Nations, we will have begun to turn the page. But ifwe are to truly consign this terrible tragedy to the history books, we will need sustained commitment that endures long after this meeting is over. Modern slavery must become a recurring theme for the Council and other parts of the United Nations to return to, including at this year's session of the General Assembly, so that we can accelerate our efforts to end this abhorrent practice once and for all.  I resume my functions as President of the Council.

UNSC_2017_SPV.7938_spch007.txt,2017,7938,"The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank Ms. Jaf for her briefing.  I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay.  It is an honour for me to preside over this debate, and it is the wish of Uruguay to express its thanks to everyone who has come here today to address a theme that requires our constant attention and which is an essential part of the agenda on women and peace and security. This is an agenda to which we adhere, and we endorse the statement to be delivered by Canada on behalf of the Group of Friends of Women and Peace and Security.  Uruguay decided to convene this open debate in the conviction that sexual violence constitutes one of the worst attacks against human dignity. In the framework of international human rights law, sexual violence is also a direct attack on dignity. It is an attack on the right to freedom and honour and, of course, an attack on the right to life. We should recall that, under the definition in the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, sexual violence carried out by the State itself is to be considered as torture.  On the basis of resolution 1325 (2000) and other resolutions and complementary documents, we have strengthened the normative framework so as to address that problem. Despite all those efforts, however, it is a matter of concern to read the contents of the latest report of the Secretary-General (S/2017/249) indicating the ongoing nature of sexual violence, which is used by terrorist groups, violent extremists, non-State armed groups and also by some State actors.  Sexual violence used systematically becomes a tactic of war and an act of terrorism, manifesting itself through abhorrent practices, which include rape, sexual slavery, prostitution, forced marriage, as well as pregnancies, abortions and forced sterilization. In the context of a conflict situation, we know that the systematic, organized and even planned use of sexual violence, directed especially against the most vulnerable groups of the civilian population, constitutes barbaric tools, which have been developed by terrorist groups such as Da'esh, Boko Haram, Al-Nusra and Al-Shabaab. Sexual violence as a tactic of war and terrorism thus becomes a lethal weapon ofwar. It causes physical harm but, even worse, it attacks what is most valuable to human beings: their dignity. It destroys and dehumanizes women, girls, boys and men.  Victims who have suffered the effects of sudden sexual violence require, where possible, a long and costly recuperation, which has a direct impact on the social fabric, economic development, family life and on everything that depends on civil society for its development. The long-term costs of the use of sexual violence in conflicts are much deeper and more complex than they may at first appear. Once again, we in the Organization find ourselves confirming the fact that prevention and early warning is where we must focus our efforts to prevent the occurrence of such undesirable acts and all of their costly ramifications.  For those reasons, given the gravity and complexity of the problem, the international community must produce swift, coordinated and comprehensive responses. Uruguay supports the suggestions contained in the report of the Secretary-General on conflict- related sexual violence and considers them appropriate.  First, empowering women is essential. The common denominator of sexual violence is that it finds fertile ground where there are pre-existing patterns of structural discrimination based on gender. Women must therefore have access to education and employment and must participate in decision-making processes in order to reaffirm their integrity and value as human beings.  We reiterate that there must be increased participation by women in the areas of mediation, prevention and conflict resolution, as highlighted in resolution 1325 (2000). Their capacity for rapprochement, negotiation, understanding and empathy in such situations is more than proven. Uruguay firmly believes that. The increase in the number of women in peacekeeping operations in which Uruguay participates has enriched the quality of the contingents. In missions such as the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we can attest to the effective role of women in creating confidence in local communities, for reasons already mentioned, and, furthermore, in individuals who have been victims of sexual violence.  Secondly, as mentioned at the beginning, attention must be paid to the recovery and reintegration ofvictims. Victims require a minimum support that involves medical and psychosocial care, including sexual and reproductive health care. Although at the beginning I mentioned that the main victims of sexual violence are women, girls, boys and adolescents, men too are victims. Civil society as a whole is a group vulnerable to the aberrant practice. Rape, enforced sterilization, the transmission of AIDS, genital violence and castration are all forms of sexual violence that are used as weapons of war and terrorism. The humiliation and social rejection suffered by victims is a responsibility that Governments, civil society organizations and community and religious leaders must bear in mind and attend to with all the appropriate means in order to be able to effectively mend the social fabric.  Similarly, girls and boys born of war and produced by sexual violence - by women being raped - are invisible victims, who from the time they are born are denied another fundamental human right: the right to a name. As mentioned today, in many cases girls and boys born of rape are considered to be children of the enemy and face a life of rejection and exclusion. They continue to be denied fundamental rights and to be deprived of access to basic services such as medical care and education. Nonetheless, those girls and boys are also members of society, and steps must be taken for their education, integration, inclusion and social acceptance so as to prevent a vicious circle that perpetuates violence.  Thirdly, we believe that these crimes must be condemned because accountablility is fundamental to ensuring that they do not go unpunished. They must not remain unpunished. We cannot forget that memory, truth, justice and the adoption of new legal, cultural and social changes, among others, are the links in the only chain than can guarantee that events that lead to conflict do not recur and that at the same time can restore dignity to the victims.  We States must increase our efforts to ensure that those who are guilty of such crimes are brought to justice, at both the domestic and international levels. In that regard, the International Criminal Court plays an essectial role in judging those crimes that have been recognized by the Rome Statute as war crimes, crimes against humanity or even crimes of genocide. In addition, let us recall that the use of sexual violence in conflicts is also considered to be a risk factor indicator in the Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes, a document issued in 2014 by the United Nations Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect. It is therefore up to the Security Council to ensure that crimes of sexual violence are referred to the International Criminal Court and that such cases continue to be monitored. The Security Council must also ensure that the theme ofsexual violence is addressed in all of the relevant sanctions committees and that the names of the alleged perpetrators of sexual violence are systematically included on their sanctions lists.  In the context of peacekeeping operations, we believe that addressing sexual violence in conflict is an essential part of protecting civilians and a fundamental aspect of the mandate of such operations. As such, all available means must be employed in furtherance of and in defence of such mandates.  Uruguay wishes to express its support for the work of the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, in particular its efforts to end impunity for such crimes. We deeply appreciate the positive impact of the roster of legal experts from UN-Women and Justice Rapid Response, who have worked with United Nations bodies and States to promote accountability in cases of sexual and gender-based violence.  It can be concluded that a fragmented approach is not an appropriate response to sexual violence used as a tactic of war and terrorism in conflict. The isolated efforts of one country or groups of countries, civil society or the organs and agencies of this Organization are not enough to eradicate it. Only concerted action will allow us to respond effectively to that terrible scourge.  I now resume my functions as President of the Council.  I give the floor to the Minister of Defence of Sweden.

UNSC_2017_SPV.8022_spch020.txt,2017,8022,"The President (spoke in Arabic): I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of Egypt.  At the outset, I would like to thank the Deputy Secretary-General, Ms. Amina Mohammed, for her very comprehensive briefing on her recent visit to Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  I would also like to thank the Permanent Observer of the African Union to the United Nations, Mr. Te'te Antonio, for his briefing.  I also take this opportunity to laud the cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union in efforts to address conflict-related sexual violence. This is an example ofa partnership between the United Nations and a regional organization that should be used as a model to address sexual violence in conflict.  I should now like to highlight the following points.  First, Egypt welcomes the measures taken by the United Nations to address sexual violence in armed conflict, including the increase in the number of women protection advisers on the ground, support to strengthen national institution capacity and the launch of the United Nations Action against Sexual Violence. Egypt also commends the efforts undertaken by the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict and in particular the support it gave to strengthen the capacity of States during armed conflict and post-conflict, in areas such as conducting inquiries and investigations, judicial prosecutions and criminal trials, dispensing military justice, legislative reforms, the protection of witnesses and reparations.  Secondly, Egypt underscores its unwavering commitment to the United Nations zero-tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse, championed by the Secretary-General. Egypt is committed to working with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, within the framework of the General Assembly, to end to all forms of violence against women. Incidences of such violence committed within peacekeeping operations must be investigated, in line with General Assembly resolution 71/297. We reiterate that it is important for Blue Helmets to be properly trained to handle incidences of sexual violence.  Egypt commends the efforts undertaken by Nigeria to put an end to the sexual violence committed by the terrorist group Boko Haram, in north- eastern Nigeria. Those efforts include rehabilitation and support programmes for victims, programmes for the reintegration of women and girls into their local communities, and for the provision of legal, judicial and medical services to women who are victims of sexual violence.  In that regard, the fight against sexual violence requires synergy and strengthened cooperation between Nigeria and its neighbouring countries. Moreover, the international community, for its part, must continue to lend assistance to Nigeria so that the country can address the challenges linked to cases of sexual violence. In that regard, I would like to underscore that international efforts must be aligned in order to strengthen the capacity of community and religious leaders to raise the awareness of local communities about the importance of putting an end to stereotypes and the stigmatization that affect victims of sexual violence and their children. That stigmatization should be borne by the perpetrators of these crimes and not the victims. We must also prevent terrorism and extremism and win the intellectual war, including the fight against attempts by extremists to make rape permissible in religious terms. In that regard, we would like to welcome the role of Al-Azhar in the fight against erroneous fatwas issued by terrorist organizations pertaining to the situation of women in conflict.  Egypt welcomes the progress that has been made by the authorities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to put an end to sexual violence in conflict. We acknowledge the measures taken in that vein, including the establishment of the post of a special adviser to the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on tackling sexual violence and the recruitment of child soldiers. We also welcome the efforts to implement the relevant national strategy, including the appointment of women judges and their deployment in the various regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. There have been a variety of measures aimed at ensuring that victims have access to justice and also that they receive adequate and appropriate care.  On another note, recent violence has worsened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in particular in Kasai and other regions. There have been many victims of this worsening violence, including the two United Nations experts of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who lost their lives. As a result, the civilian population is faced with growing challenges, including the risk of sexual violence in conflict. This is a risk mostly faced by women and girls. In that respect, I highlight the reports on rapes perpetrated by militia against boys and girls in Kavumu in southern Kivu. Such reports underscore the importance of ramping up our efforts to ensure the implementation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo national strategy to combat sexual violence, with the support of the United Nations, and with a key role to be played by the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We call on all partners to make their contribution to heed the humanitarian appeal of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to make available the necessary resources to United Nations agencies and to civil society as they seek to provide humanitarian aid, including to victims of sexual violence.

UNSC_2017_SPV.8079_spch025.txt,2017,8079,"The President (spoke in French): I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of France.  Iwarmly thank the Chef de Cabinet of the Secretary- General, Ms. Ribeiro Viotti; the Executive Director of UN-Women, Ms. Mlambo-Ngcuka; Ms. Mina- Rojas; and the Secretary General of the International Organization of La Francophonie, Ms. Michaelle Jean, for their very enlightening briefings.  I would like to pay particular tribute to the vital role played by civil society in promoting and implementing this very important agenda, on whose behalf Ms. Mina- Rojas delivered a strong and committed message today. I take this opportunity to reiterate France's support for the initiatives of organizations that campaign for respecting and promoting women's rights in the field. Those initiatives must not be hindered, but instead robustly supported and encouraged.  I also welcome the presence and commitment ofthe Secretary General of the International Organization of La Francophonie, Ms. Michaelle Jean, to this agenda. The efforts of the countries of La Francophonie indeed symbolize a strong and important message. I would like to say another word of support, together with Germany, for the determination of the African Union and Ghana to establish a network of African women leaders. We also welcome Italy's initiative to build a network of women mediators in the Mediterranean, which was launched yesterday in Rome.  1 turn first to the issue of our collective commitment with regard to the practical implementation of this agenda and the participation of women, before briefly presenting the efforts undertaken by France on a daily basis to that end.  We simply cannot resolve crises without ensuring the protection and participation of women. Women must be protected 4 that is essential - but they must also be fully involved in conflict prevention and resolution. That must be a genuine common priority not only in our words but also in our actions to ensure both equality and efficiency. The participation of women in political processes and in conflict prevention and resolution remains grossly inadequate: from 1992 to 2011, 4 per cent of peace agreement signatories and fewer than 10 per cent of negotiators participating in peace talks were women. The report of the Secretary-General on women and peace and security (S/2017/86l) refers clearly to this state of affairs and underscores the fact that some areas, such as disarmament, are still closed off to women. That shows just how much we must change the breadth of the implementation of the women and peace and security agenda. We must move from words to actions. We are not talking about a peripheral issue; we are talking about a pivotal matter that should lie at the heart of the daily work of the United Nations.  The Security Council has adopted eight ambitious resolutions on this subject; however, it is quite clear that their implementation remains woefully insufficient. Progress has certainly been noted, particularly within the Council: three-quarters of resolutions take the women and peace and security agenda into account and an informal group of experts has been set up. A network of national focal points has also been established. But now Governments must embrace their responsibility and develop national, and even regional, plans and implement them. In short, it is time to take practical action.  It is also necessary to set aside space to implement a global, frequent and responsible evaluation of the initiatives we carry out. We need to step up our analysis conflicts against the backdrop of gender, including through an exchange of best practices. Measuring progress will also be important, as it will present a challenge for years to come. We are well aware of the fact that - and this has been said, but it bears repeating - when women participate in peace processes, the lasting success ofpeace agreements over a period of at least two years increases by 20 per cent, and the likelihood of an agreement remaining in place for at least 15 years increases by 25 per cent. Once again, therefore, that is an obligation that is not just a matter of equality but of efficiency. The United Nations itself must be exemplary in that regard, and we welcome the establishment by the Secretary-General of a pool of female talent for access to leadership positions.  France is committed to staying at the forefront of the international community's efforts to implement the women and peace and security agenda. I would now like to briefly present our national action plan for the implementation of this agenda. First, however, allow me to recall the fact that our parity law has undeniably enabled France to achieve decisive progress in women't representation in the political life of my country. The French Government has achieved parity, as has the Permanent Mission of France to the United Nations here in New York.  More specifically, France is implementing its second national action plan on women and peace and security, which covers the period 2015-2018. It is built on five pillars: participation; protection, which during conflict means primarily protection against violence, but also more broadly protection for the rights of women; the fight against impunity; prevention, especially through raising awareness of violence against women; and promoting the women and peace and security agenda. For each of those pillars we are implementing initiatives at the national, multilateral and concrete cooperation levels. Allow me to briefly mention a few examples.  First of all, France is taking action against impunity when crimes are committed against women, including to enable women's access to justice. To that end, we fully support the Secretary-General's zero- tolerance policy against sexual exploitation and abuse. In the same spirit, the President of the French Republic, Mr. Emmanuel Macron, joined the circle of leaders at the high-level segment of the General Assembly. Along the same lines, the Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs, Mr. Jean-Yves Le Drian, signed the pact between the United Nations and Member States. In that regard, we commend the recent appointment by the Secretary-General of an advocate for the rights of victims of sexual exploitation and abuse.  Our efforts are also ongoing daily on the ground. For instance, we continue to support humanitarian programmes aimed at assisting women affected by the consequences of the crises in Afghanistan; the Central African Republic; Lebanon, as a result of the Syrian crisis; and Nigeria. We are also undertaking numerous projects to protect women from human trafficking, as a priority.  We must also more implement more coherently the women and peace and security agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. Our official development assistance already has fully incorporated the gender dimension, and the number of projects with a direct impact on the lives of women is rising as well. France has also undertaken a comprehensive effort and set specific goals to increase women's participation in its armed forces. Appointments have risen significantly, and women's representation has virtually doubled since 1998 to 15 per cent of overall troops today, which, of course, is not fully sufficient, but progress continues to be made. The armed forces, including peacekeeping- operation contingents, must also be made more aware of gender issues, and to that end gender advisers' functions, as has been mentioned, must be sustained within these operations.  Lastly, our national action plan dovetails closely with the European Union's efforts, and here I am thinking in particular of initiatives to address the situation of women in Afghanistan and Syria and of the recent joint initiative between the United Nations and the European Union, known as the Spotlight Initiative, which will make possible specific responses to violence against women.  France can be counted on to continue to do everything in its power to advance this agenda, which is at the very heart of the activities and values of the United Nations. Our vision is that of living in a world in which women are no longer victims of violence but can take their rightful place in conflict settlement and in the political, economic and social life of their countries. This is an imperative for equality and effectiveness. Women are the key to lasting peace and security.  I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.  The representative of Ukraine has asked for the floor to make a further statement.  ",The President,,French,u," I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of France.

I welcome the important briefings of the Deputy Secretary-General, Ms. Amina Mohammed, and Ms. Pramila Patten, as well as the valuable testimony of Ms. Razia Sultana. We also welcome the participation of a significant number of countries that have requested to take part in this open debate.  My delegation is especially grateful for the support and contribution of women's organizations in preparing for this annual debate and for the Informal Expert group on Women and Peace and Security, which Peru has the honour to chair alongside Sweden.  We wish to express Peru's commitment to the women and peace and security agenda, which is a crucial component of the fight against sexual violence in conflicts. We are convinced that the United Nations, particularly the Security Council, has a fundamental role to play in preventing this atrocious crime.  We note with deep concern the magnitude of the problem and the changing patterns of sexual violence noted in the Secretary-General's latest report (S/2018/250). Its widespread and systematic use as a military tactic and attack against collective identities must be acknowledged and confronted as a threat to peace and international security. Consequently, we must condemn in the strongest terms all forms of sexual violence in armed conflicts, which overwhelmingly affects women, girls and boys. We must protect the victims and ensure that those responsible are held accountable. But that is not enough. A comprehensive strategy against this scourge requires addressing its root causes. To that end, the empowerment of women, gender equality and access to justice are key.  Evidence illustrates that greater participation by women in decision-making processes results in a lower likelihood of conflict, and that defending and promoting their rights reduces their vulnerability. Equality and empowerment have a direct impact on the maintenance of peace and security. The same applies to access to justice. We reaffirm the critical need to ensure that those responsible for such acts of violence are held accountable before the justice system and to eliminate all structural obstacles that hamper investigation and prosecution of rape and other forms of sexual violence. Moreover, due attention to and the rehabilitation of the victims are critical to any process of building sustainable peace. It is necessary to understand that their traumas are also psychological in nature and carry the potential to destroy the social fabric of a community.  We cannot ignore the stigma and fear of the victims, or their intimidation by their attackers. The majority of cases of sexual violence are not reported. This reflects the low level of confidence in and credibility of national institutions, which is exacerbated when the aggressors are members of the security forces. It is necessary to create a closer relationship between the State and its institutions and the victims. In this regard, Peru has a national plan on violence against women and a comprehensive reparations programme for the victims of violence in Peru between 1980 and 2000.  The Peruvian commitment to the women and peace and security agenda is also manifested in the progressive increase in Peruvian women's participation as Blue Helmets, pursuant to resolution 1820 (2008). In this regard, we wish to highlight the importance of incorporating the gender perspective into the mandates of peacekeeping operations deployed by the Council. There is also the need to adequately train Blue Helmets to protect women and children's human rights. The Security Council must also continue to encourage, support and monitor specific commitments and plans to prevent sexual violence in the conflicts on its agenda. We consider it important to recall, in line with resolution 1820 (2008), that sexual crimes should not be subject to amnesty in the context of conflict resolution processes.  We wish to conclude by expressing our appreciation of and support for the work of the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict and her team, and to highlight the high priority given to this issue by the Secretary-General, in keeping with the need to build sustainable peace. In the words of the Secretary- General, the time has come ""to give that agenda the investment and action it deserves, so as to replace horror with hope"" (S/2018/250, para. 22).

UNSC_2018_SPV.8306_spch005.txt,2018,8306,"The President: I thank Ms. Diop for her briefing.  I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden.  Yesterday morning, the Deputy Secretary-General; the African Union Special Envoy on Women, Peace and Security; and I arrived in New York from Niger. It was my privilege to join Amina and Bineta on that joint high-level mission focused on women, peace and security in the Sahel. It is also now my pleasure to welcome my travel companions to today's meeting. As they have done already, I would like to thank the Governments of the Niger and Chad for their generous hospitality, and the inspiring women and men we met during our mission for sharing their stories with us.  I would like to make three points following our mission: first, on the overall challenges in the region, secondly, how we must address the interrelated nature of these challenges, and thirdly, that all this is not a women's issue - it is a peace and security issue.  The countries we visited and the Sahel region are located between hope and despair. There is hope, because the Sahel is blessed with abundant human, cultural and natural resources - for example, solar energy, which offers tremendous capital for rapid growth. It is also the most youthful region of the world, with 64.5 per cent of the population aged less than 25 years.  Hope was inspired also by the women and girls we met, who had moved from being victims to survivors to agents of change; by youth, who look to their futures with confidence despite their difficult circumstances; and by  the vibrant and determined civil society organizations working to improve the lives of men, women, girls and boys across the region. We also heard from the Governments of Chad and the Niger about their efforts, undertaken together with other countries in the region, to promote regional stability and combat terrorism, including through the Multinational Joint Task Force and the Group of Five for the Sahel Joint Force.  However, there is also despair because of chronic underdevelopment, terrorism and violent extremism, a lack of respect for human rights and the negative effects of climate change. There are 24 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, and the growing insecurity has worsened vulnerabilities. Today, the national budgets are used to finance security concerns, as we already heard, with less money available for education and health. Those challenges affect women and men, boys and girls differently. Women often bear a disproportionate burden.  In the Lake Chad region, where people are already facing a food and nutrition crisis, we heard how the shrinking of the Lake and growing insecurity have had severe consequences for people who traditionally have sustained themselves by fishing activities. However, now, women are learning to fish. They said that before the fish were this big and men did the fishing; now the fish are this small and we can fish. The fisherwomen we met in Bol told us that they wished for only three things: bigger boats, better nets and to not get raped. That simple request illustrates the conditions under which they live, marked by poverty and sexual and gender-based violence.  In both Chad and the Niger, we met with civil society representatives who described challenges such as a lack of female candidates for public offices, inadequate health care and difficulties in ensuring education for girls. In the Niger, we heard that three out of four girls will be married before turning 18, with devastating consequences, as Ms. Diop has already said. We met with women religious leaders and discussed efforts to prevent radicalization and to end the practice of child marriages. We were encouraged to see that in both countries, women were coming together in networks to address the challenges they face, including sexual and reproductive health and rights and access to basic social services.  Secondly, this joint mission encompassed all aspects of the United Nations work - peace and security, human rights, humanitarian assistance and development. It was once again clear to me, during our mission, how those areas of work overlap. The many challenges in the Sahel cannot be dealt with separately, but rather require joint political strategies and integrated responses.  The United Nations Integrated Strategy for the Sahel and its support plan are key tools at our disposal to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and the African Union's Agenda 2063. Gender equality and women's empowerment is one of the Strategy's five key priorities. We must spare no effort in ensuring implementation. We need to expand the choices and opportunities available to women from an early age. That means ensuring education for girls, addressing restrictive traditional and related social norms, and fighting poverty. It means going back to basics, starting where we can make a difference.  Yet, the resources needed to fully address the challenges in the region are woefully inadequate. We need to step up our efforts to mobilize support and strengthen national capacities to respond to inequalities, fight impunity, create sustainable livelihoods and empower and educate women and girls. Aid must be gender-sensitive and take into account the various situations in which women and men find themselves, as well as promoting equality.  Thirdly, our visit also underscored that all of this taken together is not solely a women's issue - it is a peace and security issue. In the Lac region of Chad we were deeply moved by Halima, who had been married off as a 15-year-old child and then trained by Boko Haram to be a suicide bomber. She lost both her legs when the suicide vests of some of the girls who had been trained with her exploded as they entered a busy market. Today Halima is a paralegal and is actively engaged in the prevention of violent extremism, as well as being a powerful symbol of the many roles of women in peace and security.  The increased use of female suicide bombers - two thirds of suicide attacks in 2017 were carried out by women or girls - illustrates the cruel way in which terrorists seek to exploit the perceived goodness of women to maximize harm, to the victims of suicide bombings and to communities and families. That is disastrous given women's role as pillars of families, societies and communities. Societies could collapse, but nonetheless women continue to fight. We must empower and educate girls and women and end child marriage. To fight terrorism, there is no doubt, we need adopt a gender-sensitive and human rights-based approach, whether it pertains to the prevention of radicalization, counter-terrorism operations or providing support to victims.  Let me end by answering the question of why this is a matter for those around this table, a matter for the Security Council. It is because women's destiny is also our destiny. Therefore, what can and must we do? In two years resolution 1325 (2000) will be 20 years old. I would like to put the following challenge to the United Nations system and all Member States: by 2020 ensure that United Nations peacekeeping and political missions fully deliver on the women and peace and security agenda. The Security Council has a critical role to play, including by ensuring that women's voices are heard around peace negotiation tables and in the Chamber; mission mandates include a women and peace and security perspective; gender posts in missions continue to be funded; women and peace and security tasks are adequately resourced and prioritized; and that gender is systematically included in mission reporting and monitoring.  We must all set the same challenge for ourselves. Members can count on Sweden to do its part to support that effort. To start, we will continue to ensure that civil society perspectives are heard in the Chamber. For the annual debate on resolution 1325 (2000), we commit to hosting a civil society forum. We also commit to supporting the Secretariat to build capacity for enhanced gender-responsive reporting. Only then will we gain a full understanding of the challenges and of the most effective responses.  Let us continue to intensify our efforts to support the countries of the Sahel on the issues we have discussed today. I commend the African Union and the United Nations for joining forces and deepening their partnership on the issue of women and peace and security. Missions such as the one undertaken last week should become annual events, and every Security Council meeting should consider the women and peace and security perspective as an essential part of our work to end conflicts. I have no doubt that, if we were to do so, our motto of ""more women, more peace"" would become a reality.  I now resume my functions as President of the Council.  I shall now give the floor to the other members of the Council who wish to make statements.  ",The President,,English,u," I thank Ms. Diop for her briefing.

UNSC_2018_SPV.8382_spch021.txt,2018,8382,"The President (spoke in Spanish): I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the representative of the Plurinational State of Bolivia.  I would like to thank Secretary-General Antonio Guterres not only for the report (S/2018/900) that he presented today but also for his commitment to the issue that has brought us here today and for his noteworthy efforts to ensure that our Organization as a whole sets an example in terms of ensuring the equitable representation of women. I should like also to thank the Executive Director of UN-Women, Ms. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, and the representative of Palestinian civil society, Ms. Randa Siniora Atallah, for their briefings.  History was written by men - men who have relegated women to a secondary status, devalued their role in society and engaged in inexcusable forms of violence against them. We are the victims of a patriarchal system, rooted in capitalism, that exacerbates inequalities and the economic, social and cultural oppression of women throughout the world. This is the fundamental problem. This is the system that social organizations, civil society, regional organizations and the international community as a whole must fight.  However, there is no doubt that it is States that bear the primary responsibility for promoting structural changes that grant women the place that historically has been denied them. It is only through gender equality and the empowerment of women that we will bring about more just, inclusive and peaceful societies.  Women face many forms ofviolence on a daily basis and in various situations, but none is more cruel or has such devastating consequences as the violence resulting from armed conflict - hence the importance of the historic resolution 1325 (2000), which recognizes this fact and underscores the fundamental link that exists between respect for gender equality and international peace and security. On the basis of that resolution and the seven resolutions adopted by the Council on the subject, the United Nations has undertaken many efforts and made significant progress in their implementation in order to effectively integrate a gender perspective in peace processes and promote the participation of women in them. Among those advances, we can mention the establishment of UN-Women, the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, the Informal Expert Group on Women and Peace and Security and others.  However, despite those efforts, the implementation of the women and peace and security agenda continues to pose important challenges, mainly in this last point: the inclusion of women in peace processes. There are four pillars that make up the normative framework created by the Security Council: prevention, participation, protection and recovery. Each is equally important and they complement each other to ensure the optimal implementation of the agenda. Today we would like to emphasize the importance of prevention and how to achieve the active participation of women in peace processes.  While there are similarities, each country has its own reality and different challenges. We have highlighted the Colombian peace process because of the mechanisms used to promote women's participation and incorporate a gender perspective in the Final Agreement for Ending the Conflict and Building a Stable and Lasting Peace; and because of the gender balance in the personnel of the United Nations Verification Mission in Colombia, which is not seen in other peace missions.  Another historic example of women who promote peace and reconciliation in my region are the heroic Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo. We also highlight progress made in parliamentary representation achieved in Somalia, the advances made in the Sahel region and Afghanistan, among others. Those are clear examples of the importance of women's political empowerment.  Other cases with many challenges include those faced by the countries of the Lake Chad basin and their fight against terrorism imposed by Boko Haram, the stigma faced by its victims, as Deputy Secretary- General Amina Mohammed reported after her visit to that region, after which she went to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where she stressed the need to encourage women's participation in the electoral process. Other places where women face even more humanitarian complications are Yemen, Palestine and the Central African Republic, among others.  Every year we meet to highlight the importance of implementing the women and peace and security agenda, ending sexual violence in conflict, ensuring accountability and calling for the inclusion of women in peace processes. But how do we do that? First, we need empowered, free women, who are masters of their decisions and bodies, and who are economically independent. That is how they will be true agents of change. How do we achieve that? This is where States must show leadership and promote structural changes to combat inequality, poverty and discrimination. They should focus, first and foremost, on women.  Bolivia was an unstable country. Between 2000 and 2003, social conflicts broke out against the privatization of water and in defence of national sovereignty over our hydrocarbon resource reserves. We needed a fundamental change. Therefore, one of the first measures of the current Government was to establish the Constituent Assembly, which was presided over by a woman indigenous leader. We drafted a new Constitution, which was adopted in 2009 and established the right of women and men to participate freely in the creation, exercise and control of political power, on equal footing and under equal conditions.  On that basis we focused on adopting measures to make progress in dismantling the patriarchal system and thereby breaking down structural barriers, mainly through the political and economic empowerment of women. We promoted women's participation in decision-making roles through the Electoral System Act, which establishes parity and alternation in the lists of male and female candidates for representative posts, making Bolivia the second country in the world with the highest representation of women in the Legislative Assembly. In Bolivia, women have a majority not only in Parliament, but also in the other elected bodies.  In the same vein, one of the most important measures for women's economic inclusion was the Community-based Agrarian Reform Renewal Act, which not only guarantees the participation of women in land restoration and distribution processes, but also prioritizes women's right to own land. Twelve years ago, only 10 per cent of women in Bolivia were owners ofland. Today, in 2018, 45 per cent of land ownership is in the hands of women.  Bolivia has experienced 12 years of fundamental change, and without the role of women as agents of change, that transformation would not have been achieved. Today we enjoy economic, political and social stability that we did not have before. That is why we would like to reiterate our commitment to the women and peace and security agenda.  We thank the Secretary-General for the recommendations he presented today in the run-up to the twentieth anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000). All States, together with the United Nations system and civil society, must work together in a coordinated fashion to achieve optimal implementation of this agenda.

We thank Bolivia for initiating this open debate and welcome the annual report of the Secretary-General (S/2018/900).  We are no closer to peace. Women's security and rights are still threatened, specifically targeted by violent extremists. Women refugees are exposed to violence. Women's rights defenders are increasingly vulnerable. Sexual violence is endemic. This year's Nobel Peace Prize laureates expose human suffering that tears people apart and undermines peace and show us how to respond. Let us.  It has become decidedly harder to ignore women in peace and security efforts. The Secretary-General's strong leadership is crucial, as evidenced by the United Nations system-wide gender parity strategy; the Informal Expert Group on Women and Peace and Security; the Women, Peace and Security National Focal Points Network; the Group of Friends of Women, Peace and Security; networks, including the Women's Military Network; and the increasing number of national action plans and strategies to implement them effectively.  We benefit greatly from the consistent work of civil society, including the NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security and organizations like the International Civil Society Action Network, the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, and the Global Network of Women Peacebuilders, local women's groups and others. In South Sudan, Yemen, Afghanistan, Colombia, Syria and Liberia, women have found ways to engage. Their efforts increasingly coincide with those of the United Nations and regional organizations, as innovative inclusion mechanisms evolve, including subcommissions, situation rooms, women's advisory boards, and the Women's Peace and Humanitarian Fund.  We would like to congratulate Ethiopia on its recently elected Madam President Sahle-Work Zewde. There is progress, but, as we approach the twentieth anniversary ofresolution 1325 (2000), we aspire to more. Women fill more leadership positions in the United Nations and elsewhere, but are still underrepresented at all levels of peacekeeping. We must connect the peace mediation tracks better and ensure that inclusion mechanisms complement, rather than replace, efforts to include women on the formal track. We must enhance conflict analysis with a gender perspective and support the gender mainstreaming of peace operations. Our support for United Nations reform, UN-Women, the Department of Political Affairs and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations is part of our response, as are the women mediator networks. Regional networks of women mediators are in New York now to explore opportunities for further cooperation. We must prepare the ground for inclusive processes even in initial peace talks and focus as much on women's inclusion and rights in the implementation of peace agreements as in the negotiation phase.  A gender adviser position should be established in all operational headquarters, while leaders bear the ultimate responsibility to deliver. The United Nations high-level seminar on gender and inclusive mediation processes builds leaders' competence and capacity. Men must champion this cause as eagerly as women. We founded the Nordic Centre for Gender in Military Operations to engage with military actors in their work related to women, peace and security.

UNSC_2019_SPV.8508_spch007.txt,2019,8508,"The President: I thank Ms. Merekaje for her briefing.  I shall now make a statement in my capacity as Federal Minister of Defence of Germany.  My thanks go once again to Secretary-General Guterres, Major General Kristin Lund and Ms. Merekaj e for their briefings.  The women and peace and security agenda is one of Germany's priorities during its membership of the Security Council and during our presidency this month. In this open debate, I should like to focus on women serving in United Nations peacekeeping missions.  In my five years as Defence Minister, I have met many female peacekeepers, in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, for example, and many other missions. I have always been impressed with their dedication and diligence. More importantly, it has been obvious that they are always broadening their mission's skill set. Women are not better peacekeepers than men, but they are different. And this diversity is a strength. Yet, almost 20 years after the adoption of the landmark resolution 1325 (2000), we are still far from the full, effective and meaningful participation of women in peace operations. I would like to present five ideas on how to change that.  First, in empowering women in all walks of life, visibility is key. We need role models to stir the imagination - successful female mentors who tell their stories to younger women and share their experience. Therefore, Germany will take the initiative to establish a global female peacekeepers network. We pledge substantial support to get it up and running and invite Member States to contribute ideas of their own.  Secondly, the network will support the Elsie initiative, which is central to increasing the percentage of women peacekeepers. We applaud Canada for this great initiative and intend to provide up to â‚¬2 million to the Elsie trust fund.  Thirdly, we must send more women into international peacekeeping missions. We need more women in our national forces. Germany is striving to increase the share of female soldiers in our armed forces more rapidly than before, but also, and that is crucial, the share of female soldiers in leading positions. As Minister, I understand that this effort requires a constant pull from the top, a fight against unconscious bias and real barriers, and constant evaluation. Transparency is key. That is why my Ministry created a staff element on equal opportunity, diversity management and inclusion. This has led, for example, to a benchmarking of the evaluation of male and female soldiers, to a mentoring programme for junior female officers and to a regular exchange on best practices. Once again, transparency is crucial.  Fourthly, Germany has already been looking at what keeps women fromjoining our forces and advancing in them to top positions. We are seeking to intensify our analysis by initiating a national barrier assessment. We will determine what keeps more women from joining peace operations. We invite the United Nations and interested Member States to share their experience with similar assessments.  Fifthly, and finally, Germany has enhanced its military observer training course to focus specifically on the role of women in peacekeeping. We have opened the course to international participants; 22 women from 20 countries were part of the pilot course last year. This success has encouraged us to offer this course again,  on a permanent basis. I invite all present to help us promote this opportunity.  Let me conclude by expressing my gratitude to all present for their contributions today. The peacekeepers' Blue Helmet symbolizes protection and security. Let us ensure that this helmet is worn by more women, for the sake of peace.  I now resume my functions as President of the Council.

The Security Council needs to stand with the survivors.  I shall now make a statement in my capacity as Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany.  ""There is nothing I can do to forget all this."" The woman who uttered these words is sitting at this table: Ms. Nadia Murad. All of us in this Chamber know her story; all of us know what this sentence is about.  When we talk about sexual violence in conflict, we are talking about her story. But we are also talking about thousands of other stories that have never been told to the world, stories hauntingly similar to Ms. Murad's story, stories that could be told by many Rohingya women in Myanmar or by girls in Syria, where sexual violence is used as a weapon of war.  Almost 20 years after the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), that is the grim reality of almost all conflict. Resolution 1325 (2000) was a milestone, but reality shows that its implementation is lagging behind - we must do more. We must take three important steps forward.  First, we must strengthen accountability. We must strengthen the channels through which information on non-compliance reaches the Security Council and its sanctions committees. We want to ensure that sexual violence has consequences, including through targeted sanctions. Of course, we also need to ensure that crimes are prosecuted, including at the national level. After all, the failure to bring perpetrators of sexual violence in conflict to justice fosters a deadly culture of impunity.  In Germany, the Prosecutor General began in 2014 to investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Sham in Iraq and Syria. Our legal system is working closely on that with the relevant United Nations Special Envoy and others should follow that example.  Secondly, we must place the victims - the survivors of sexual violence - at the heart of our work. That is why draft resolution S/2019/328, which we have proposed, calls on all States Members of the United Nations to support such survivors by providing better access to justice, medical and psychological services, as well as reintegration support, in other words by enabling them to live their lives with dignity. Only when we help victims to achieve justice, when we hear their voices and let them testify, are we giving survivors the chance to stop being victims.  Thirdly, we must focus on those who are not yet getting enough attention, such as the boys and men who have experienced sexual violence and the mothers who give birth as a result of wartime rape and their children. Those who have survived sexual violence often remain victims long after the crimes have been committed. They are stigmatized and cast out - and that is horrible.  Yet the horror does not stop there. Sexual violence not only affects the survivors but it also destroys the society they live in. That makes the path to peace all the more difficult. If you destroy women, you destroy the family and eventually the entire village. That is how Dr. Mukwege, who is also in the Chamber today, once put it.  Dr. Mukwege saved the lives of tens of thousands of women in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, like Nadia Murad. They share a bond in their inspiring fight for justice. We have to do all we can to help them in that fight - not only politically, through the draft resolution that Germany is proposing, but also financially. That is why we have earmarked â‚¬400,000 that we will use to support their work and the survivors of sexual violence in conflict.  There is nothing I can do to forget all this. Nadia Murad's statement sent a chill down our spine. It sends a clear and powerful message not to forget and to open our eyes and use all the means we have to fight to ensure her story is not repeated.

UNSC_2019_SPV.8649_spch017.txt,2019,8649,"The President: I thank Ms. Salah for her briefing, and I thank the guests present here for their applause. I had been wondering whether people applaud at the United Nations, because I am a stranger to this organ. I am therefore very pleased to see that there is a human element present. I notice that many participants are looking at their cell phones as the discussion continues. I hope that they are tweeting that they support all the demands that have been put to them this morning.  I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the Minister for International Relations and Cooperation of South Africa.  My name is Naledi Pandor, and I wish to begin by acknowledging the Security Council for its adoption of resolution 2493 (2019), just a few moments ago. We are absolutely thrilled at the unanimity that was indicated in that adoption. I am told that that is a welcome return to consensus in the Council, and we are extremely pleased at that.  I wish to thank everybody here for participating in our discussion today. In particular, I wish to thank all those who provided us with such significant briefings in the course of our deliberations. As we have heard, women from diverse contexts across the world continue to face obstacles and resistance. They continue to bear the brunt of armed conflict, and their personal, economic, civil and political security is persistently undermined.  Women's efforts to ensure their participation in peace processes continue not to receive a positive response. Ifwe fail to address the barriers in the next 20 years and beyond, then we will have to face the fact that we are falling far short of our ambitions to realize the objectives that we set as an international community. Together, the United Nations, Member States, regional organizations, civil society and other actors supporting peace processes must hold each other accountable to maintain and go beyond current progress in the area of women and peace and security and its agenda by 2020.  Everybody's participation today in this important meeting confirms the significance of the women and peace and security agenda. The myriad and complex conflicts in the world serve to underscore the need to reinforce the implementation of that agenda and its related actions. Resolution 1325 (2000), which was adopted 19 years ago in October, and its subsequent resolutions underpin the women and peace and security international normative framework.  We in South Africa View the women and peace and security agenda as a means for women to mediate in conflict situations and as an essential tool for ending the use of force as a means of settling disputes. The report of the Secretary-General (S/2019/800) that we have before us provides us with a useful overview of the successes and gaps in the implementation of that agenda. It gives us concrete recommendations that can move us from rhetoric to action, so that we can effectively implement the commitments that we have set ourselves. Women are tired of us talking. Women want action. Women want change.  It is within that context that we in South Africa saw it fit to present a draft resolution (8/2019/841) focused on the full implementation of the women and peace and security agenda. Resolution 2493 (2019) now recognizes that, although there has been progress, there is still a great deal that we must do.  As we exchange views on how to strengthen implementation, particularly as we move towards the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), it is also imperative for us as the international community to take into account the findings and the recommendations of the 2015 Global Study on the Implementation of United Nations Security Council resolution 1325 - the study commissioned by this very organ needs to be taken into account. We believe that some of those recommendations from 2015 are still relevant in terms of elaborating practical and attainable deliverables. It is also for that reason that we in South Africa have advocated for its inclusion, in order to embolden the message on the full implementation of the agenda outlined in resolution 1325 (2000).  Our deliverables must be visible and discernible. They must be clearly aimed at ensuring the meaningful participation of women at all levels of peace processes; increasing the number of women in uniformed and civilian components of peacekeeping operations; investing in women as peacebuilders, such as in mediation and negotiation; protecting the human rights of women, particularly sexual and reproductive health  rights; and advancing accountability for heinous crimes such as sexual violence.  South Africa has been a proponent of the women and peace and security agenda since its inception. We remain committed to implementing the agenda so that it can support and contribute to silencing the guns across the world, as well as work towards saving succeeding generations from the scourge ofwar, as we committed to do at the founding of this very Organization. Our country has been engaged in training women across all of these areas. We are therefore optimistic that operationalizing the Global Alliance of Regional Women Mediators Networks will advance some of these objectives. We are not speaking empty rhetoric when we refer to the participation of women - we have women here from our various armed forces in South Africa and our police service who have served in peacekeeping missions. They are here to observe our continued commitment to serving areas of the world in which there is conflict. I would like to ask those women in uniform to stand. They have served and therefore deserve recognition. I know that I am breaching all diplomatic rules, but it is unfortunate that they appointed a novice as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  On peacekeeping, South Africa will continue to ensure the meaningful participation of women in peace support operations. Currently, our national defence force comprises 30 per cent women. That has enabled South Africa, as a troop-contributing country to United Nations peacekeeping missions, to deploy more females on the front lines of armed conflicts. The South African contingent of the Force Intervention Brigade of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is composed of 14.5 per cent women, and the officer commanding the South African force is a woman. During our side event here at the United Nations on women in peacekeeping, which was held yesterday afternoon, these women shared experiences on how to achieve the goals we have set to increase the representation of women in peace support operations. We are pleased that the United Nations uniformed personnel gender-parity strategy clearly indicates the quotas and time frames that must be reached to increase the number of women deployed as military, police, corrections andjustice personnel. As a supporter of collective approaches to address issues that affect us all, South Africa will continue to actively participate in existing global initiatives, such as the Women, Peace and Security Focal Points Network; the  Elsie Initiative for Women in Peace Operations; and the Secretary-General's Action for Peacekeeping initiative. We find these initiatives useful in that they also serve as instruments to raise awareness on the importance of the women and peace and security agenda.  As I conclude, let us agree to commit today to continue to advance the cause of women and of peace and security and the agenda thereto by ensuring that we implement the recommendations and guidelines emanating from existing resolutions. Our contributions all indicate that we know what must be done - perhaps we need to devote a sharper focus on why we are failing to act in pursuit of agreed objectives. Once we have identified the real barriers, we will probably then begin to make greater progress.  I now resume my functions as President of the Council.  I shall now give the floor to the other Council members who wish to make statements.  I call on the Minister of State at the Federal Foreign Office of Germany.  ",The President,,English,u," I thank Ms. Salah for her briefing, and I thank the guests present here for their applause. I had been wondering whether people applaud at the United Nations, because I am a stranger to this organ. I am therefore very pleased to see that there is a human element present. I notice that many participants are looking at their cell phones as the discussion continues. I hope that they are tweeting that they support all the demands that have been put to them this morning.  I shall now make a statement in my capacity as the Minister for International Relations and Cooperation of South Africa.  My name is Naledi Pandor, and I wish to begin by acknowledging the Security Council for its adoption of resolution 2493 (2019), just a few moments ago. We are absolutely thrilled at the unanimity that was indicated in that adoption. I am told that that is a welcome return to consensus in the Council, and we are extremely pleased at that.  I wish to thank everybody here for participating in our discussion today. In particular, I wish to thank all those who provided us with such significant briefings in the course of our deliberations. As we have heard, women from diverse contexts across the world continue to face obstacles and resistance. They continue to bear the brunt of armed conflict, and their personal, economic, civil and political security is persistently undermined.  Women's efforts to ensure their participation in peace processes continue not to receive a positive response. Ifwe fail to address the barriers in the next 20 years and beyond, then we will have to face the fact that we are falling far short of our ambitions to realize the objectives that we set as an international community. Together, the United Nations, Member States, regional organizations, civil society and other actors supporting peace processes must hold each other accountable to maintain and go beyond current progress in the area of women and peace and security and its agenda by 2020.  Everybody's participation today in this important meeting confirms the significance of the women and peace and security agenda. The myriad and complex conflicts in the world serve to underscore the need to reinforce the implementation of that agenda and its related actions. Resolution 1325 (2000), which was adopted 19 years ago in October, and its subsequent resolutions underpin the women and peace and security international normative framework.  We in South Africa View the women and peace and security agenda as a means for women to mediate in conflict situations and as an essential tool for ending the use of force as a means of settling disputes. The report of the Secretary-General (S/2019/800) that we have before us provides us with a useful overview of the successes and gaps in the implementation of that agenda. It gives us concrete recommendations that can move us from rhetoric to action, so that we can effectively implement the commitments that we have set ourselves. Women are tired of us talking. Women want action. Women want change.  It is within that context that we in South Africa saw it fit to present a draft resolution (8/2019/841) focused on the full implementation of the women and peace and security agenda. Resolution 2493 (2019) now recognizes that, although there has been progress, there is still a great deal that we must do.  As we exchange views on how to strengthen implementation, particularly as we move towards the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), it is also imperative for us as the international community to take into account the findings and the recommendations of the 2015 Global Study on the Implementation of United Nations Security Council resolution 1325 - the study commissioned by this very organ needs to be taken into account. We believe that some of those recommendations from 2015 are still relevant in terms of elaborating practical and attainable deliverables. It is also for that reason that we in South Africa have advocated for its inclusion, in order to embolden the message on the full implementation of the agenda outlined in resolution 1325 (2000).  Our deliverables must be visible and discernible. They must be clearly aimed at ensuring the meaningful participation of women at all levels of peace processes; increasing the number of women in uniformed and civilian components of peacekeeping operations; investing in women as peacebuilders, such as in mediation and negotiation; protecting the human rights of women, particularly sexual and reproductive health  rights; and advancing accountability for heinous crimes such as sexual violence.

I shall now make a statement in my national capacity.  I wanted to say that we share the strong support that has been expressed for the visit by the Deputy Secretary-General and Ambassador Mohammed. I think that it has been a fantastic venture in highlighting how central the women and peace and security agenda is to African peace and security. The United Kingdom strongly supports all our colleagues who have called today for increasing the numbers of women in political processes in general and in peace processes in particular. In turn, I think that means that there must be an even greater focus on the issue of girls' education so that we can start to help young girls and women take their rightful place at the top tables of their communities and nations. I would like to mention several country- specific examples. The United Kingdom has a strong partnership with Somalia in serving and protecting women and girls. We work to include women in reconciliation efforts, security reform and political dialogue and to address sexual and gender-based violence, and we support access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care. I very much endorse what others have said today about the full, equal and meaningful participation of women in Somalia's upcoming elections. We encourage Somalia to maintain its commitment to the 30 per cent quota for women in Parliament, and we hope to see the bills on sexual offences and female genital mutilation making swift progress through the Somali legislature.  Turning to the Sudan, I think that the Security Council wishes the Sudan well and wants to do everything it can to support it. The United Kingdom feels the same way. At the General Assembly in September we were delighted to hear the Prime Minister reiterate his commitment to women's full participation in Government (see A/74/PV.10). We have all referred to Alaa Salah's very important contribution to last week's open debate (see S/PV.8649), and I think we look forward to even greater engagement and participation in public life for women.  We were very pleased that the Deputy Secretary- General was able to visit Eritrea. There is a clear opportunity for real change in United Nations and African Union engagement with Eritrea, following its historic agreement with Ethiopia and the lifting of sanctions. We believe that it is essential that increased international engagement deliver further improvements in regional security and concrete progress on human rights there.  Finally, with regard to Ethiopia, I join other colleagues in paying tribute to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and the award to him of the Nobel Peace Prize, which is an important testimony to his role in promoting peace in the region and political reform at home. What everyone has said about the Ethiopian President is extremely important. It is very good that 50 per cent of Ethiopia's Cabinet positions are reserved for women, and that may be a lesson for all of us. We hope to see Ethiopia build on that progress and promote women's participation as voters and candidates in upcoming elections, as well as reforming security and justice institutions to make them more responsive to the needs of women and girls. The continued outbreaks of violence in Ethiopia are concerning, however, and they highlight the need for all actors to work to reform institutions and the importance of peaceful dialogue. We wanted to make this meeting interactive. I therefore would like to ask a few questions, if I may, in addition to those that my colleagues have already raised.  First, with regard to girls' education, how can we make sure that increased investment in girls' education translates into women's economic empowerment? I think the Indonesian Ambassador already asked what practical steps would improve women's participation in peacekeeping. The Deputy Secretary-General has given us some, but if there is more that can be said in that regard, we look forward to it. Besides that, what additional support do our briefers think women mediators and civil-society actors need so that they can strengthen their participation in political dialogue?  I now resume my functions as President of the Council.  I would like to invite first the Deputy Secretary- General and then the observer of the African Union to respond to the good number of questions that have been asked today.
