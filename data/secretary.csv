UNSC_2000_SPV.4208_spch002.txt,2000,4208,"The Secretary-General: Let me thank and congratulate the presidency of the Security Council for its initiative in holding this meeting on women and armed conflict. The theme chosen is crucial, for it brings together two vital parts of the United Nations mission. The Charter tells us that the Organization was created ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"". It also proclaims the equal rights of men and women. We must live up to both challenges or we shall not succeed fully in either.  As this Council knows better than anyone, the nature of conflict has changed a great deal in the decades since our Charter was written. The age of inter-State wars has been replaced by the age of ethnic conflict. Militias have multiplied, and small arms have proliferated. International law has been flouted. Civilians not only make up the majority of victims; they are increasingly the targets of conflict. From rape and displacement to the denial of the right to food and health care, women bear more than their fair share of the suffering.  But women, who know the price of conflict so well, are also often better equipped than men to prevent or resolve it. For generations women have served as peace educators, both in their families and in their societies. They have proved instrumental in building bridges rather than walls. They have been crucial in preserving social order when communities have collapsed.  We in the United Nations know at first hand the invaluable support women provide to our peacekeepers, by organizing committees, non- governmental organizations and church groups that help ease tensions and by persuading their menfolk to accept peace. Partly for that reason, we are making special efforts to recruit more women for our peacekeeping and peacemaking missions, and to make all our operations more aware of gender issues.  The United Nations has learned the hard way that peace and security depends on rapid response to early indications of conflict. We know that conflict prevention requires imaginative strategies. We know that conflict resolution, peacekeeping and peace- building call for creative and flexible approaches. In all these areas, we have seen examples of women playing an important role - not least on my own continent, Africa.  And yet the potential contribution of women to peace and security remains severely under-valued. Women are still grossly under-represented at the decision-making level, from conflict prevention to conflict resolution to post-conflict reconciliation.  We are here today because we are determined to change that, and because we know that changing it is the responsibility of all of us - men and women alike. This Council, in its statement on International Women's Day this year, acknowledged that women and girls are particularly affected by the consequences of armed conflict. The Council recognized that peace is inextricably linked to equality between men and women and it declared that maintaining and promoting peace and security require women's equal participation in decision-making.  I am here today to ask the Council to do everything in its power to translate that statement into action; to help ensure that women and girls in conflict situations are protected, that perpetrators of violence against women in conflict are brought to justice, and that women are able to take their rightful and equal place at the decision-making table on questions of peace and security. I am confident that Ms. King, Ms. Heyzer and others who will speak here today will help show the way.

UNSC_2002_SPV.4635_spch002.txt,2002,4635,"The Secretary-General: Let me start by thanking you, Mr. President, for your initiative in holding this meeting on women, peace and security.  Two years ago, the Security Council adopted resolution 1325 (2000), a landmark step in raising awareness of the impact of armed conflict on women and girls, and of the vital role women play in conflict resolution and peace-building.  Since then, the Council has continued to devote close attention to this key aspect of international peace and security. It has used the Arria formula to hear directly from women living in countries mired in conflict. During missions to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kosovo and Sierra Leone, Council members have met with women's groups and networks, and last July the Council held a further open discussion on the issue.  Resolution 1325 (2000) has also galvanized the United Nations system into looking more critically at our own work, and at how we deal with gender perspectives not only in peacemaking, peace-building and peacekeeping, but also in humanitarian, disarmament and reconstruction activities.  More importantly, women at the grassroots level around the world have found the resolution an effective tool in bringing greater attention to their needs and priorities and in supporting their efforts to contribute to peace processes.  My report on women, peace and security, called for in resolution 1325 (2000), is now before the Council. It is based on the larger study distributed to the Council earlier this week. I hope that members will read it closely and sustain the momentum that has been generated. Towards that end, I would like to draw the Council's attention to a few issues.  The report stresses that, while many of the experiences of women and girls in armed conflict are similar to those of men and boys, there are important differences. Existing inequalities between women and men, and patterns of discrimination against women and girls, tend to exacerbate their situation in armed conflict.  Women and girls become particularly vulnerable to sexual violence and exploitation. Women and children make up the majority of the world's refugees and internally displaced persons. Even in refugee camps, which are meant to be safe havens, the vulnerability of women and girls may continue, especially if there is a proliferation of small arms. Some women may be forced to follow camps of armed forces, providing domestic services or being used as sexual slaves.  But if women suffer the impact of conflict disproportionately, they are also the key to the solution of conflict. Women's groups and networks at the grassroots level have provided many examples of the imaginative strategies and flexible approaches required for effective conflict prevention. They have worked tirelessly and courageously in preserving social order in the midst of chaos, and promoting reconciliation through informal processes that receive very little support. However, with few exceptions, women are not present in formal peace negotiations.  The report calls for greater representation of women in formal peace negotiations and for the incorporation of gender perspectives in conflict prevention activities and in mandates for peace- building and peacekeeping operations, including those set in motion by the Council. It also stresses the need to increase the appointment of women at the highest levels of decision-making, including as special representatives, deputy special representatives and special envoys.  The report also points out serious gaps in the legal protections available to women. Certainly, advances have been made in recognizing women's rights. The legal framework is increasingly responsive to the experiences of women and girls in conflict, especially in cases of sexual violence, as we have seen in the important work being carried out by the international criminal tribunals. But much remains to be done, particularly to improve prevention and to combat impunity.  The report recommends the strongest possible response to the sexual exploitation of women and girls, including prostitution and trafficking, which can occur in the context of peacekeeping, humanitarian activities and other international interventions. The United Nations and its Member States, in particular troop- contributing States, must do their utmost to ensure that an international presence provides protection and security for all people - women and men, girls and boys - and does not exacerbate inequalities or lead to an increase in violence against women and girls. The United Nations must not and will not tolerate sexual or other abuse by any staff - civilian, military or humanitarian.  Two important steps in this direction are the investigation by the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) of allegations of sexual abuse in West Africa, the results of which were made public earlier this week, and the work of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Task Force on Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in Humanitarian Crises.  Since the allegations leading to the OIOS report first arose, the United Nations has been determined to act firmly and quickly, not just in West Africa, but on a global basis. Improved systems for recourse, investigation and discipline are being instituted. Mechanisms for protecting those who depend on international aid are being strengthened, and strict  standards of behaviour - expected of all United Nations personnel and our partners in the non- governmental organization community - are being  adopted. I welcome those steps and reaffirm my commitment to working closely with all involved to ensure full and speedy action wherever necessary.  Finally, the report emphasizes the need for extensive capacity-building. If women are to play their full part in negotiating peace accords, mediating disputes, creating new Governments, rebuilding judicial and civil infrastructures and the many other activities that support peace, the world needs to make an investment in building up their skills for doing so. This will require both political will and a much larger pool of funding.  In addition to my own study and report, an Independent Experts Assessment, commissioned by the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), has been made available to you. Elisabeth Rehn and Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf travelled to many of the world's conflict zones and talked to women and girls who have experienced the devastating impact of conflict firsthand. Their analysis, insight and recommendations provide additional food for thought to this Council, as well as for the wider membership, the United Nations system and civil society.  The world can no longer afford to neglect the abuses to which women and girls are subjected in armed conflict and its aftermath, or to ignore the contributions that women make to the search for peace. It is time that they are given the voice in formal peace- building and peacemaking processes that they deserve. Sustainable peace and security will not be achieved without their full and equal participation. Just as your work can promote gender equality, so can gender equality make your work more likely to succeed.

UNSC_2005_SPV.5294_spch002.txt,2005,5294,"The Deputy Secretary-General: First, let me thank you, Mr. President, for convening this open debate to mark the fifth anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000) and for devoting it to the topic of women's participation in peace processes.  The principle of women's participation is at the heart of resolution 1325 (2000). That landmark document called on Member States to ensure increased representation of women at all decision-making levels.  Awareness and recognition of that issue have grown considerably in recent years, both in conflict- affected societies and in the international community. Yet five years after resolution 1325 (2000) was adopted, in most parts of the world - and particularly in those suffering from armed conflict - women are still not adequately represented at the negotiating table, the Cabinet table or the conference table. Clearly, Governments must redouble their efforts.  So must we in the United Nations itself. We need to appoint more women at senior levels of peace operations, and in that we must be more proactive. But we also rely on Member States to present us with strong candidates.  We need to develop a more systematic approach to consulting with women in the earliest stages of a peace process, including in discussions on constitutional development, judicial reform and reconciliation. And we need to maintain the utmost vigilance in preventing further instances of sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations personnel and peacekeepers, which have caused such damage to the standing of our peace operations and have inflicted such wounds on the very people we are working to help.  In a moment, the Council will hear a statement from Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno, who will present an update on the progress of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations towards the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). They will also hear from Ms. Rachel Mayanja, Special Adviser to the Secretary- General on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, about the Secretary-General's report of 10 October on women and peace and security (S/2005/636), which contains a system-wide action plan on the implementation of the resolution. In addition, the Council will hear a statement from Ms. Noeleen Heyzer, Executive Director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women.  The Secretariat looks forward to the Council's advice and practical support in carrying out initiatives to implement resolution 1325 (2000), in finding better ways to empower women, in sharing good practices and in enhancing women's role in decision-making at all levels. I hope this debate will help move that process forward. In that spirit, I wish members a most successful meeting.

UNSC_2007_SPV.5766_spch002.txt,2007,5766,"The Secretary-General: I am honoured to address the Council for the first time as Secretary- General on the vital subject of women and peace and security. We have gathered to discuss the implementation of a landmark resolution. Since the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), seven years ago, Member States have made significant progress. More and more, women are participating in mediating and negotiating peace, in searching for justice, in fostering reconciliation, in supporting disarmament and demobilization and in shaping development policies and rebuilding institutions.  More and more, the Security Council is ensuring that peace processes empower women and advance gender equality. More and more, United Nations entities are working closely and actively with Governments and women's organizations, including through the United Nations System-wide Action Plan on implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). 07-55817 But there is so much left to do, both for the United Nations and for Member States. More countries in conflict or post-conflict situations need to establish their own national action plans. They need to take greater ownership of programmes and priorities in implementing resolution 1325 (2000). They need to identify the capacity-building and the technical and financial support needed to scale up programmes for implementation, and they need to strengthen approaches to monitoring, evaluation and accountability.  For our part, we in the United Nations system must take a more evenly coordinated approach than we have done so far. We need to work better with Governments to establish truly joint programmes driven by national priorities. We need to clarify the roles and responsibilities of United Nations entities at the country level. We need to work better as a team, so as to give countries access to a common entry point.  And we need to appoint more women in leadership positions in our peace operations around the world. I am delighted that Ambassador Ellen Margrethe LÂ¢j of Denmark has agreed to serve as my Special Representative for Liberia. She will be heading one of our biggest peacekeeping missions, and I know she will provide a shining example of the kind of qualities we need in our leaders in the field.  Violence against women has reached hideous and pandemic proportions in some societies attempting to recover from conflict. Together, all of us need to strengthen our collective and individual responses to it. That is essential if we are to reverse the damage done by conflict and to build more inclusive, accountable and cohesive societies, underpinned by viable democratic institutions.  Earlier this year, I urged the Security Council to establish a mechanism dedicated to monitoring violence against women and girls within the framework of resolution 1325 (2000). I reiterate that call today. I also encourage Member States to actively consider proposals to strengthen the Organization's gender architecture, as presented by the High-level Panel on United Nations System-wide Coherence.

UNSC_2008_SPV.5916_spch002.txt,2008,5916,"The Secretary-General: I thank the United States for having taken the initiative to convene this important debate. I congratulate Secretary of State Rice for her leadership. It is critical that the Council devote its full attention to this issue. I look forward to hearing its Views on the way forward.  Almost eight years after the Council adopted its landmark resolution 1325 (2000), an increasing and alarming number of women and girls are falling victim to sexual violence in conflict. Sexual violence poses a grave threat to women's security in fragile post- conflict countries and undermines efforts to cement peace. It strikes women who are already struggling to survive and to keep their families together in a generalized climate of fear. The breakdown of law and order makes women all the more vulnerable to attacks and leaves them with virtually no recourse to justice. Survivors are often so badly stigmatized that they can hardly even hope for a normal life. Cast out by their societies, they rarely seek redress. Even when they do have the courage to come forward despite the humiliation that that can bring, the justice system too often fails, and perpetrators go free. That fuels a culture of impunity that does nothing to discourage more attacks. So, the vicious circle rolls forward.  But we can and must push back. This March, I launched a global campaign to end violence against women. The aim is to tackle all of its manifestations, including the abominable practice of sexual violence in armed conflict. I will soon appoint a Messenger of Peace tasked entirely with advocacy for ending violence against women.  Around the world, United Nations peace missions are making a difference by monitoring the programme, helping the victims and advocating an end to impunity. The United Nations Mission in Liberia has built a safe house for survivors and victims of sexual and gender- based violence. In Haiti, our peacekeepers are organizing meetings on women's rights for members of the judiciary and police. Our Rule of Law Unit in Afghanistan is helping the country draft legislation to eliminate violence against women. The United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo has created a special unit to ensure that victims receive help when they seekjustice.  All of those initiatives are based on Security Council mandates. When the Council adopts resolutions with strong language on sexual and gender- based violence, the United Nations can respond more forcefully. Let us ensure that all future mandates have clear provisions on protecting women and children in conflict situations. When the Council authorizes multidisciplinary missions, we can produce results. When Member States send us qualified female personnel, we can demonstrate the central role of women in restoring stability to war-ravaged countries.  The concept paper before the Council cites the all-female Indian civil police unit in Liberia as a possible model. I believe that successful initiative serves as an excellent example of the unique contribution that female personnel can make. Through their sheer presence, the members of that Indian contingent are showing Liberian women that they, too, can play a role in law enforcement. We have the numbers to prove it. Since the female Blue Berets were first deployed, there has been a marked increase in the number of women applying for jobs with the Liberian police.  I am eager to deploy more women worldwide, not just as police, military and civilian personnel, but also at the highest levels of mission leadership. Therefore, I need Member States to come forward with more women candidates. Send me your female troops, your police, your civilian personnel and your senior diplomats, and I will ensure that they all are 08-39069 considered, that qualified candidates are placed on rosters and that the maximum number are deployed to the field as quickly as humanly possible.  The troop-contributing countries are already moving in that direction, and I appreciate all of their contributions to United Nations peacekeeping. But at the same time, I urge them to do more to provide predeployment training for preventing and responding to sexual violence. The Department of Peacekeeping Operations is revising its standardized materials on that project, and we look to the troop-contributing countries to help ensure that United Nations personnel are part of the solution and not the problem.  Let me be clear. The United Nations and I personally are profoundly committed to a zero- tolerance policy against sexual exploitation or abuse by our own personnel. That means zero complacency. When we receive credible allegations, we ensure that they are looked into fully. That means zero impunity. When allegations are found to have merit, all personnel, whether military, police or civilian, are held accountable on the basis of the applicable national jurisdiction. I will strengthen the current code of conduct by upholding the strictest discipline, whereby not only the individual concerned but also supervisors up the chain of command are held accountable in a system of collective responsibility.  Violence against women has reached unspeakable and pandemic proportions in some societies attempting to recover from conflict. Responding to the silent war against women and girls requires leadership at the national level. National authorities need to take the initiative to build comprehensive strategies, while the United Nations needs to help build capacity and support national authorities and civil society.  Responding to calls from women's groups, rape survivors and non-governmental organizations, we are bringing together a dozen United Nations entities in a concerted effort called the United Nations Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict. The initiative brings together experts on issues such as peacekeeping, development, HIV/AIDS, reproductive health, human rights, humanitarian relief and gender concerns to help stop rape and other sexual crimes in conflict-torn countries.  We know what it takes for a strategy to succeed. It takes awareness-raising. It takes effective security measures, including training for national military and police forces. It takes close monitoring of human rights, and it requires prosecuting all perpetrators to the full extent of the law.  At the same time, we must View this problem in the broader context of women's empowerment. That means revising not only laws that deal with violence, but also laws that affect women's rights with respect to other issues, such as poverty, inheritance or divorce. It means creating conditions where justice can flourish, because the best laws in the world will mean little if they are not enforced through strong judicial and penal systems.  Above all, we must do far more to involve women in conflict prevention, peace negotiations and recovery after the guns fall silent. We must have more women participating in the process of seeking justice, fostering reconciliation, supporting disarmament and demobilization, shaping development policies and rebuilding institutions. By creating a culture that punishes violence and elevates women to their rightful role, we can lay the foundation for lasting stability, where women are not victims of violence but agents of peace.  ",The Secretary-General,,English,u," I thank the United States for having taken the initiative to convene this important debate. I congratulate Secretary of State Rice for her leadership. It is critical that the Council devote its full attention to this issue. I look forward to hearing its Views on the way forward.  Almost eight years after the Council adopted its landmark resolution 1325 (2000), an increasing and alarming number of women and girls are falling victim to sexual violence in conflict. Sexual violence poses a grave threat to women's security in fragile post- conflict countries and undermines efforts to cement peace. It strikes women who are already struggling to survive and to keep their families together in a generalized climate of fear. The breakdown of law and order makes women all the more vulnerable to attacks and leaves them with virtually no recourse to justice. Survivors are often so badly stigmatized that they can hardly even hope for a normal life. Cast out by their societies, they rarely seek redress. Even when they do have the courage to come forward despite the humiliation that that can bring, the justice system too often fails, and perpetrators go free. That fuels a culture of impunity that does nothing to discourage more attacks. So, the vicious circle rolls forward.  But we can and must push back. This March, I launched a global campaign to end violence against women. The aim is to tackle all of its manifestations, including the abominable practice of sexual violence in armed conflict. I will soon appoint a Messenger of Peace tasked entirely with advocacy for ending violence against women.  Around the world, United Nations peace missions are making a difference by monitoring the programme, helping the victims and advocating an end to impunity. The United Nations Mission in Liberia has built a safe house for survivors and victims of sexual and gender- based violence. In Haiti, our peacekeepers are organizing meetings on women's rights for members of the judiciary and police. Our Rule of Law Unit in Afghanistan is helping the country draft legislation to eliminate violence against women. The United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo has created a special unit to ensure that victims receive help when they seekjustice.  All of those initiatives are based on Security Council mandates. When the Council adopts resolutions with strong language on sexual and gender- based violence, the United Nations can respond more forcefully. Let us ensure that all future mandates have clear provisions on protecting women and children in conflict situations. When the Council authorizes multidisciplinary missions, we can produce results. When Member States send us qualified female personnel, we can demonstrate the central role of women in restoring stability to war-ravaged countries.  The concept paper before the Council cites the all-female Indian civil police unit in Liberia as a possible model. I believe that successful initiative serves as an excellent example of the unique contribution that female personnel can make. Through their sheer presence, the members of that Indian contingent are showing Liberian women that they, too, can play a role in law enforcement. We have the numbers to prove it. Since the female Blue Berets were first deployed, there has been a marked increase in the number of women applying for jobs with the Liberian police.  I am eager to deploy more women worldwide, not just as police, military and civilian personnel, but also at the highest levels of mission leadership. Therefore, I need Member States to come forward with more women candidates. Send me your female troops, your police, your civilian personnel and your senior diplomats, and I will ensure that they all are 08-39069 considered, that qualified candidates are placed on rosters and that the maximum number are deployed to the field as quickly as humanly possible.  The troop-contributing countries are already moving in that direction, and I appreciate all of their contributions to United Nations peacekeeping. But at the same time, I urge them to do more to provide predeployment training for preventing and responding to sexual violence. The Department of Peacekeeping Operations is revising its standardized materials on that project, and we look to the troop-contributing countries to help ensure that United Nations personnel are part of the solution and not the problem.  Let me be clear. The United Nations and I personally are profoundly committed to a zero- tolerance policy against sexual exploitation or abuse by our own personnel. That means zero complacency. When we receive credible allegations, we ensure that they are looked into fully. That means zero impunity. When allegations are found to have merit, all personnel, whether military, police or civilian, are held accountable on the basis of the applicable national jurisdiction. I will strengthen the current code of conduct by upholding the strictest discipline, whereby not only the individual concerned but also supervisors up the chain of command are held accountable in a system of collective responsibility.

UNSC_2008_SPV.5916_spch008.txt,2008,5916,"The Deputy Secretary-General: Let me join the Secretary-General in commending the United States for its initiative to convene this very important meeting. I want to pay special tribute to you, Madam President, for your leadership and commitment in this regard. Under the guidance of the Secretary-General, the United Nations has been vigorously working to prevent sexual violence in situations of armed conflict. Just last month, the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), on behalf of the United Nations Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict, to which the Secretary-General has referred, hosted a high-level conference on the role of military peacekeepers and others in responding to this scourge. A number of former Force Commanders participating in that conference conceded that more needs to be done to protect women and children from widespread and systematic sexual violence in conflict situations. We are taking measures, conscious of the challenge we are facing in addressing the problem. The conference agreed that the credibility of peacekeeping operations ought to be measured by how successful they are in this respect, and it reached broad agreement on the fact that the profound insecurity perpetuated by sexual violence must be addressed at the political and tactical levels.  The adoption in 2000 of resolution 1325 (2000) demonstrated that sexual violence in conflict is not just a gender issue; it is a fundamental security concern. And the fact that the Security Council is holding this meeting today sends another clear signal that sexual and gender-based violence in conflict is within the remit of the Council.  That fact is critical to improving our operational approach. When the Council renewed the mandate of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo last December, it adopted strong language, setting a precedent for requiring specific responses to and reporting on sexual violence.  Gender units in most peacekeeping operations are working with key stakeholders, including uniformed peacekeeping personnel, national authorities, women's organizations and other sectors of civil society in efforts to combat sexual and gender-based violence. All missions have underlined training as an important strategy to mobilize priority attention to this problem among peacekeeping personnel and national partners.  The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is undertaking numerous measures as well, including monitoring, investigating and documenting sexual and gender- based violence as a human rights issue.  These critical activities are part of our broader efforts to change attitudes to sexual and gender-based violence. This will require re-evaluating cultural practices and judicial systems to ensure that they are fully inclusive and that they guarantee the protection of women against all forms of abuse.  Sexual violence has not only grave physical, psychological and health consequences for its victims but also direct social consequences for communities and entire societies. Impunity for sexual violence committed during conflict perpetuates a tolerance of abuse against women and girls and leaves a damaging legacy by hindering national reconciliation.  Tackling this complex problem on all fronts will require the combined effort of all, including Governments, the United Nations System, civil society organizations and non-governmental organizations. In this regard, one of our greatest assets are women themselves. If we promote the full and equal participation of women in the security sector, we can ensure that security services effectively identify and respond to their needs.  The road ahead is long, but today's Council meeting is a crucial step forward. Let us maintain this forward momentum not only to protect women in conflict situations, but to secure lasting peace for all.

UNSC_2009_SPV.6180_spch002.txt,2009,6180,"The Secretary-General: I commend your initiative, Mr. President, to convene this Security Council debate on one of the important priorities of the United Nations: women, peace and security.  Despite some progress over two decades, the deliberate targeting of civilians through acts of sexual violence continues on a widespread and systematic basis. Parties to armed conflict continue to use sexual violence with efficient brutality. Like a grenade or a gun, sexual violence is part of their arsenal to pursue military, political, social and economic aims. The perpetrators generally operate with impunity.  I have met victims of sexual violence. I am haunted by their testimony, and I will not relent in calling on States and non-State parties to prevent those terrible crimes. Beyond its enormous toll on victims, sexual violence in armed conflict hurts recovery and peacebuilding. In Burundi, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the fighting may have ended but sexual violence persists on a very serious scale. We are helping those countries to recover, but we must also do more to prevent others from suffering the same fate.  My report (S/2009/362) highlights where States and other parties must act. I also call on the Security Council to focus on concrete actions. Allow me to briefly underscore four areas. 09-44842  First, preventing and responding to sexual violence requires a multisectoral response, the pillars of which are interdependent. The efforts of the United Nations system reach across our main work areas from the normative to the operational. I am committed to strengthening the United Nations system to ensure that we deliver as one.  Secondly, sexual violence should be addressed from the planning to the implementation of mandates. Our actions must be focused and sustained over time to achieve results, as the causes and consequences of sexual violence are often intractable. I am pleased that the issue will be included in the terms of reference for technical assessment missions and the integrated mission planning process. Peacekeeping missions and United Nations country teams will establish joint priorities in that regard through integrated strategic frameworks.  I am also working with my top advisers to ensure that the United Nations gives priority attention to preventing and responding to sexual violence. Yesterday, in my meeting with force commanders, I gave a clear and strong instruction that military leaders should keep that issue as the top priority in working to maintain peace and security. I call on Council members and other States, as well as civilian and military leaders, to join forces to address that grave problem. I repeat: N0 act of sexual exploitation and abuse by any United Nations personnel will be tolerated.  Thirdly, I urge the General Assembly to conclude its deliberations on the creation of a United Nations institution to advance gender equality and women's human rights. I am also in discussions with the United Nations system partners on appointing a new senior system-wide official to address sexual violence. I am considering that in the light of the General Assembly's discussions and existing mechanisms, such as the Special Rapporteur on violence against women and the Special Representative on Children and Armed Conflict. I am also studying the additional costs that this would entail.  Fourthly, we must improve monitoring, investigation and documentation to address the many challenges that we face in gathering information and reporting on sexual violence. We will also continue to promote a greater understanding of resolution 1820 (2008) in all United Nations missions and duty stations and to adapt our approaches and systems, including for 09-44842 monitoring and reporting, to support its effective implementation.  The recommendations in my report are mutually reinforcing. If they are carried out together, we can foster greater progress. Those recommendations are also designed to provide the Council with more consistent, evidence-based and timely information to help it in addressing that challenge.  Towards that end, I urge the Council to immediately authorize the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry, supported by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. It would be tasked with investigating and reporting on violations of international humanitarian and human rights law in ongoing conflict situations in Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Sudan. That independent commission of inquiry should recommend to the Council the most effective mechanisms to ensure accountability for those egregious crimes.  I also draw the Council's attention to the brutal, predatory and deliberate targeting of civilians by the Lord's Resistance Army, whose activities have destabilized civilians in the Sudan, the Central African Republic, Uganda and the Democratic People's Republic of the Congo.  I am prepared to submit an annual report on resolution 1820 (2008). I want to help ensure that all parties respect their obligations under international law and are held accountable when they violate them. Victims of sexual violence are among the world's most vulnerable and traumatized people. For the sake of these innocent women and men, their families and their societies, we must come together and act. That will help victims in war-torn countries and set us on a course for a better world.

UNSC_2010_SPV.6396_spch002.txt,2010,6396,"The Secretary-General: One of the most difficult and important tasks facing the United Nations is to ensure that nations emerging from devastating conflicts are not allowed to slide back into violence. Building peace may sound straightforward, but we know from painful experience that it is not. Success requires patience, long-term commitment and the involvement of a wide range of actors working together. We face real difficulties every day as our field missions, funds, programmes and agencies, each in their own way, work to provide the kind of help that nations need to rebuild after war. We feel keenly and constantly the need to do better.  It was in that spirit that my report last year on peacebuilding in the immediate aftermath of conflict (S/2009/304) set out an agenda for action to help the United Nations deliver more rapid and effective support to national peacebuilding efforts and to ensure that the impacts of those activities would endure.  We are making progress in Burundi, Haiti, Nepal, Sierra Leone and elsewhere. Let us remember that for people who have suffered through conflict, progress cannot come fast enough. The ultimate test is how well 10-57830 we deliver on the ground and how well we give people signs of hope, beyond mere words and promises.  One year since I issued that report, I am pleased to report that we have made real gains in carrying forward the specific recommendations I put forward aimed at better organizing our peacebuilding efforts. But we still have further to go. I see four areas that require our particular attention.  First, we need to get the right people in the right place at the right time. We now deploy special representatives and other United Nations leaders more rapidly to crisis situations. All senior staff now have managerial compacts to define their goals and priorities and to improve their accountability.  The demands on leaders in crisis situations are growing. They are now expected to implement broader Security Council mandates, provide a strategic vision, ensure proper coordination and undertake joint planning. We need to give them the properly trained and equipped support teams that will enable them to perform the full range of their responsibilities right from the very beginning.  Such demands underpin the review of international civilian capacities that is currently under way. The review is anchored in the need to ensure that international assistance in the aftermath of conflict is driven by national needs and priorities, that we make better use of the capacities of women and the global South, and that our responses become faster and more flexible. I look forward to the recommendations of the Senior Advisory Group for the Review of International Civilian Capacities, led by Jean-Marie Guehenno, early next year. Meanwhile, I encourage all Member States to be engaged in and contribute to the outcome of the review.  Secondly, we need predictable financing. Whatever type of United Nations presence there is, we and our national partners need sufficient and timely funding, especially in the middle of a crisis response. In fragile transition situations, the Peacebuilding Fund can quickly finance early action, which can in turn prompt other sources to provide longer-term funding. The Fund has streamlined its procedures, enabling it to respond more swiftly to urgent needs. I encourage Member States to contribute to its replenishment.  But the Fund is only one among many. Many other efforts are under way, aimed at making all 10-57830 peacebuilding financing more flexible and tolerant of risk. I urge Member States to support these as well.  Thirdly, we need more effective partnerships. Greater cooperation and joint approaches within the United Nations are important, but they are not enough. We must build deeper strategic partnerships. With that in mind, we have begun strengthening cooperation and developing closer institutional links with the World Bank.  Partnerships work best when roles are clear. Greater clarity and deeper capacities are being established in core areas such as mine action, mediation and electoral assistance, but we still need to review the institutional arrangement in areas such as security sector reform and the rule of law. To this end, I am encouraging a frank examination of the comparative advantages of various United Nations actors and other partners, based on available capacities and presence. This will be an important priority in the coming months, and I rely on the support of the Council.  One of the most important partnerships is the one between the Security Council and the Peacebuilding Commission. A closer collaboration can help the Council to support peacebuilding more effectively from the very start, including by enabling peacekeeping operations to have an impact as early peacebuilders and by ensuring that integrated peacebuilding offices institutionalize these early achievements.  With respect to the recent review of our peacebuilding architecture, I look forward to the outcome of discussions by the Council and the General Assembly.  Fourthly, we need to put women at the heart of peacebuilding. That is where women should be, not only because of their peacebuilding needs, but above all because of their capacities. Yet we have not truly achieved this, nor have we fully implemented resolution 1325 (2000). While their voices are critical for ensuring that the foundations of peace are just and equitable, women are still not systematically included at all stages of the peace process.  My new report on women's participation in peacebuilding (S/20lO/466) provides a comprehensive strategy to address these challenges. It identifies the hurdles women confront in seven key areas: mediation, 3 post-conflict planning, financing, civilian capacity, post-conflict governance, the rule of law and economic recovery. It makes specific commitments for each, thereby providing a framework for the full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  But that did not happen without dedicated funding for women's needs. Conflicts leave States severely weakened and social structures decimated. In such situations, women are vital to ensuring that the basic survival needs of families and communities are met. I have therefore stipulated that all peacebuilding funds managed by the United Nations will henceforth allocate 15 per cent of their funds to projects that address women's specific needs, advance gender equality or empower women. Advancing the cause of women and peace and security enhances the legitimacy of peace processes and governance structures. It must be an integral part of our peacebuilding efforts, not an afterthought.  The work of rebuilding societies broken by conflict requires long-term commitment, a truly integrated approach and significant amounts of human, financial and institutional resources. There is no set sequence of peacemaking, followed by peacekeeping, followed by peacebuilding, but rather a need for us to be flexible and bring our tools into play at the appropriate moments.  It is essential for us to develop the peacebuilding architecture and promote greater coherence within the United Nations system. Meeting these challenges will bring us closer to our overarching goal of building sustainable peace. I will continue to rely on the Council's support and cooperation in that endeavour.  ",The Secretary-General,,English,u," One of the most difficult and important tasks facing the United Nations is to ensure that nations emerging from devastating conflicts are not allowed to slide back into violence. Building peace may sound straightforward, but we know from painful experience that it is not. Success requires patience, long-term commitment and the involvement of a wide range of actors working together. We face real difficulties every day as our field missions, funds, programmes and agencies, each in their own way, work to provide the kind of help that nations need to rebuild after war. We feel keenly and constantly the need to do better.  It was in that spirit that my report last year on peacebuilding in the immediate aftermath of conflict (S/2009/304) set out an agenda for action to help the United Nations deliver more rapid and effective support to national peacebuilding efforts and to ensure that the impacts of those activities would endure.  We are making progress in Burundi, Haiti, Nepal, Sierra Leone and elsewhere. Let us remember that for people who have suffered through conflict, progress cannot come fast enough. The ultimate test is how well 10-57830 we deliver on the ground and how well we give people signs of hope, beyond mere words and promises.  One year since I issued that report, I am pleased to report that we have made real gains in carrying forward the specific recommendations I put forward aimed at better organizing our peacebuilding efforts. But we still have further to go. I see four areas that require our particular attention.  First, we need to get the right people in the right place at the right time. We now deploy special representatives and other United Nations leaders more rapidly to crisis situations. All senior staff now have managerial compacts to define their goals and priorities and to improve their accountability.  The demands on leaders in crisis situations are growing. They are now expected to implement broader Security Council mandates, provide a strategic vision, ensure proper coordination and undertake joint planning. We need to give them the properly trained and equipped support teams that will enable them to perform the full range of their responsibilities right from the very beginning.  Such demands underpin the review of international civilian capacities that is currently under way. The review is anchored in the need to ensure that international assistance in the aftermath of conflict is driven by national needs and priorities, that we make better use of the capacities of women and the global South, and that our responses become faster and more flexible. I look forward to the recommendations of the Senior Advisory Group for the Review of International Civilian Capacities, led by Jean-Marie Guehenno, early next year. Meanwhile, I encourage all Member States to be engaged in and contribute to the outcome of the review.  Secondly, we need predictable financing. Whatever type of United Nations presence there is, we and our national partners need sufficient and timely funding, especially in the middle of a crisis response. In fragile transition situations, the Peacebuilding Fund can quickly finance early action, which can in turn prompt other sources to provide longer-term funding. The Fund has streamlined its procedures, enabling it to respond more swiftly to urgent needs. I encourage Member States to contribute to its replenishment.  But the Fund is only one among many. Many other efforts are under way, aimed at making all 10-57830 peacebuilding financing more flexible and tolerant of risk. I urge Member States to support these as well.  Thirdly, we need more effective partnerships. Greater cooperation and joint approaches within the United Nations are important, but they are not enough. We must build deeper strategic partnerships. With that in mind, we have begun strengthening cooperation and developing closer institutional links with the World Bank.  Partnerships work best when roles are clear. Greater clarity and deeper capacities are being established in core areas such as mine action, mediation and electoral assistance, but we still need to review the institutional arrangement in areas such as security sector reform and the rule of law. To this end, I am encouraging a frank examination of the comparative advantages of various United Nations actors and other partners, based on available capacities and presence. This will be an important priority in the coming months, and I rely on the support of the Council.  One of the most important partnerships is the one between the Security Council and the Peacebuilding Commission. A closer collaboration can help the Council to support peacebuilding more effectively from the very start, including by enabling peacekeeping operations to have an impact as early peacebuilders and by ensuring that integrated peacebuilding offices institutionalize these early achievements.  With respect to the recent review of our peacebuilding architecture, I look forward to the outcome of discussions by the Council and the General Assembly.  Fourthly, we need to put women at the heart of peacebuilding. That is where women should be, not only because of their peacebuilding needs, but above all because of their capacities. Yet we have not truly achieved this, nor have we fully implemented resolution 1325 (2000). While their voices are critical for ensuring that the foundations of peace are just and equitable, women are still not systematically included at all stages of the peace process.  My new report on women's participation in peacebuilding (S/20lO/466) provides a comprehensive strategy to address these challenges. It identifies the hurdles women confront in seven key areas: mediation, 3 post-conflict planning, financing, civilian capacity, post-conflict governance, the rule of law and economic recovery. It makes specific commitments for each, thereby providing a framework for the full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  But that did not happen without dedicated funding for women's needs. Conflicts leave States severely weakened and social structures decimated. In such situations, women are vital to ensuring that the basic survival needs of families and communities are met. I have therefore stipulated that all peacebuilding funds managed by the United Nations will henceforth allocate 15 per cent of their funds to projects that address women's specific needs, advance gender equality or empower women. Advancing the cause of women and peace and security enhances the legitimacy of peace processes and governance structures. It must be an integral part of our peacebuilding efforts, not an afterthought.  The work of rebuilding societies broken by conflict requires long-term commitment, a truly integrated approach and significant amounts of human, financial and institutional resources. There is no set sequence of peacemaking, followed by peacekeeping, followed by peacebuilding, but rather a need for us to be flexible and bring our tools into play at the appropriate moments.  It is essential for us to develop the peacebuilding architecture and promote greater coherence within the United Nations system. Meeting these challenges will bring us closer to our overarching goal of building sustainable peace. I will continue to rely on the Council's support and cooperation in that endeavour.  "

I have asked the Deputy Secretary-General to represent me today.  The landmark adoption 10 years ago of resolution 1325 (2000) acknowledged the role of women in peace and security, not simply as victims but as agents of change. It opened the way for incorporating gender perspectives into all our work to restore, keep and build peace.  The Council has also shown its commitment by following up with three subsequent resolutions and by demanding country-specific reporting on how resolution 1325 (2000) is being implemented. Just two weeks ago, the Council received my report on women's participation in peacebuilding (S/2010/466), which details a clear seven-point agenda for action. Member States, the United Nations system and civil society have all contributed to implementing resolution 1325 (2000). Twenty countries have adopted national action plans, and women are an increasing influence in national parliaments, including in countries emerging from armed conflict. The proportion of female legislators in Burundi and Rwanda is truly inspiring.  Yet the past decade has also been marred by repeated instances of abuse. Many of my reports to the Security Council on the progress of peacekeeping missions have noted widespread rape, physical abuse, extortion and other violations of the rights and physical security of women and children during and after conflict. The recent horrifying mass rapes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were just the latest reminder of the challenges we face and of the vital importance of fully implementing resolution 1325 (2000).  As my current report (S/2010/498) indicates, progress is difficult to quantify. We lack adequate methods for monitoring our impact. That is why I call on the Council to endorse the comprehensive set of indicators first presented in April (see S/2010/173) and refined since then. The indicators will enable us to identify progress and provide the Council with systematic comparable information for effective monitoring and accountability. As Member States and civil society representatives have repeatedly stated, this comprehensive set of indicators is among the most constructive additions to the 1325 (2000) toolkit. But of course, it is also just a beginning.  Resolution 1325 (2000) will never be implemented successfully until we end sexual violence in conflict. We must hold those responsible to account, whether the crimes are committed by State or non-State parties. I call on the Council to take appropriate steps to end impunity. We must intensify efforts to prevent brutality against women and girls. Let us recognize the important role of women in the justice and security sector and support their participation. And let us eliminate stereotypes and ensure women's meaningful participation in all stages of peace processes and decision-making.  The creation of UN Women will enable us to better assist Member States in addressing all issues of gender equality and the empowerment of women, including those related to women and peace and security. To head this effort, we are fortunate to have the dynamism and political skill of Ms. Michelle Bachelet, who will present my report to Council members today.  I am determined that the United Nations system should lead by example. That is why I have appointed 11 women Special Representatives or Deputy Special Representatives of the Secretary-General to peacekeeping operations and special political missions. It is why our heads of mission - women and men alike - held 27 open day meetings this year to consult with women's organizations and receive their insights. And it is why I will continue to push for full accountability in how our own peacekeepers conduct themselves in the field. On this, I trust that I can count on the Council's full support.  I look forward to our continued collaboration in the coming decade. I am committed to working with the Council to ensure the full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and its related resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1889 (2009).

UNSC_2010_SPV.6453_spch002.txt,2010,6453,"The Secretary-General: Thank you very much, Madam President, for convening this important meeting. I appreciate your personal attention to the problem of sexual violence, which is a top priority for me and the United Nations system.  I thank all members of the Security Council for the draft resolution to be adopted during the course of this meeting. The Council will thereby put in place a vital building block for holding perpetrators accountable. It will also send out a resounding message to those who would violate both women's bodies and the law that impunity will not be tolerated.  But let us remember that even as we take this step here, catastrophe is unfolding for communities caught in the chaos of conflicts. Armed elements are targeting civilians, raping women and men and terrorizing entire populations. Premeditated campaigns are being waged with the most sinister goals: to silence women leaders, empty areas that are filled with rich minerals but poor people, recruit others and perpetuate the cycle of abuse.  Sexual violence shatters lives, devastates countries and destroys hope. Victims who might have contributed to development are shunned. Girls who might have grown into great leaders cannot even attend school. In many places, the threat is so pervasive that women cannot cultivate land, collect water or get the fuel they need to cook and feed their families - for fear that they will be attacked in the process. Often, perpetrators seem to reserve particular cruelty for children, intentionally traumatizing boys and girls by forcing them to watch as their mothers are attacked or by attacking the children themselves.  Earlier this year, this horrific reality played out in Walikale, in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Hundreds of women were raped, as were girls, boys and men. One young girl, just five years-old, suffered such severe physical injuries that she may never fully recover. We can only imagine the psychological trauma she now endures. 10-69655  Victims may survive such attacks only to be subjected to another form of abuse. Sexual violence is one of the only crimes where the victims - and not the perpetrators - are left with stigma. This is true not only in the Democratic Republic of the Congo but in other countries around the world. Victims are shamed and marginalized. Their husbands reject them. Men and boys who are sexually attacked often suffer isolation and discrimination. Just when these individuals need support from their communities, it falls away.  Silencing the victims only benefits the perpetrators. It feeds impunity, which erodes faith in the justice system. Make no mistake: this is intentional and part of the very design of the violence. Attacks on women are attacks on peace itself. That is why we must do more to fight stigma, protect women's security and help the victims. They need services and they deserve comprehensive reparations. This is critical to recovery for individuals and justice for society.  The United Nations and the international community can support national efforts, but we cannot supplant them. I call on leaders to join me in declaring that enough is enough. We cannot permit the sexual violence that is used as a tactic of war to become a way of life. The United Nations is working in conflict areas and troubled areas around the world to protect populations and combat impunity. We have seen that determined and concerted action can yield positive results.  In Walikale, peacekeepers of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), in a joint operation with Congolese forces, arrested ""Lieutenant Colonel"" Mayele, who was allegedly responsible for commanding the mass rapes. But many perpetrators are still at large. MONUSCO and the United Nations system are helping the Democratic Republic of the Congo authorities to investigate the crimes, protect witnesses and bring perpetrators to justice. MONUSCO has also launched a targeted operation to better protect civilians in the affected areas. As a result, a number of suspected human rights abusers have been arrested and many internally displaced people able to return to their homes.  Important steps have also been taken at the international level, including the recent arrests of leaders of the Forces democratiques de liberation du Rwanda in France and Germany, and the work of the 10-69655 International Criminal Court on sexual violence crimes.  Today's draft resolution gives us sharper tools and sharper teeth in the fight against sexual violence. It gives me a mandate to list, in my reports on this question, parties who commit such acts. It challenges the United Nations system to provide better information, and it reaffirms the Council's commitment to adopting sanctions against perpetrators. I will do everything possible to ensure that the draft resolution leads to real protection for populations at risk.  My Special Representative is bringing the voices of women to the Council's deliberations. I am grateful that she has been invited to brief the Council today, and hope that she has many opportunities to do so again in the future. The Council's sustained political support for the deployment of the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and the protection of advisors in affected countries will be critical as we move ahead.  The entire United Nations system is mobilized under my campaign ""UNiTE to End Violence against Women"". We are working to change attitudes across the world. Together, the United Nations, national Governments and the international community can eliminate this menace and secure a better future for all people.

UNSC_2012_SPV.6877_spch002.txt,2012,6877,"The Deputy Secretary-General: I would like to begin with a warm expression of appreciation to both India and Guatemala, which, during their Security Council presidencies, focused our attention on the important contributions by women and women's civil society organizations to preventing and resolving armed conflict and to carrying out peacebuilding.  During a recent visit to Mali, I saw first-hand some of the acute challenges that women face in times of crisis and conflict. My time there left a deep impression on me. I promised the women leaders with Whom I met in Bamako that I would convey their message to the Council. They told me disturbing accounts ofthe abuses that women faced in the northern part of the country, which is now under extremist rule and occupation. Sexual Violence against women is widespread, and I met women who had been raped. Despite being the primary victims of a combined security, political and humanitarian crisis, they remained excluded from the various bodies that were seeking possible solutions. They urged me to make known to the outside world the need not only to ease their suffering, but also to strengthen women's participation in resolving the crisis and preparing for a better future.  As Council members well know, extremist groups have started implementing exceedingly harsh interpretations of sharia law in northern Mali. That has led to the separation of boys and girls at schools, forced marriages for young girls and targeted killing or maiming of women accused of having children out of wedlock. Women's rights are being dramatically curtailed, including their right to work, leaving them unable to sustain themselves or their families.  But women in Mali and across West Africa are strongly resilient. They have already demonstrated their ability, if they are given a chance, to bring about peace,  reconciliation and development. We must empower and assist them further.  As the case of Mali clearly underlines, armed conflict affects women and men differently, which means that women have to be part of the solution. One of the key messages of the Secretary-General's report on women and peace and security (S/2012/732) is that early and sustained engagement with women is crucial to ensuring the sustainability of peace efforts, as well as vital to deepening democracy and promoting respect for human rights. Actively engaging women must be a priority, not an afterthought.  The role of women's organizations across the world in preventing violence, resolving conflict and building the foundations for peace is well known. Our challenge is to become more systematic in supporting and scaling up such initiatives and making the necessary links to formalpeace processes. Today's debate is an opportunity to support that critical work and to address the obstacles to women's participation in conflict mediation, peace talks, national dialogues and donors' conferences. It is also critical that we accelerate progress in reaching the goals of the Secretary-General's seven-point action plan on gender-responsive peacebuilding.  The Secretary-General and I welcome the presidential statement on women, peace and security issued on 31 October (S/PRST/2012/23), in which the Council pledged to advance women's participation in all aspects of conflict resolution, including transitional justice.  The United Nations system is strongly committed to strengthening the rule of law, particularly with regard to women's access to justice during and after conflict, which is precisely when it is most needed but is least accessible. We are reviewing the United Nations programming in order to galvanize a stronger and more effective impact in that area. The declaration adopted at the High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law at the National and International Levels (General Assembly resolution 67/1) has given new impetus to that effort.  Through the evolution of the women and peace and security agenda over the past 12 years and through country-specific decisions and mission mandates, the Security Council has demonstrated that decisions made around this table can tangibly improve the lives of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict situations. We must, however, ensure that those issues  are not addressedjust once a year, on the anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000). I therefore welcome the renewal of the Council's invitation to the Executive Director of UN-Women to provide periodic briefings outside the annual open debate cycle.  Finally, engaging women and promoting gender equality as part of our work for peace and security is a daily responsibility and an unfinished mission for all of us. It is time for us to finally recognize the role and power of women to help us build a peaceful world.  ",The Deputy Secretary-General,,English,u," I would like to begin with a warm expression of appreciation to both India and Guatemala, which, during their Security Council presidencies, focused our attention on the important contributions by women and women's civil society organizations to preventing and resolving armed conflict and to carrying out peacebuilding.  During a recent visit to Mali, I saw first-hand some of the acute challenges that women face in times of crisis and conflict. My time there left a deep impression on me. I promised the women leaders with Whom I met in Bamako that I would convey their message to the Council. They told me disturbing accounts ofthe abuses that women faced in the northern part of the country, which is now under extremist rule and occupation. Sexual Violence against women is widespread, and I met women who had been raped. Despite being the primary victims of a combined security, political and humanitarian crisis, they remained excluded from the various bodies that were seeking possible solutions. They urged me to make known to the outside world the need not only to ease their suffering, but also to strengthen women's participation in resolving the crisis and preparing for a better future.  As Council members well know, extremist groups have started implementing exceedingly harsh interpretations of sharia law in northern Mali.

UNSC_2013_SPV.6948_spch002.txt,2013,6948,"The Secretary-General: Thank you very much, Madam President, for convening this important meeting on conflict-related sexual violence, an issue of grave importance to the innumerable civilians who have been affected, to all of us around the table and to the entire United Nations system. I welcome Rwanda's initiative and your presence here today. I also thank the Security Council for its recognition of this matter as a serious concern for international peace and security. Wartime rape not only destroys individual lives, it lays waste to families and communities. It is also an impediment to reconciliation and sustainable development. Thanks to the Council, the world now has a solid framework for preventing and addressing conflict-related sexual violence. Resolutions 1325 (2000), 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010) help guide the work of United Nations agencies, Member States and other stakeholders. My dynamic and persuasive Special Representative on this issue carries out global advocacy.  Other important actors and tools include the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict, the women protection advisers and the monitoring, analysis and reporting arrangements. The report now before the Council (S/2013/149) reflects the progressive improvement of analysis and data over the past few years, which is a direct result of greater awareness on the ground and the strengthened capacities of missions to monitor, investigate and respond.  As we learn more about sexual violence used as a tactic of war, certain patterns are becoming clear. One is that the negative effects of wartime rape persist long after the guns fall silent. From the Balkans to Africa, United Nations entities and others continue to provide vital medical and psychosocial support to victims and survivors. Another pattern we see is that, although this Vicious crime disproportionately affects women and girls, men and boys are also targeted.  My Special Representative has also noted other emerging trends, including the link between conflict- related sexual violence and the illegal exploitation of natural resources; the impact of sexual violence on displacement; and the importance of addressing sexual violence during ceasefire negotiations, wider peace processes and security-sector reform efforts. Building on the work of her predecessor and of the 13-entity United Nations Action against Sexual Violence network, which she chairs, my Special Representative has continued to fight impunity for conflict-related sexual violence. Ms. Bangura has stressed prosecution as a means of prevention. But she has also emphasized the importance of national ownership and leadership, which I fully support.  The prosecution support cells in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, created by the Government with the support of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, are a positive example of combining the two approaches. Other peacekeeping operations intend to carry out similar projects. The Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region also represents an opportunity to address the root causes of conflict- related sexual violence.  Ultimately, however, we must strengthen our collective efforts to prevent sexual violence in the first place.  Our peacekeeping missions in the Sudan, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, together with United Nations country teams, are working to establish monitoring, analysis and reporting arrangements. That is a priority that I hope we can accomplish before the end of the year.  Together with tools such as the updated human rights database of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the protection monitoring project of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other information systems, we will be better placed to systematically identify trends and patterns, and thereby become better at preventing these crimes.  The sustainability of that work requires funding. We have now deployed eight women protection advisers in South Sudan, where the United Nations Mission in South Sudan is the first peace mission to budget for and appoint such advisers. We are also recruiting advisers for our missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire and the Central African Republic. I call on Member States to provide adequate resources for the deployment of additional advisers in those and other situations of concern. We must make this a regular feature of planning and budgeting.  I would also like to call for sustained funding for the Team of Experts that works to strengthen the capacity of national rule of law and justice actors. The Team has worked with the authorities in Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Liberia and South Sudan, and could do even more with the necessary backing.  Preventing sexual violence is first and foremost a responsibility of States, in particular of security forces, which are often the perpetrators of that grave human rights violation. But prevention is also a collective responsibility. To succeed, we must use all the tools at our disposal. That includes our peacekeeping and political missions, our mediation efforts and our efforts to protect human rights and deliver humanitarian assistance. It also encompasses the work of all those involved in building peace in the aftermath of conflict - from restoring the rule of law and advancing gender equality to promoting early recovery and longer-term development. As we deepen that effort, I look forward to the Council's sustained leadership and support.

UNSC_2013_SPV.6984_spch002.txt,2013,6984,"The Secretary-General: I thank you, Foreign Secretary Hague, for presiding over this meeting during the United Kingdom's presidency of the Security Council. I commend the leadership and efforts of the United Kingdom in bringing key international support and momentum to the crucial fight against conflict- related sexual violence.  I also welcome the tireless work and advocacy of Ms. Angelina Jolie. For years, she has been a voice for the millions of people who are forced to flee their homes due to conflict, and now for the many survivors of wartime rape whose bodies have been used as battlegrounds.  I am pleased, too, that we are joined by Jane Adong Anywar, a lawyer and civil society activist who works to bring justice to victims of sexual violence in conflict. It is through the efforts of people like Ms. Anywar that we can end impunity for this crime and ensure that survivors get the legal redress they deserve.  Last month, I briefed the Council on my visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Council will recall that I visited the Heal Africa hospital in Goma, where I met women and girls who had been raped and maimed by armed groups on all sides of the conflict. Many had a condition called traumatic fistula. In plain terms, they had been torn inside. Experiencing great pain and often unable to control bladder and bowels, they are disabled and often shunned by society. Hospitals such as Heal Africa in Goma, and Panzi in Bukavu help rehabilitate such women. They mend their wounds and provide skills that can give them self- worth and a source of income; but they cannot protect them. That is a job for the Congolese authorities and the international community, in particular the Council. As we drove into the hospital the streets were lined with women. They were angry and they had a clear message: no more impunity; no more war; give us peace. They want us to hear and act on their appeal.  Sexual Violence occurs wherever conflict rages. It has devastating effects on survivors and destroys the social fabric of whole communities. While women and girls suffer disproportionately from these vicious crimes, men and boys are also targeted. Sexual violence is a crime under international human rights law and a threat to international peace and security. When used as a weapon of war, it can significantly exacerbate conflict and seriously hamper reconciliation.  The international community, through resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010), has put in place a solid framework for responding to conflict- related sexual violence. The mechanisms established enable us to carry out global advocacy through my Special Representative, in collaboration with the United Nations Action Network against Sexual Violence in Conflict, which she leads. Today's draft resolution sends yet another strong signal to perpetrators that their acts will no longer be tolerated. They will be held accountable.  Preventing sexual Violence in conflict is our joint responsibility. It must be part of our work in many areas, from peacekeeping and political missions to mediation, ceasefire agreements, security sector reform, justice  sector reform and the delivery of humanitarian assistance. The United Nations system is committed to ""Delivering as One"", to end the culture of impunity that prevails in relation to sexual violence. On behalf of the Action Network, UN-Women and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations have developed the first-ever scenario-based training programme for peacekeepers. A senior women's protection adviser will be deployed shortly within the United Nations Mission in the Republic of South Sudan to join those already in place, while others are soon to be deployed in the Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali and Somalia.  The Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict is an important tool for strengthening national justice systems and legal frameworks. It has provided technical advice to authorities in the Central African Republic, Colombia, Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Liberia, Somalia and South Sudan.UNICEF and the United Nations Population Fund are leading the United Nations system in coordinating the provision of services for survivors. And the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and UN-Women are providing expertise for investigating and documenting gender-based violence.  Along with leadership and access to justice, understanding the extent of the problem is essential for effectively protecting women and girls.  I have consistently emphasized the importance of national ownership in preventing sexual Violence. I call on all leaders at the highest political level to voice their unequivocal support for our cause and to follow up with deeds. That includes apprehending and prosecuting perpetrators to deter further crimes. It means helping survivors by improving medical, psychological, social and judicial assistance. And it entails providing the necessary resources to support the work of my Special Representative and other mechanisms.  Those who hold power and influence have a special duty to step forward and be part of a global coalition of champions determined to break this evil. Sexual violence is a vile, whenever and wherever it occurs. It must be exposed and met with the anger and action that it deserves.  I count on the Council's sustained leadership to ensure that perpetrators are held accountable and survivors receive justice and support.

UNSC_2013_SPV.7044_spch002.txt,2013,7044,"The Secretary-General: I thank the Government of Azerbaijan for organizing this debate on the theme of women, the rule of law and transitional justice. I commend the Security Council for having adopted resolution 2122 (2013) today, underscoring the central importance of women's participation in conflict prevention, conflict resolution and peacebuilding. I welcome the call for concrete actions not only to increase the number of women in peacemaking but also, crucially, to improve the way gender issues are addressed by peace and security institutions, including the Council itself. These priorities are also featured in my seven-point action plan on gender-responsive peacebuilding.  The rule of law, women's access to transitional justice and women's participation are deeply connected. Women must be involved at every stage of efforts to reassert the rule of law and rebuild societies through transitional justice. Their needs for security and justice must be addressed. Their voices must be heard. Their rights must be protected.  I urge the Council to deal with the full range of women's rights violations that occur during conflicts. The mandates of political and peacekeeping missions should support national prosecutions for serious international crimes against women, and special measures should be taken to provide women with opportunities to engage in the design and delivery of transitional justice. Gender-responsive transitional justice measures can also help to redress historic gender-based injustices and combat the security threats and other obstacles that often restrict women's full engagement in public life.  The United Nations is developing good practices to embed gender dimensions in transitional justice and peacebuilding. We are working to ensure that women are represented on all United Nations mediation support teams. All United Nations-led or co-led peace processes are reaching out to women's civil society organizations. Our United Nations Global Focal Point on Police, Justice and Corrections is integrating gender perspectives into all aspects of our rule of law activities. We have significantly increased the percentage of female police peacekeepers and are helping local security sectors tackle sexual and gender-based violence. We have also completed a study on ways to enhance women's access to justice in conflict-affected settings.  Human rights mechanisms are also critical. I am pleased that the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women is advancing a new general recommendation on women in conflict prevention, conflict and post-conflict situations.  Notwithstanding these advances, the fact remains that while we have seen a slow but steady increase in women leaders in business and politics, this progress has not been matched around the peace table. Gains in the representation of women are often achieved through the use of temporary special measures, including quotas. Similar special measures could help to increase the number of women at all levels of mediation, peacekeeping and peacebuilding.  I am pleased that my report (S/2013/525) will be introduced today by Ms. Mlambo-Ngcuka, Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director of UN Women. This is her first such appearance before the Security Council. My report this year notes progress, but also calls for a more determined global effort to improve the protection of women and girls and enhance women's participation and leadership.  I have sought to lead by example by appointing more women to senior positions throughout the United Nations. For the first time in history, five United Nations peacekeeping operations - in South Sudan, Liberia, Cyprus, Haiti and Cote d'Ivoire - are led by women. Last year, Ms. Aichatou Souleymane - who now heads our efforts in Cote d'Ivoire - served as acting Joint Chief Mediator in Darfur. This year, I appointed Mary Robinson, my Special Envoy to the Great Lakes Region of Africa, as the United Nations first woman lead mediator in a peace process. We have more distance to travel, but we have never been this far before. Women's participation in peace efforts is a matter of gender equality and universal human rights, and crucial to achieving sustainable peace, economic recovery, social cohesion and political legitimacy. Today's resolution makes that point loud and clear.  Societies emerging from conflict face a wealth of challenges unique to their circumstances, but all encounter a crucial moment at which they can begin again, draw lessons from the upheaval and gain a new path of stability and progress. Transitional justice, with its various mechanisms to promote reconciliation, redress and compensation, has proven to play a critical role. But the success of such processes depends fundamentally on their inclusiveness and the involvement of women, of minorities, of aggrieved parties, and of all stakeholders.  The year 2015 will mark the fifteenth anniversary ofthe adoption resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security. The Council has called for a high-level review meeting to mark that occasion. I am confident that with the Council's continued support, we can achieve concrete results and measurable change in the lives of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict settings.  ",The Secretary-General,,English,u," I thank the Government of Azerbaijan for organizing this debate on the theme of women, the rule of law and transitional justice.

Last year, Ms. Aichatou Souleymane - who now heads our efforts in Cote d'Ivoire - served as acting Joint Chief Mediator in Darfur. This year, I appointed Mary Robinson, my Special Envoy to the Great Lakes Region of Africa, as the United Nations first woman lead mediator in a peace process. We have more distance to travel, but we have never been this far before. Women's participation in peace efforts is a matter of gender equality and universal human rights, and crucial to achieving sustainable peace, economic recovery, social cohesion and political legitimacy. Today's resolution makes that point loud and clear.  Societies emerging from conflict face a wealth of challenges unique to their circumstances, but all encounter a crucial moment at which they can begin again, draw lessons from the upheaval and gain a new path of stability and progress. Transitional justice, with its various mechanisms to promote reconciliation, redress and compensation, has proven to play a critical role. But the success of such processes depends fundamentally on their inclusiveness and the involvement of women, of minorities, of aggrieved parties, and of all stakeholders.  The year 2015 will mark the fifteenth anniversary ofthe adoption resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security. The Council has called for a high-level review meeting to mark that occasion. I am confident that with the Council's continued support, we can achieve concrete results and measurable change in the lives of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict settings.  "
UNSC_2014_SPV.7160_spch002.txt,2014,7160,"The Secretary-General: I thank Nigeria for convening this important debate.  Conflict-related sexual violence is an issue of pressing importance. This grave human rights abuse is as destructive as any bomb or bullet. It inflicts unimaginable suffering on women and men, girls and boys. It destroys families and communities and tears the social fabric of nations. By targeting society's most vulnerable members, it contributes to enduring poverty and insecurity. It impedes reconciliation, peace and reconstruction.  That is why the Council has clearly and consistently stated that conflict-related sexual Violence is a matter of international peace and security. Successive resolutions have created a strong global framework for prevention. Grievous violations still occur too often, but we are beginning to make tangible progress, as the report before the Council (S/20l4/l8l) shows.  My Special Representative has examined the progress made by several countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia. Just a few years ago, rape in these conflicts seemed intractable and inevitable. The Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia are now demonstrating that progress is possible. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is developing new legal structures to end impunity for perpetrators. Somalia has shown commitment at the highest level to ending sexual violence, including by signing a joint communique with the United Nations. Efforts are now under way to develop an action plan.  The United Nations Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict is working with Colombia, C6te d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Somalia and South Sudan to strengthen their justice systems. Every day, more countries are building the technical capacity to prevent and redress sexual violence. The multidisciplinary and multisectoral approach of the Office of the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict is driving this progress. The Special Representative engages in high-level advocacy to generate national ownership, leadership and responsibility.  Once political commitment has been secured, the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict works with countries to build their capacity to fight impunity for crimes of sexual violence. The Team is drawn from the United Nations Development Programme, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and led by the Office of my Special Representative. It helps Governments to address reforms to the military and criminal justice systems and other crucial areas. With sound legislation, comprehensive prevention and response mechanisms, and enhanced capacity, military and civilian justice systems will be better able to address conflict-related sexual Violence promptly and effectively.  Another key element in political and peacekeeping missions has been the deployment of women protection advisers. Their expertise on human rights, gender analysis and peace and security is helping to mainstream the prevention of conflict-related sexual violence into peacekeeping and special political missions. In line with the principle of ""Delivering as one"", United Nations Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict is an inter-agency network of 13 United Nations entities, chaired by my Special Representative. This coordination mechanism ensures that our response avoids duplication, leading to a measured, sustainable and coherent strategy that makes the best use of limited resources and the strengths of each agency. The goal is to provide services and support for victims and ensure that human rights are at the forefront of all interventions.  This coordinated response, under the leadership of my Special Representative, embodies the spirit of the ""Rights up front"" initiative. It affirms my vision of a United Nations that works as one to prevent grave human rights violations. It is imperative that United Nations actors and political leaders work together to stop rights abuses before they happen. The renewed commitment of the United Nations to better meeting the human rights responsibilities set by Member States through the ""Rights up front"" initiative is central in this regard. My latest report illustrates what we can achieve through greater cooperation. Prevention is our collective responsibility. Only through coordination and partnership can we succeed in protecting the most vulnerable.

I am personally committed to implementing those resolutions. I have highlighted women's leadership in peacebuilding as a priority. I have appointed five women Who are now serving as my Special Representatives in peacekeeping missions from Haiti to Cote d'Ivoire, from the Western Sahara and South Sudan to Cyprus.

On the tenth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), I suggested that the Council convene a ministerial-level review every five years to assess progress, renew commitments and address obstacles. I thank Member States for having come forward today to share their achievements. I look forward to hearing their plans for even stronger action.  This year we have conducted three major reviews of United Nations peace operations, our peacebuilding architecture, and women and peace and security. One common theme has emerged: any reforms must include gender equality and women's leadership as central ingredients and must be strongly grounded in human rights.  We must also pay particular attention to those women who are most vulnerable. Facing a compound disadvantage of gender and ethnicity, indigenous women suffer from multiple forms of discrimination, especially in times of conflict. We must also do much more to combat the growing spread of violent extremism. Groups such as Daesh and Boko Haram have mercilessly targeted women and girls. For example, the systematic acts carried out by Daesh against the Yazidi community, which include killings, torture, rape and sexual slavery, may amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. We must ensure accountability.  As we look ahead, we have an ambitious agenda. The Department of Peacekeeping Operations is restructuring the gender architecture at Headquarters and in field missions, strengthening the partnership with UN-Women and improving the accountability of senior managers.  The Department of Political Affairs has highlighted the need to deploy gender advisers to all special political missions. It is working to bolster the capacity of its gender team at Headquarters and to keep expanding the engagement and participation of women in peacemaking.  The Department of Field Support is implementing strengthened measures to address sexual exploitation and abuse, and to increase the representation of women in peacekeeping, especially at the senior management level. With my appointment of a Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, we have seen strategic leadership and unprecedented advances on this critical aspect of the women and peace and security agenda. We must ensure that these gains are reinforced, particularly the concerted focus on prevention, accountability and the critical needs of survivors of sexual violence.  The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs will ensure that the outcomes and commitments of the upcoming World Humanitarian Summit, to be held in Istanbul in May, have a strong focus on gender equality. We will also boost efforts to ensure that women and girls affected by crises are systematically prioritized in the planning and implementation of humanitarian responses.  I personally commit to do all I can to ensure that we reach the target of devoting 15 per cent of peacebuilding funds to projects that address gender equality and the empowerment of women. We must also expand this target to our efforts in emerging areas of peace and security threats, in particular the countering of violent extremism.

UNSC_2015_SPV.7585_spch002.txt,2015,7585,"The Deputy Secretary-General: I welcome the Security Council's focus on the practice of human trafficking in situations of conflict and displacement.  Let us first be clear on what we are discussing today: human trafficking is slavery in the modern age. Slavery is not just a past abomination; millions of people are living as slaves, or in slave-like conditions, even as we speak today, in this year of 2015, here at the United Nations, with the Charter of the United Nations in front of us, here at the horseshoe table.  Most of the victims of trafficking are vulnerable women and children, deceived or abducted into a life of suffering, exploitation, torture or servitude. This ruthless practice has become a global industry, and it must be stopped. I am heartened that in September Member States committed, as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (General Assembly resolution 70/1), to Goals 5, 8 and 16, to take action on human trafficking.  There are more people displaced today than at any time since the Second World War. Millions more are caught up in conflict and unable to flee. These human beings are exposed to a wide range of human rights violations, not the least of which is trafficking. They are sold and trafficked for sexual enslavement, prostitution, illegal adoption, slave labour, purposes of criminality or recruitment as child soldiers.  The Council has heard reports on almost 20 countries engulfed in conflict, or trying to recover from conflict, where these practices are widespread. The victims are mainly women and girls, but also boys and men. Thousands of men and boys have been forcibly conscripted by the Lord's Resistance Army and other armed groups. The plight of women and girls held by groups such as Daesh and Boko Haram is, tragically, well known. The abduction of hundreds of schoolgirls from Chibok by Boko Haram captured global attention, and the memory of that incident still lingers in our minds.  Thousands of Yazidi women in Iraq have been abducted and enslaved by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. As the Secretary-General stated in his remarks to the Security Council on 13 October 2015,  ""the systematic acts carried out by Daesh against the Yazidi community, which include killings, torture, rape and sexual slavery, may amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. We must ensure accountability."" (S/PV7533, p. 3)  I very much appreciate the presence here today of Nadia Murad Basee Taha, of the Yazidi community, as a Witness to the cruel and grim realities.  Trafficking in persons is a crime and a violation of human rights and must be treated as such. The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, provides a framework for action. With 169 States parties, the Protocol is close to universal adherence. I urge all countries to ratify and fully implement it.  Resolution 2195 (2014) recognizes the linkage between organized crime, including trafficking in persons, and terrorism; I am sure that Mr. Fedotov will touch on this. I urge all States to become parties to international treaties against trafficking in persons, the smuggling of migrants and corruption and slavery, as well as treaties that protect human rights, especially the rights of women and children. We also have the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, which includes provisions on addressing  this problem in conflict settings. I already mentioned, of course, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), where this subject is also brought up.  But we need to do more. We should more robustly implement the Plan of Action and the international Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, particularly internationaln conflict settings and post-conflict reconstruction work, a subject on the Security Council's agenda. We should also support the important work of the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking in Persons. Ending human trafficking also means committing to resolve the conflicts in which human trafficking thrives.  Horrifying tales have emerged of how women and children are treated in captivity. But even when captivity ends, the suffering continues. Last month, the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, my friend and colleague Adama Dieng, met with several Yazidi victims of trafficking at the Khanke camp for internally displaced persons, near Dohuk, in northern Iraq. He asked me to convey his impressions briefly. He spoke to two girls who had managed to leave Daesh and reunite with their families. They were indeed free from Daesh, but, and he stated this very clearly, they were nor free not from fear and unbearable memories. Indeed, the scars of such violence last a lifetime. Victims fortunate enough to be freed need assistance to regain their rights and dignity and to reintegrate into society. They must be given a chance to take back their lives and build new futures. The United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Victims of Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, is there to work on their behalf. I encourage all, Member States and others, to contribute to the Fund. It is also crucially important to fight impunity by bringing traffickers to account and to justice.  In closing, human trafficking is often described as unthinkable and unspeakable. But it is our shared, serious and sincere responsibility to think deeply and speak clearly about the abuses to which innumerable and nameless victims are subjected.

UNSC_2016_SPV.7642_spch002.txt,2016,7642,"The Secretary-General: I thank you, Sir, for this opportunity to brief the Council on the important steps being taken and the measures being put in place to end the exploitation and abuse of vulnerable people by the United Nations personnel sent to protect them.  For many people caught up in poverty and conflict around the world, the United Nations represents their final hope for a better future. When sexual exploitation and abuse are perpetrated against these individuals by the United Nations personnel authorized to protect them, it further victimizes and violates them and inflicts untold harm on already fragile communities. It undermines the trust between the United Nations and its beneficiaries, betrays the values and principles that the United Nations purports to advance, and tarnishes the credibility of United Nations peacekeeping operations and the United Nations as a whole. The impact is not limited to the location of the abuse, but reflects on the efforts of tens of thousands of peacekeepers and civilian staff working tirelessly to save lives and protect people around the world in difficult and often dangerous conditions.  In June 2015, I, like the Council, was deeply dismayed by allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse of children by foreign military forces in the Central African Republic and the United Nations response to those allegations. In that context, I appointed a high- level external independent review panel on sexual exploitation and abuse by international peacekeeping forces in the Central African Republic. The panel was led by Justice Marie Deschamps, with two other eminent persons. In mid-December 2015, the Panel submitted its report, which depicted a United Nations that uncovered the abuses but failed to respond meaningfully and with the speed, care or sensitivity required.  A number of the panel's recommendations are already being implemented, while those that have far-reaching implications or that require action by legislative bodies, Member States and partners are being considered. Given the importance of addressing the systemic weaknesses that the panel's report exposes, I have appointed a Special Coordinator, Ms. Jane Holl Lute. Ms. Lute will support me in reviewing and advancing the implementation of the panel's recommendations and in strengthening our response to such abuse.  Let me turn to my latest annual report to the General Assembly on special measures on protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (A/70/729). The report shows an increase in the number of new allegations in 2015, with a total of 99 for the United Nations system. Sixty-nine of those allegations were lodged against United Nations personnel serving in peace operations. That reflects an increase in allegations within United Nations peacekeeping operations, with multiple allegations against the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) and increases in allegations from the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the United Nations Operation in Cote d'Ivoire and the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali. Further allegations have continued to come to light this year.  In the face of that disturbing trend across a number of our peacekeeping operations, it is imperative that our collective response be more effective. My report proposes strong new initiatives in three key areas: first, ending impunity; secondly, helping and supporting victims; and thirdly, strengthening accountability, including through action by Member States.  First and foremost, to end impunity, greater transparency is critical. This year for the first time, my report names the countries of alleged perpetrators. Country-specific information is publicly available on the website of the Conduct and Discipline Unit of the Department of Field Support. I intend to expand that information to cover all outstanding allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse, including the status of referrals for criminal accountability. That will hold accountable and enable the United Nations and Member States to address every allegation of sexual exploitation or abuse in a thorough and timely manner through proper investigation and just punishment.  Secondly, the victims, many of whom are children, need our protection and support. We are finalizing the establishment of a trust fund that will provide them with the medical, psychosocial and legal services that they need. I have asked Member States to approve the transfer to the trust fund of payments that will be withheld in substantiated cases of sexual exploitation and abuse. I encourage Member States to make voluntary contributions to the fund. I have also urged all troop- and police-contributing countries to designate paternity focal points. We will follow up vigorously to ensure that children who are born as a result of these terrible abuses receive the support they need. Member States must also consider how they will respond to claims from victims who pursue legal action to seek redress.  Thirdly, accountability demands the conduct of solid investigations that can withstand judicial scrutiny in disciplinary and criminal proceedings. That will require developing uniformly high standards of investigation. It will entail building the capacities of immediate response teams to gather and preserve evidence. All investigations should be concluded within six months at most, with the most urgent cases concluded within three months. I urge Member States to adopt this standard.  I also urge Member States to cooperate with the Office of Internal Oversight Services in the conduct of investigations. I am strongly committed to monitoring accountability for violations. Where appropriate, that will include taking action up to and including the repatriation of commanders or of whole contingents. We have already put that into practice in repatriating troops serving in the Central African Republic, owing to alleged sexual exploitation and abuse. When I requested the resignation of my Special Representative for MINUSCA in August 2015, I further signalled that the Organization would hold itself accountable for such violations. I will also consider ending the deployment of uniformed personnel from specific Member States if there is prima facie evidence of widespread or systemic exploitation and abuse. Accountability demands that Member States live up to their responsibility to bring to justice those who have committed crimes while serving with the United Nations. We expect them to impose sanctions commensurate with the seriousness of the offence. I have asked Member States to establish on-site court martial proceedings and to ensure that domestic legislation applies to sex crimes committed by their nationals while they are serving within United Nations peace operations. I have also called for the collection of samples of the DNA of alleged offenders.  We also continue to emphasize prevention. Significantly, this year for the first time, we will be able to vet all uniformed personnel for previous allegations of misconduct while in the service of the United Nations. We are increasing our support for predeployment training by Member States. We will also consider imposing new rules to curtail the social activities of peacekeeping contingents, including by designating certain geographical areas as out-of- bounds.  (spoke in French)  Those efforts constitute an important step forward towards ending such crimes and the terrible suffering they inflict on their victims. We can ensure the implementation of the principle of accountability, and in particular criminal accountability, only if the troop- and police-contributing countries quickly and carefully investigate such allegations and if the responsible parties are duly punished. The United Nations is firmly determined to work with Member States to ensure that national judiciary proceedings make it possible to implement the principle of accountability and to fight impunity.  (spoke in English)  This is a global issue. It is not confined to any one region, mission or nation. I am determined that the United Nations must lead by example. Sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations personnel demand nothing less than decisive and bold action. I am committed to working with Member States to confront that criminal conduct and to justify the trust of the people we serve to ensure that this Organization remains a beacon of hope for the most vulnerable.  ",The Secretary-General,,English,u," I thank you, Sir, for this opportunity to brief the Council on the important steps being taken and the measures being put in place to end the exploitation and abuse of vulnerable people by the United Nations personnel sent to protect them.  For many people caught up in poverty and conflict around the world, the United Nations represents their final hope for a better future. When sexual exploitation and abuse are perpetrated against these individuals by the United Nations personnel authorized to protect them, it further victimizes and violates them and inflicts untold harm on already fragile communities. It undermines the trust between the United Nations and its beneficiaries, betrays the values and principles that the United Nations purports to advance, and tarnishes the credibility of United Nations peacekeeping operations and the United Nations as a whole. The impact is not limited to the location of the abuse, but reflects on the efforts of tens of thousands of peacekeepers and civilian staff working tirelessly to save lives and protect people around the world in difficult and often dangerous conditions.  In June 2015, I, like the Council, was deeply dismayed by allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse of children by foreign military forces in the Central African Republic and the United Nations response to those allegations. In that context, I appointed a high- level external independent review panel on sexual exploitation and abuse by international peacekeeping forces in the Central African Republic. The panel was led by Justice Marie Deschamps, with two other eminent persons. In mid-December 2015, the Panel submitted its report, which depicted a United Nations that uncovered the abuses but failed to respond meaningfully and with the speed, care or sensitivity required.  A number of the panel's recommendations are already being implemented, while those that have far-reaching implications or that require action by legislative bodies, Member States and partners are being considered. Given the importance of addressing the systemic weaknesses that the panel's report exposes, I have appointed a Special Coordinator, Ms. Jane Holl Lute. Ms. Lute will support me in reviewing and advancing the implementation of the panel's recommendations and in strengthening our response to such abuse.  Let me turn to my latest annual report to the General Assembly on special measures on protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (A/70/729). The report shows an increase in the number of new allegations in 2015, with a total of 99 for the United Nations system. Sixty-nine of those allegations were lodged against United Nations personnel serving in peace operations. That reflects an increase in allegations within United Nations peacekeeping operations, with multiple allegations against the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) and increases in allegations from the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the United Nations Operation in Cote d'Ivoire and the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali. Further allegations have continued to come to light this year.  In the face of that disturbing trend across a number of our peacekeeping operations, it is imperative that our collective response be more effective. My report proposes strong new initiatives in three key areas: first, ending impunity; secondly, helping and supporting victims; and thirdly, strengthening accountability, including through action by Member States.  First and foremost, to end impunity, greater transparency is critical. This year for the first time, my report names the countries of alleged perpetrators. Country-specific information is publicly available on the website of the Conduct and Discipline Unit of the Department of Field Support. I intend to expand that information to cover all outstanding allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse, including the status of referrals for criminal accountability. That will hold accountable and enable the United Nations and Member States to address every allegation of sexual exploitation or abuse in a thorough and timely manner through proper investigation and just punishment.  Secondly, the victims, many of whom are children, need our protection and support. We are finalizing the establishment of a trust fund that will provide them with the medical, psychosocial and legal services that they need. I have asked Member States to approve the transfer to the trust fund of payments that will be withheld in substantiated cases of sexual exploitation and abuse. I encourage Member States to make voluntary contributions to the fund. I have also urged all troop- and police-contributing countries to designate paternity focal points. We will follow up vigorously to ensure that children who are born as a result of these terrible abuses receive the support they need. Member States must also consider how they will respond to claims from victims who pursue legal action to seek redress.  Thirdly, accountability demands the conduct of solid investigations that can withstand judicial scrutiny in disciplinary and criminal proceedings. That will require developing uniformly high standards of investigation. It will entail building the capacities of immediate response teams to gather and preserve evidence. All investigations should be concluded within six months at most, with the most urgent cases concluded within three months. I urge Member States to adopt this standard.  I also urge Member States to cooperate with the Office of Internal Oversight Services in the conduct of investigations. I am strongly committed to monitoring accountability for violations. Where appropriate, that will include taking action up to and including the repatriation of commanders or of whole contingents. We have already put that into practice in repatriating troops serving in the Central African Republic, owing to alleged sexual exploitation and abuse. When I requested the resignation of my Special Representative for MINUSCA in August 2015, I further signalled that the Organization would hold itself accountable for such violations.

UNSC_2016_SPV.7642_spch019.txt,2016,7642,"The Secretary-General: First I would like to thank the President for taking the initiative to organize a debate on this very important subject, which has a lot to do with our reputation and future work. The open discussion on this shameful issue will create a sense of urgency with regard to and raise awareness of the need to take immediate action based on the principles of accountability and transparency.  This issue has not only humbled me; it has left me feeling very regretful and ashamed as the Secretary- General of the United Nations. I am sure that the message that the Council has conveyed strongly and unambiguously will help to strengthen my commitment as well as that of the senior advisors of the United Nations engaged in this area. Again, I feel deeply sorry for the victims, in particular those minors whose human rights and dignity have been abused. I apologize for not having taken more thorough care on this matter. I thank the Council for presenting clear guidelines and directions to the Secretariat, myself and the world. The United Nations is very committed. As Ambassador Samantha Power has so eloquently, passionately and emotionally stated, this matter greatly affects our reputation. Why were we unable to address this issue much, much earlier? Only a few people are responsible for the problem. There is a saying that a small mudfish can make an otherwise clean stream dirty. We must eliminate thse practices. We must get rid of those mudfish, and I am very much committed to working with the Council on this matter. At the same time, despite the shamefulness of the issue, we must honour the integrity, sacrifice and hard work of the tens of thousands of peacekeepers and police officers who are working under very difficult and often dangerous circumstances. We have lost a lot of peacekeepers. We really have to honour them. Their reputation, integrity and honour should not be tarnished by this small number of people. I am really commiting myself on this matter.  During my term as Secretary-General, which began in 2007, the issue of ending violence against women has been one of my top priorities. Council members may remember that I launched the Unite to End Violence against Women campaign in 2008. Then, in 2009, knowing that the mentality of men must be changed, I established the Network of Men Leaders. I reached out to a great number of men leaders in Governments and the business community, and religious leaders. We have been working to eliminate these practices.  However, we see now that we have been neglecting our own in-house concerns. This has happened in-house, and we have to take greater responsibility for this matter. I appointed the first Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, and I have a Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict. And I have appointed most recently Jane Holl Lute. Appointing special representatives or responsible persons may be helpful, but I need the support of everybody - all Member States, the Secretariat, and people working in the field. We all must work together.  As I have presented in my report (A/70/729), I think this matter should be addressed comprehensively. First and foremost, we have to do much more to end this violence and help the victims. I appreciate the willingness of Member States to provide financial and other material support to a trust fund. At the same time, I am also grateful that Member States agree to my proposal to withhold the salaries of those that have committed violence and to transfer those salaries to a trust fund. That is a a small effort, but I do need the strong support of Member States.  Measures to ensure accountability should be formulated, strengthened and implemented. Without an accountability process firmly established in mindsets as well as in our system, I regret to say that we will see this kind of crime continue. In that regard, I am making sure that our investigations of currently pending cases are expedited. From 2010 through 2015, we received 407 cases of alleged abuse. Eighty per cent of them have been concluded. As ofthe end of 2015, we still had 54 cases pending. I believe that a large number ofthose 54 cases were reported in 2015. We have concluded all investigations up through 2012. We still have three cases from 2013 and three cases pending from 2014. We will make sure to expedite the investigations as much as possible. Out of 407 cases, we have concluded 353. However, 48 cases remain . I will make sure that investigations are expedited. Although I suggested a six-month investigation period, we will shorten the process further.  Once allegations have been reported or a report has been received, we will take interim measures. For example, the persons involved may be suspended from the mission or confined to the barracks, or assigned to another mission, which will then have to confine that person within the mission. And of course, salaries will be withheld as much as possible.  Now, during the course of discussions some Member States have stated - and of course I agree with them - that the honour and reputation of troop- contributing countries should be respected. We have tried to do that by not disclosing the names of countries until most recently. However, we have realized that this is not very helpful. That is why last year we returned the personnel of certain Member States, whose names have already been publicized, and established a conduct and discipline website where we are making all the names of the countries and cases available at all times to Member States and the international community.  There may always be a question about whether naming and shaming is a good policy or not at this time. Sometimes we need to make it known to the public so that they will also be motivated to improve their way of conducting their business. In that regard, as most speakers today have explained and expressed, it is extremely important for troop-contributing countries  to offer firm and strong predeployment education and training on the importance of respecting human rights, particularly gender empowerment and balance. Without the strong engagement and commitment of the Member States, it will be extremely difficult for the Secretariat to manage these cases alone.  As Secretary-General for the past many years, I have directly confronted many Heads of State, face to face, and told them: ""You cannot go on like this"". Some Heads of State have made excuses, saying that the alleged crime was not committed by their people. I am talking about national crimes of sexual violance, not United Nations-related. They say that the crimes are committed by rebels. ""But Mr. President,"" I reply, ""Are you not the leader of a sovereign State? Whoever commits these crimes within your territorial boundaries is your responsibility. You have to be accountable."" I have gone face to face in my fights with Heads of State.  I again commit myself to confronting any country that continues to permit such crimes. Particularly at the United Nations, we have to clean house; only then can I go out to Member States worldwide to eradicate sexual violence against women. That is my strong commitment, and I really count on the strong engagement and support of Member States. I truly appreciate the fact that the Security Council has raised this issue.

UNSC_2016_SPV.7704_spch002.txt,2016,7704,"The Secretary-General (spoke in French): It is a pleasure for me to join the Security Council today for this debate on sexual violence in conflict. All over the world, we are witnessing an appalling number of acts of sexual violence in wartime. No region can escape this scourge, which continues to plague women, girls, boys and men. However, an unprecedented political momentum has made it possible to make clear progress in the fight against such crimes. The international community has finally broken the silence and taboo surrounding the issue.  (Spoke in English)  Sexual violence is widely recognized as a deliberate strategy used to shred the fabric of society, to control and intimidate communities and to force people from their homes. It is rightly seen as a threat to international peace and security, a serious violation of international humanitarian law and human rights law and a major impediment to post-conflict reconciliation and economic development. The Council has played a significant role in ushering in this change, in particular through several landmark resolutions that confirm sexual violence as a war crime, a crime against humanity and a constituent act of genocide. The designation of 19 June as the International Day for the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict is a further sign of heightened engagement and commitment.  Over the past decade, I have sought to do whatever I could to end sexual violence in conflict and to uphold the rights of women and girls everywhere. I launched my UNiTE Campaign to End Violence against Women and created the post of Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict. Through the work of my Special Representative, the United Nations has agreed frameworks of cooperation and joint communiques with Governments and regional bodies. The deployment of women protection advisers to peacekeeping and political missions has strengthened the monitoring, analysis and reporting of conflict-related sexual violence and engagement with parties to conflict, which are vital steps towards accountability. The United Nations will continue our own efforts to ensure that peacekeepers uphold the highest standards of integrity towards the people they serve.  Today, we and our partners are supporting thousands of survivors whom we were not reaching a decade ago, with practical measures ranging from reporting hotlines to community-based care. Those policies not only help survivors, they enable societies to begin their own recovery.  Internationaljurisprudence has also been developed around sexual violence in conflict, leading to landmark cases against political and military leaders. The recent conviction of Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo by the International Criminal Court was the latest sign that the era of impunity for sexual violence as a tool of war is over.  The past decade has shown that progress is possible, even in the most difficult and intractable situations. However, we still face serious challenges. My latest annual report (S/2016/36l) covers 19 situations of concern and lists dozens of parties that systematically commit such crimes. One extremely disturbing aspect is the use of sexual violence as a tactic of terrorism. Da'esh, Boko Haram and other extremist groups are using sexual violence as a means of attracting and retaining fighters, and to generate revenue. It is estimated that the Yazidi community gave Da'esh up to $45 million in ransom payments in 2014 alone. Abducted women, men, girls and boys suffer the most terrible trauma through brutal physical and sexual assault, child and forced marriages and sexual slavery on a massive scale. The abduction of more than 200 girls from Chibok, Nigeria, more than two years ago, is one of the most horrific examples of the use of sexual violence as a tactic of terrorism.  I call for the immediate release of all those taken captive, and for care and support for those who return, who can suffer from social isolation and depression. Women and girls with children may need special medical and psychosocial support, which must extend to the children themselves, who can suffer complete rejection. The shame and social stigma faced by those women and children should be redirected towards the brutal perpetrators of violence.  We must continue to speak up for the women, girls, men and boys whose bodies for too long have been considered the spoils of war.

UNSC_2016_SPV.7793_spch002.txt,2016,7793,"The Secretary-General: I thank the Russian presidency of the Security Council for organizing this very important meeting to discuss women's role in peace and security.  Women have a vital role to play in preventing conflict and building and maintaining peace. But, although that is now widely recognized, far too often women are prevented from fully participating in peacemaking and peacebuilding. We are all suffering from the effects of that deficit. In our interconnected world, insecurity and conflict in one country or region affects us all.  Nine years ago, I addressed the Council during its first open debate on women and peace and security (see S/PV.5766). Since then, the United Nations has made some progress in the promotion of the women and peace and security agenda. The establishment of UN-Women amplified women's voices and created momentum for women's leadership on peace and security. The Office of my Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict is focusing international attention on one of the greatest moral challenges of our time. The Council adopted new resolutions on women and peace and security. Last year's high-level reviews of our peace operations and peacebuilding architecture, and the global study on women and peace and security, spurred new commitments and determination.  When I became Secretary-General, there were four countries with national action plans on women and peace and Security; today there are 63. Ipersonally have appointed many women as Special Envoys and Special Representatives. I also appointed the first female Force commander of a peacekeeping mission and the first female Police Adviser. Hundreds of thousands of women and girls are being helped and supported by United Nations programmes in conflict-affected countries. National and international tribunals have issued verdicts that are historic milestones for gender justice. Many countries have committed to action to prevent and address conflict-related sexual violence. Perhaps most important of all, we see more inclusive peace processes and peace agreements. The Colombian peace talks included a group dedicated to gender perspectives and women's rights. More women than ever before are making decisions for peace and security in the halls of Governments and international organizations.  I am painfully aware that, despite all those steps, the situation remains far from equitable. I am ashamed of the many atrocities that continue to be committed against women and girls, including by some of our own peacekeepers. I am angered by the continued political exclusion of women. Peace processes, humanitarian programmes and peacebuilding plans ignore them and fail to meet their needs and protect their rights. Look at the pictures of peace negotiations on Syria or Yemen. There may be one woman at the table or in one delegation. That is fully representative of the general picture. And all that is against a backdrop of women and girls suffering inequalities that are aggravated by conflict, who are targeted for particularly brutal crimes by violent extremist groups, including Da'esh and Boko Haram. As we carry this agenda forward and build on past efforts, I urge members to take several specific steps.  First, I urge the Council to seek information on women and girls in all its reports and briefings on countries affected by conflict. Without relevant information, peacekeeping mandates will never meet the needs of women and girls. Too often, what is not counted does not count.  Secondly, I urge the Council to hold all United Nations peace operations accountable for putting women and girls at the centre of their work.  Thirdly, I encourage the members of the Council to listen to civil society, and in particular to women's groups, in all their deliberations on conflict prevention and peacebuilding.  Fourthly, I urge the Council to make sure that there are funds available for those activities. The failure to fund this agenda is possibly the greatest obstacle we face to implementation. I call on members to earmark a minimum of 15 per cent of funding on peace and security to programmes that address the needs ofwomen and girls, and to make full use of the new pooled fund that was created to channel more resources to women's organizations working for peace.  And, fifthly, I encourage the Council to consider ways to make peace negotiations more diverse. After more than 15 years of advocacy, that has not happened. Clearly, new ideas and stronger action are needed.  In failing to include women and girls in peacemaking and peacebuilding processes, we are not only failing women and girls, we are failing the world. This agenda is not an optional extra, or a favour to women and girls. It is fundamental to building sustainable peace and ending the conflicts that are causing so much pain and damage around the world. There is more research emerging every year to demonstrate that. Let me remind the Council of one finding among many, namely, that peace accords are 35 per cent more likely to last at least 15 years if women are at the table.  I will never forget the strength of the thousands of women and girls whom I have met in some of the harshest places on the planet ravaged by war. I have been inspired many times by women who are working to prevent conflict and build peace, and by the sacrifice of countless women human rights defenders. I urge the Security Council to do everything possible to create the conditions for peace in our world. I will never stop, and we must never stop, in the urgent drive to bring women into their rightful place at the heart of building peace and security.  ",The Secretary-General,,English,u," I thank the Russian presidency of the Security Council for organizing this very important meeting to discuss women's role in peace and security.  Women have a vital role to play in preventing conflict and building and maintaining peace. But, although that is now widely recognized, far too often women are prevented from fully participating in peacemaking and peacebuilding. We are all suffering from the effects of that deficit. In our interconnected world, insecurity and conflict in one country or region affects us all.  Nine years ago, I addressed the Council during its first open debate on women and peace and security (see S/PV.5766). Since then, the United Nations has made some progress in the promotion of the women and peace and security agenda. The establishment of UN-Women amplified women's voices and created momentum for women's leadership on peace and security. The Office of my Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict is focusing international attention on one of the greatest moral challenges of our time. The Council adopted new resolutions on women and peace and security. Last year's high-level reviews of our peace operations and peacebuilding architecture, and the global study on women and peace and security, spurred new commitments and determination.  When I became Secretary-General, there were four countries with national action plans on women and peace and Security; today there are 63. Ipersonally have appointed many women as Special Envoys and Special Representatives. I also appointed the first female Force commander of a peacekeeping mission and the first female Police Adviser. Hundreds of thousands of women and girls are being helped and supported by United Nations programmes in conflict-affected countries. National and international tribunals have issued verdicts that are historic milestones for gender justice. Many countries have committed to action to prevent and address conflict-related sexual violence. Perhaps most important of all, we see more inclusive peace processes and peace agreements. The Colombian peace talks included a group dedicated to gender perspectives and women's rights. More women than ever before are making decisions for peace and security in the halls of Governments and international organizations.  I am painfully aware that, despite all those steps, the situation remains far from equitable. I am ashamed of the many atrocities that continue to be committed against women and girls, including by some of our own peacekeepers. I am angered by the continued political exclusion of women. Peace processes, humanitarian programmes and peacebuilding plans ignore them and fail to meet their needs and protect their rights. Look at the pictures of peace negotiations on Syria or Yemen. There may be one woman at the table or in one delegation. That is fully representative of the general picture. And all that is against a backdrop of women and girls suffering inequalities that are aggravated by conflict, who are targeted for particularly brutal crimes by violent extremist groups, including Da'esh and Boko Haram. As we carry this agenda forward and build on past efforts, I urge members to take several specific steps.  First, I urge the Council to seek information on women and girls in all its reports and briefings on countries affected by conflict. Without relevant information, peacekeeping mandates will never meet the needs of women and girls. Too often, what is not counted does not count.  Secondly, I urge the Council to hold all United Nations peace operations accountable for putting women and girls at the centre of their work.  Thirdly, I encourage the members of the Council to listen to civil society, and in particular to women's groups, in all their deliberations on conflict prevention and peacebuilding.  Fourthly, I urge the Council to make sure that there are funds available for those activities. The failure to fund this agenda is possibly the greatest obstacle we face to implementation. I call on members to earmark a minimum of 15 per cent of funding on peace and security to programmes that address the needs ofwomen and girls, and to make full use of the new pooled fund that was created to channel more resources to women's organizations working for peace.  And, fifthly, I encourage the Council to consider ways to make peace negotiations more diverse. After more than 15 years of advocacy, that has not happened. Clearly, new ideas and stronger action are needed.  In failing to include women and girls in peacemaking and peacebuilding processes, we are not only failing women and girls, we are failing the world. This agenda is not an optional extra, or a favour to women and girls. It is fundamental to building sustainable peace and ending the conflicts that are causing so much pain and damage around the world. There is more research emerging every year to demonstrate that.

UNSC_2016_SPV.7847_spch002.txt,2016,7847,"The Secretary-General: I thank the Spanish presidency of the Council. led by His Excellency Mr. Rajoy Brey, for convening this important meeting. I come with a plea for Member States to take steps to help victims of trafficking today and prevent further cases in the future. That means attention to immediate crimes and underlying causes.  Trafficking is a global problem, but the most vulnerable people are those caught in conflict: women, children, internally displaced persons and refugees. War provides oxygen to terrorist groups. It gives them space to flourish. the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), Boko Haram, Al-Shabaab and others are using trafficking and sexual violence as weapons of terror and an important source of revenue. Both ISIL and Boko Haram have engaged in the sexual enslavement of women and girls through trafficking. Yazidi girls captured in Iraq are trafficked into Syria and sold in open slave markets as if they were things, not people.  Before the conflict in Syria began, there were few, if any, human trafficking victims from that country. Now, victims from Syria - along with Iraq, Somalia and other conflict-torn countries - are found in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Traumatized Syrian refugee children are being forced to work. Instead of studying and playing, they are sewing clothes, serving food and selling items on the street. We have to fight trafficking for the sake of the victims When we do, we will also decrease funding for terrorists and make everyone safer. We need action on two fronts.  The first is justice and accountability. These are heinous crimes that demand immediate international action. International law needs to be respected and implemented. The United Nations is actively engaged in preventing sexual exploitation and abuse perpetrated by peacekeepers. States must also train peacekeepers and others to respond to trafficking in persons and prevent sexual exploitation and abuse. We should intensify training on preventing trafficking in persons as well as sexual exploitation and abuse.  The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime is a vital tool. I call on all States that are not party to its Protocol on trafficking in persons to join right away. I also urge countries to adopt dedicated anti-trafficking laws and national action plans. States should consider creating multidisciplinary law-enforcement units or specialized prosecutors' offices to address this threat.  Some States have successfully suppressed trafficking syndicates by targeting money-laundering and criminal proceeds. We should step up this action. Governments have to respond, especially when their own nationals are involved.  I call on all States to investigate and prosecute such cases, including those in which their own nationals commit this crime abroad. All perpetrators must be brought to justice.  The problem of trafficking is international in nature, and only an international response can succeed. The United Nations is bringing together Governments, other organizations and civil-society groups. I call for increased support to United Nations entities that are confronting the problem of trafficking.  I encourage contributions to the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Victims of Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, and the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery. These initiatives are helping victims to heal and become agents of change.  The second front is human rights and stability. If conflict gives oxygen to traffickers, human rights and stability suffocate them. That is why it is so important to advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The 2030 Agenda promises a life of dignity for all people and focuses on helping the farthest behind first. To fulfil this promise, we have to stand for the human rights of all victims and vulnerable people.  I call for all countries to ratify all international human rights, refugee, labour rights and crime-prevention conventions, and to put efforts into their effective implementation.  The majority of trafficking victims are women and girls. Our response must include special attention to their rights. States must adopt gender-sensitive and rights-based migration policies. We need strategic leadership in ending war and also in preventing conflicts and sustaining peace. That is why I have strengthened the commitment of the United Nations to supporting Member States in early action and in preventive diplomacy.  As this may be my last speech to the Council, let me emphasize once again that prevention should be at the forefront. I welcome my successor's focus on this very important priority.

UNSC_2017_SPV.7898_spch002.txt,2017,7898,"The Secretary-General: I thank the United Kingdom for convening this meeting, which builds on last December's adoption of the far-reaching resolution 2331 (2016), targeting human trafficking in conflict situations. Allow me to start with a short personal reflection.  I come from a country that, for centuries, engaged in the cruel trade in human beings. It is part of our history that we will never allowed to be forgotten. Of course, Portugal ultimately outlawed slavery in the nineteenth century, and a global norm against it has now long been in place. Indeed, the very conscience of the United Nations was shaped by that disgraceful violation of human dignity.  I wish that I could say that human trafficking is a thing of the past. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Trafficking networks have gone global. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), victims can be found in 106 countries. The International Labour Organization (ILO) reports that 21 million people around the world are victims of forced labour and extreme exploitation. Annual profits are estimated to be $150 billion. Beyond these numbers is the human toll: the lives cut short, the families and societies torn apart, and the gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.  Human trafficking takes many forms. Women and girls in particular are targeted again and again and again. We see brutal sexual exploitation, including forced prostitution, forced marriage and sexual slavery. We see the appalling trade in human organs. Let us also remember that modern manifestations of servitude may touch and even implicate us all. Global supply chains have transformed many lives for the better, but not always without cost. In some situations, clothes, food, smartphones, jewelry and other consumer goods may bear, wittingly or unwittingly, the traces of exploitation. Gleaming new skyscrapers may owe some of their shine to the sweat of bonded laborers.  Human trafficking thrives where the rule of law is weak or non-existent. Situations of armed conflict are especially virulent breeding grounds for human trafficking. In some of today's conflicts, we are confronted by armed groups that not only openly engage in enslavement and forced labour, but actually argue that it is legal. In Syria, Da'esh has organized slave markets and even published manuals instructing its fighters on how to capture, control and trade enslaved women and girls. The leaders of Boko Haram have also argued that slavery is legal. In other conflicts, other groups force men, women and children under their control to labour in unsafe mines, as porters and domestic servants, and on the frontlines.  Fleeing these threats, refugees and displaced people  confront new ones. As people take to the road, predators take advantage. Smugglers often coerce and manipulate individuals for profit and make them victims of sex or labour trafficking. Terrorists and violent extremists use sexual enslavement as a tool for recruitment. Drug traffickers use kidnapping and ransom to finance their operations, and criminal gangs force unaccompanied children into a life of petty crime. Moreover, impunity prevails. According to the UNODC December 2016 Global Report on Trafi'icking in Persons, there are hardly any convictions for crimes related to human trafficking in conflict situations or elsewhere. The lack of aggressive investigations and prosecutions only adds to the injustice, allows perpetrators to function without fear, fuels corruption and creates widespread disillusion. Allow me to make another personal reflection in that regard.  I remember that when I worked in Government, I never expected my two children to be victims of trafficking, but I always was afraid of the impact of drugs on their lives. I think that is the same with most political leaders around the world. Most political leaders around are afraid of the impact of drugs on their families, but they do not think it likely that their families will be impact by human trafficking. That is probably why we have seen much greater priority given to fighting drug traffickers than to fighting the traffickers ofhuman beings. Ofcourse, drug trafficking is an awful crime, but to traffic in human beings is, I must, much worse. I believe that it is our duty to really commit ourselves to doing everything we can to make this a clear priority for all Governments and in all forms of international cooperation.  There is much that we can do both to punish human trafficking and to prevent it in the first place. A solid legal and normative framework is in place, including the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its Protocol against Trafficking in Persons, which includes the first internationally agreed definition of the crime of trafficking in persons and provides a framework for effectively preventing and combatting it. ILO conventions and the Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons complement the Protocol, and are further key parts of the picture. All of these build on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Under the under the Rome Statue, enslavement can constitute a crime against humanity.  United Nations military and civilian personnel must also be held accountable to these standards. I continue to take steps to strengthen our efforts to prevent and respond to sexual exploitation and abuse committed under the United Nations flag. Since human trafficking does not respect borders, Member States need to strengthen cooperation on law enforcement, investigations and intelligence-sharing. We also need to strengthen coordination among Member States, civil society, the business community and United Nations entities, including through the Inter-Agency Coordination Group Against Trafficking in Persons. At the same time, we need to get at the underlying vulnerabilities that fuel this phenomenon, for example by empowering girls through education, by respecting the rights of minorities and by establishing safe and legal channels of migration.  The 2030 Agenda for sustainable Development can also help us break the chains of exploitation. Three of the goals explicitly address human trafficking, including sex trafficking, forced labour, child labour and the recruitment and use of child soldiers. As we engage the private sector as a key partner in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, we need to ensure it takes greater responsibility when sourcing from conflict areas. Better data will be crucial. Funding is critical. The United Nations is also committed not only to supporting victims, but to incorporating their voices and views as we develop and implement anti-trafficking interventions.  Finally, at a time of divisions in so many areas, this should be an issue that can unite us. Let us come together around the key issues of prosecution, protection and prevention, and thereby build a future without human trafficking.

UNSC_2017_SPV.8022_spch002.txt,2017,8022,"The Deputy Secretary-General: I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for this opportunity to brief the Council on my recent visit to Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This undertaking, from 19 to 27 July, was the first of its kind - a high- level mission focused entirely on women and peace and security and development. I was pleased to be joined by the Executive Director of UN-Women and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, both of whom are here with me today, as well as Ms. Bineta Diop, the African Union Commission's Special Envoy on Women, Peace and Security. We were four African women from two organizations, visiting two countries, with one goal - advancing peace by advancing the equality, empowerment and well-being of women. This reflects both the Secretary-General's vision and the Security Council's agenda, as embodied initially in resolution 1325 (2000) and reaffirmed most recently in resolution 2242 (2015).  The mission also deepened the partnership between the United Nations and the African Union (AU), as we work together to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union's Agenda 2063, as well as the accompanying Joint United Nations-African Union Framework for Enhanced Partnership in Peace and Security, signed in April on the initiative of the Secretary-General. I am pleased that the Permanent Observer from the African Union will be briefing the Council alongside me today, reinforcing the joint nature of our mission. In that broad context, I would like to share with the Council some of what we saw and heard, as well as some thoughts on what we must do now.  In both countries, we met with Heads of State, ministers, donors, diplomats, faith leaders, Parliaments and the United Nations mission and country teams. We made a point of spending the lion's share of our time with the women and girls most affected by conflicts, including in visits to camps for internally displaced persons. While each country is unique, the situations share some commonalities. Both have dismally low levels of women's participation in politics and are experiencing conflicts marked by extremely high levels of sexual- and gender-based violence. In the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo, sexual violence is widespread. In northern Nigeria, abductions, forced marriage and the use of women as suicide bombers have taken a terrible toll, and in the camps, sexual exploitation, including in the form of sex for food, is a new and alarming trend. The international community must better understand the role of women in development and peacebuilding, together with the gender dimensions of conflict, if our responses are to be effective.  Both countries are also in the grip of grave humanitarian crises. In Nigeria, the eight-year conflict in the North-East has generated a risk of famine, displaced 1.9 million people and left 8.5 million in need of assistance. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 7 million people need assistance and 3.8 million are displaced, the largest internally displaced population in Africa and one of the worst such situations in the world. Those dire circumstances are being made worse by a large gap in humanitarian funding, including the issue of failures to meet the commitments made at the Oslo Humanitarian Conference on Nigeria and the Lake Chad Region. There is an acute need for sustained and scaled-up funding to avert famine in Nigeria and address the humanitarian crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Beyond those immediate concerns, since both crises are rooted in conflict, poverty and political challenges, they will require regional political solutions and integrated responses that cut across historically siloed approaches.  Let me turn now to some of the specifics of each. In Nigeria, we were moved by our meeting with the Chibok girls - facilitated by the Honourable Minister of  Women Affairs. Their remarkable strength as survivors, rather than victims, is inspiring. Many are receiving an education and psychosocial support to prepare them for reintegration. But thousands of other young women who have been abducted and returned, subjected to sexual violence and affected by conflict in other ways have yet to receive adequate support. We also interacted with displaced women and girls who are facing exploitation and abuse in the camps. We held meetings with women's leaders who underscored the need to address mental health and women's empowerment.  I commend the Governments of the Niger, Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria for their efforts to promote stability, including through the Multinational Joint Task Force within the Lake Chad Basin regional cooperation. International support will continue to be crucial in addressing the root causes of the crisis in those very complex situations.  I am also pleased to note that since our visit, the Acting President of Nigeria has established a judicial commission to investigate alleged violations of human rights by Nigerian security agencies, and to recommend ways to prevent such violations. I commend that initiative and encourage the relevant authorities to include sexual- and gender-based violence within the commission's work. The United Nations stands ready to support that important effort and also to reinforce protection measures for displaced women and girls.  The situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains complex and volatile, with State and non-State armed actors alike perpetuating violence and the illicit flows of natural resources and deepening political tensions, including over the delayed elections. There are real risks ofincreased political instability and deepening crises if the 31 December 2016 agreement becomes irrelevant.  We are all aware of those and other challenges, yet we also see a real opportunity to get the country on track towards stability. In all of our meetings, we emphasized the need to respect and implement the 31 December agreement and the willingness of the United Nations to provide its support. That endeavour will require further investment, not a scaling back of our capacities and resources. While it is imperative to ensure the most efficient use of available resources, particularly in a fiscally constrained environment, it is equally critical that mitigating measures are taken to avail vulnerable populations of the level of protection they need. In that  respect, I commend the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) for the steps taken to mitigate the possible impact of the closure of its bases in some locations and for its efforts to develop and implement a more holistic approach to the protection of civilians.  We commend the efforts of the Government, including through the appointment of a personal representative of the President on sexual violence and child recruitment, to decrease incidents of conflict- related sexual violence committed by the security forces and to take real steps towards delisting from the Secretary-General's reports on conflict-related sexual violence. Those efforts must continue, along with our pledged support, until we reach zero.  At the time of our visit, the electoral commission had registered more than 80 per cent of voters. That number now stands at more than 90 per cent, with registration expected to be accelerated in the Kasais following the calming of tensions. Of those registered, 48 per cent are women, placing the country in the same bracket as more established democracies, such as the Solomon Islands and Paraguay. The collection of sex- disaggregated data is itself commendable, as is the provision on gender parity in the constitution, which should now be supported and translated into law.  In that regard, we had lengthy conversations with President Kabila, who has committed to releasing an elections calendar and to holding elections that are violence-free and Congolese-led, but where international observers will be welcome. We welcome that commitment and look forward to the early release of that electoral calendar.  The United Nations-AU delegation met with women in Goma who were being moved as a result of the closing of an internally displaced persons camp where they had lived for years in barely life sustaining conditions. Despite those hardships, some women did not want to return to their communities without assurances that a key means of support in the camps - microcredit - would continue to be available. While it was not possible to delay the closure of any of the camps, I am encouraged to note that our intervention made it possible for some of the women to remain in local communities and to continue to be supported through the micro-credit programmes that have been facilitated by UN-Women. For these women, security is a matter of financial empowerment. I thank the donors that are generously supporting these efforts and call on all to do even more.  We also met with women who have no choice but to cook with coal in their tents, at great risk to their health and that of their children. Those tents were their only shelter and coal was their only accessible mode of sustenance and heat. We asked about the future of those women and their families upon the closure of the camp and were informed that the United Nations does not have the funds or capacity to shift from humanitarian assistance to support host communities or the reintegrated individuals. While we may debate the humanitarian-development nexus philosophically here in New York, without resources flowing to both sectors simultaneously and a real investment in early recovery, we can neither sustain peace nor prevent future gender- based violence. In that spirit, I encourage donors to respond to the Democratic Republic of the Congo's reintegration challenges at this time - based on need, and need alone.  While in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, our delegation was briefed on MONUSCO's investigation into the murder of two experts working for the United Nations. The report on that horrific incident, which I strongly condemn, is to be published shortly, and I would like to reiterate the need for thorough investigations and justice for the perpetrators of that crime. The United Nations will continue to support that effort until justice is served.  I would like to thank the many dedicated men and women with whom we met during our important and productive journey, in particular my colleagues in MONUSCO, especially the women, whose work was greatly appreciated by all we met, as well as the United Nations country team in both countries - and within them UN-Women, whose efforts to support the empowerment of women is so crucial. I am most grateful for the invaluable contribution from to the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary- General on Sexual Violence in Conflict.  I would also like to express my gratitude and thanks to the African Union as a partner in progress. Its partnership is invaluable as we strive to continue to work together to stabilize the region, to advance the Silencing the Guns by 2020 initiative, and to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union's Agenda 2063.  One message resounds most - investing in women and girls must be central to our efforts in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and beyond if we are to have sustainable peace and development. Giving special consideration to the context will be key to the responses that deliver the right results. We look forward to working with national Governments, regional organizations, civil society, women and girls themselves and international partners to deliver results that will advance peace, development and dignity for all.  ",The Deputy Secretary-General,,English,u," I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for this opportunity to brief the Council on my recent visit to Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This undertaking, from 19 to 27 July, was the first of its kind - a high- level mission focused entirely on women and peace and security and development. I was pleased to be joined by the Executive Director of UN-Women and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, both of whom are here with me today, as well as Ms. Bineta Diop, the African Union Commission's Special Envoy on Women, Peace and Security. We were four African women from two organizations, visiting two countries, with one goal - advancing peace by advancing the equality, empowerment and well-being of women. This reflects both the Secretary-General's vision and the Security Council's agenda, as embodied initially in resolution 1325 (2000) and reaffirmed most recently in resolution 2242 (2015).  The mission also deepened the partnership between the United Nations and the African Union (AU), as we work together to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union's Agenda 2063, as well as the accompanying Joint United Nations-African Union Framework for Enhanced Partnership in Peace and Security, signed in April on the initiative of the Secretary-General. I am pleased that the Permanent Observer from the African Union will be briefing the Council alongside me today, reinforcing the joint nature of our mission. In that broad context, I would like to share with the Council some of what we saw and heard, as well as some thoughts on what we must do now.  In both countries, we met with Heads of State, ministers, donors, diplomats, faith leaders, Parliaments and the United Nations mission and country teams. We made a point of spending the lion's share of our time with the women and girls most affected by conflicts, including in visits to camps for internally displaced persons. While each country is unique, the situations share some commonalities. Both have dismally low levels of women's participation in politics and are experiencing conflicts marked by extremely high levels of sexual- and gender-based violence. In the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo, sexual violence is widespread. In northern Nigeria, abductions, forced marriage and the use of women as suicide bombers have taken a terrible toll, and in the camps, sexual exploitation, including in the form of sex for food, is a new and alarming trend. The international community must better understand the role of women in development and peacebuilding, together with the gender dimensions of conflict, if our responses are to be effective.  Both countries are also in the grip of grave humanitarian crises. In Nigeria, the eight-year conflict in the North-East has generated a risk of famine, displaced 1.9 million people and left 8.5 million in need of assistance. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 7 million people need assistance and 3.8 million are displaced, the largest internally displaced population in Africa and one of the worst such situations in the world. Those dire circumstances are being made worse by a large gap in humanitarian funding, including the issue of failures to meet the commitments made at the Oslo Humanitarian Conference on Nigeria and the Lake Chad Region. There is an acute need for sustained and scaled-up funding to avert famine in Nigeria and address the humanitarian crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Beyond those immediate concerns, since both crises are rooted in conflict, poverty and political challenges, they will require regional political solutions and integrated responses that cut across historically siloed approaches.  Let me turn now to some of the specifics of each. In Nigeria, we were moved by our meeting with the Chibok girls - facilitated by the Honourable Minister of  Women Affairs. Their remarkable strength as survivors, rather than victims, is inspiring. Many are receiving an education and psychosocial support to prepare them for reintegration. But thousands of other young women who have been abducted and returned, subjected to sexual violence and affected by conflict in other ways have yet to receive adequate support. We also interacted with displaced women and girls who are facing exploitation and abuse in the camps. We held meetings with women's leaders who underscored the need to address mental health and women's empowerment.  I commend the Governments of the Niger, Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria for their efforts to promote stability, including through the Multinational Joint Task Force within the Lake Chad Basin regional cooperation. International support will continue to be crucial in addressing the root causes of the crisis in those very complex situations.  I am also pleased to note that since our visit, the Acting President of Nigeria has established a judicial commission to investigate alleged violations of human rights by Nigerian security agencies, and to recommend ways to prevent such violations. I commend that initiative and encourage the relevant authorities to include sexual- and gender-based violence within the commission's work. The United Nations stands ready to support that important effort and also to reinforce protection measures for displaced women and girls.  The situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains complex and volatile, with State and non-State armed actors alike perpetuating violence and the illicit flows of natural resources and deepening political tensions, including over the delayed elections. There are real risks ofincreased political instability and deepening crises if the 31 December 2016 agreement becomes irrelevant.  We are all aware of those and other challenges, yet we also see a real opportunity to get the country on track towards stability. In all of our meetings, we emphasized the need to respect and implement the 31 December agreement and the willingness of the United Nations to provide its support. That endeavour will require further investment, not a scaling back of our capacities and resources. While it is imperative to ensure the most efficient use of available resources, particularly in a fiscally constrained environment, it is equally critical that mitigating measures are taken to avail vulnerable populations of the level of protection they need. In that  respect, I commend the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) for the steps taken to mitigate the possible impact of the closure of its bases in some locations and for its efforts to develop and implement a more holistic approach to the protection of civilians.  We commend the efforts of the Government, including through the appointment of a personal representative of the President on sexual violence and child recruitment, to decrease incidents of conflict- related sexual violence committed by the security forces and to take real steps towards delisting from the Secretary-General's reports on conflict-related sexual violence. Those efforts must continue, along with our pledged support, until we reach zero.  At the time of our visit, the electoral commission had registered more than 80 per cent of voters. That number now stands at more than 90 per cent, with registration expected to be accelerated in the Kasais following the calming of tensions. Of those registered, 48 per cent are women, placing the country in the same bracket as more established democracies, such as the Solomon Islands and Paraguay. The collection of sex- disaggregated data is itself commendable, as is the provision on gender parity in the constitution, which should now be supported and translated into law.  In that regard, we had lengthy conversations with President Kabila, who has committed to releasing an elections calendar and to holding elections that are violence-free and Congolese-led, but where international observers will be welcome. We welcome that commitment and look forward to the early release of that electoral calendar.  The United Nations-AU delegation met with women in Goma who were being moved as a result of the closing of an internally displaced persons camp where they had lived for years in barely life sustaining conditions. Despite those hardships, some women did not want to return to their communities without assurances that a key means of support in the camps - microcredit - would continue to be available. While it was not possible to delay the closure of any of the camps, I am encouraged to note that our intervention made it possible for some of the women to remain in local communities and to continue to be supported through the micro-credit programmes that have been facilitated by UN-Women. For these women, security is a matter of financial empowerment. I thank the donors that are generously supporting these efforts and call on all to do even more.  We also met with women who have no choice but to cook with coal in their tents, at great risk to their health and that of their children. Those tents were their only shelter and coal was their only accessible mode of sustenance and heat. We asked about the future of those women and their families upon the closure of the camp and were informed that the United Nations does not have the funds or capacity to shift from humanitarian assistance to support host communities or the reintegrated individuals. While we may debate the humanitarian-development nexus philosophically here in New York, without resources flowing to both sectors simultaneously and a real investment in early recovery, we can neither sustain peace nor prevent future gender- based violence. In that spirit, I encourage donors to respond to the Democratic Republic of the Congo's reintegration challenges at this time - based on need, and need alone.  While in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, our delegation was briefed on MONUSCO's investigation into the murder of two experts working for the United Nations. The report on that horrific incident, which I strongly condemn, is to be published shortly, and I would like to reiterate the need for thorough investigations and justice for the perpetrators of that crime.

UNSC_2017_SPV.8022_spch023.txt,2017,8022,"The Deputy Secretary-General: I want to reiterate my deep appreciation to the Council for giving us this opportunity to speak on this issue. It is a critical one that strikes at the core of human rights, which are women's rights. It is inhumane and strips women of their dignity. It is a scar for life and often visits families beyond that one person, and certainly many children that are born as a result.  In answering the question that was put forward by the representative of France, this trip in and of itself was really also a response to what we felt was putting life into the just texts that the Council has adopted in resolutions 1325 (2000) and 2242 (2015), but really trying to explain better what it is that we would be looking at in countries where we want to see prevention and sustaining peace a reality and how to make the investments of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development a reality.  I think that in this trip it was very clear that both Sustainable Development Goals 16 and 17 were critical - that without strong institutions we cannot make the demands of those aspirations that we have for the Agenda. It is therefore important that we begin to think of what sort of investments are going to be needed up front if we are to really see many national Governments responding to closing the gap between the reality and the aspirations. I think we got keen insights into that issue, just as we also did with respect to partnerships, making many frameworks we have between the United Nations and other institutions a reality.  I think in that regard we were trying to walk the talk and move very quickly into seeing how, with the African Union, we could change the narrative in making implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063 a reality. What better entry point is there for looking at the most vulnerable populations? Which are also the largest populations? We talk about 50 per cent of our populations, 50 per cent of our assets that need investments, need protecting and need their human rights. It was wonderful to get the response that we got.  This trip was the supposed to also include a trip to South Sudan. We were not able to go there due to unforeseen circumstances, but with this response we will now be able to look not only at the African region but at other regions as well, in order to draw together these issues, give a comprehensive view and bring to everyone's continuous notice the complexities and different ranges of context, not just in the conflicts that we have seen in Africa but also across other regions.  It is critical when we do make these trips, as we felt very strongly in both cases, that what we see and what we come back with needs follow-up. We lose integrity when we return from these trips and we cannot follow up with the promises and the commitments that were made. In particular, I would like to thank both Governments.  In Nigeria, we heard from young girls that they faced a challenge. While they were appreciative of the fact that they had a camp, security and a home, they were totally devastated by the daily situation of having to exchange sex for food. This fact made a very powerful impression on us. How could we let that girl go back? Well, fortunately for us, one of the recommendations we made was, very simply, to change the policy. The people dealing with the distribution of food in camps should be women, not men. One should start with that change, and in the course of our interactions with the Nigerian Government we were able to get it agreed to. Similarly, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we heard women talk about the need not so much for more security from the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo when they returned either into host communities or their own communities, but for more microcredit. We could see tents where we they were using coal as fuel for their cookstoves, which was harmful for children. Upon our return, we were able to ask those who were involved with the clean cookstoves programme if they could scale-up the programme across all the camps where this was happening, and actually replace the stoves.  I think that these are concrete things that make a difference when we go on a field visit, we come back and something happens. We were also able to expand the microcredit for those women for that period. But so much more is needed. So I hope that every trip we make will result in commitments that become a reality in people's lives.  Once again, I want to say that we will revert to members of the Council. We are committed to attaining zero gender-based violence, particularly in conflict, and to holding Governments and, hopefully, all those who perpetrate these crimes to account. It is important that this be seen as a work in progress. People live in different realities. I think we saw immense challenges, but also many opportunities; and we believe that, together, we can go much further.  I would just like to underscore our appreciation to the Council for creating more opportunities to make this work. Council members' visits to many countries, including Colombia and the Lake Chad basin, have made it possible for us to raise our ambitions in terms of what we do.

UNSC_2018_SPV.8234_spch002.txt,2018,8234,"The Deputy Secretary-General: Let me begin by commanding Peru and His Excellency Ambassador Gustavo Meza-Cuadra for convening this important open debate on sexual violence and conflict. I also very warmly welcome Ms. Razia Sultana here today to amplify the voices of the Rohingya community and to offer an account to the plight of women and girls systematically targeted due to their religion or ethnicity.  This year in Myanmar, and in many other conflict situations, the widespread threat and use the sexual violence is once again being used as a tactic to advance military, economic and ideological objectives. Once again it has been a driver of massive forced displacement. Let me be clear: both genders endure the horrific brutality of sexual violence in conflict. Sexual violence is also a very common method of torture of detainees, and in many conflicts most detainees are men and boys. But overall women and girls are disproportionately affected. Gender-based discrimination is the invisible driver of most crimes of sexual violence. The lower one's status in terms of wealth, health and education, the greater her vulnerability and exposure to harm.  Last year, I travelled with Special Representative of the Secretary-General Pramila Patten to Nigeria and to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In both nations, the consequences of sexual violence are profound and enduring for survivors, their families and their communities. Survivors are forced to live with the untreated physical and psychological trauma, the social stigma and unwanted pregnancies. The children born of rape are often ostracized and relegated to the margins of society. That serves yet again to highlight the fact that, in the end, sexual violence has consequences for all affected women, girls, men and boys. It is a deliberate tactic to humiliate and disempower and undermine social cohesion. Our responsibility must be to bring justice, recognition and reparations to the survivors of those horrendous crimes - not only justice in the courtroom but also social justice and economic empowerment.  We should recognize and support the resilience of the many survivors who are working as agents of change. Ifwe are to prevent these crimes being repeated, we must ensure accountability and deterrence. In that context, I welcome the continued engagement by those parties listed by the Secretary-General in his reports on conflict-related sexual violence. For example, the signing of a unilateral communique by a coalition of armed groups in Mali in July 2017 and the development of a joint communique implementation plan by the Iraq Government last month are both very encouraging.  Let me also highlight the increased vigilance being shown by peacekeepers in protecting women, girls, men and boys from sexual violence as part of their protection-of-civilians mandate. Last month in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a female engagement team of 16 soldiers from the United Kingdom, South Africa and Nepal supported a civilian mission to one of the country's most remote areas in response to reports of abductions and sexual violence inflicted on hundreds of civilians. This shows the value of alert networks and the importance of women in peacekeeping to better address conflict-related sexual violence.  Women's protection advisers deployed to United Nations peace operations also have a leading role to play in supporting Government counterparts in implementing their commitments. Those commitments include engaging all parties to the conflict to prevent sexual violence and ensuring that survivors and civil society organizations can voice their concerns about security, protection and limitations in service provision and that they can help shape inclusive new policies and laws.  Resolution 2106 (2013) calls on all actors - the Security Council, parties to armed conflict, Member States and United Nations entities - to do much more to combat impunity for those crimes. Let us intensify our efforts to end the horrific litany of sexual violence in conflict so that our women, girls, men and boys have no less burden to bear as they work to rebuild their shattered lives.

UNSC_2018_SPV.8306_spch002.txt,2018,8306,"The Deputy Secretary-General: Let me begin by thanking the President of the Security Council for convening today's meeting on women and peace and security in the Sahel, as well as for Sweden's leadership on this issue during the country's time in the Security Council.  Yesterday I returned from a joint United Nations- African Union mission to three countries - South Sudan, the Niger and Chad. That mission was the second of its kind, following last year's high-level visit to Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. When I reported back to the Security Council at that time (see S/PV.8022) - marking the first time the Security Council heard a briefing on women and peace and security in relation to a country situation - members of the Council requested further trips of this nature, a request that I am pleased to report we took forward. I would like to thank the people and the Governments of South Sudan, Chad and the Niger.  We were joined in the Niger and Chad by Foreign Minister Wallstrom in her capacity as President of the Security Council for July. At various points on the trip, we were also joined by senior United Nations colleagues, including the Executive Directors of UN- Women and the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, the Special Representative of the Secretary- General on Sexual Violence in Conflict and his Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region of Africa, and representatives of the United Nations Regional Office for Central Africa and the Sustainable Energy for All initiative. We were also joined by the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for West Africa and the Sahel and the Special Adviser on the Sahel. I was very proud to lead a delegation in which women made up the majority.  Our purpose was to highlight issues of women and peace and security and development. Throughout the trip, we met with women civil society leaders, community representatives and religious and traditional chiefs. We visited many development projects, and then met with local authorities, senior Government officials and Heads of State to discuss the key challenges and opportunities that exist and to convey the voices and messages that we had heard from women. Four issues resonated most dramatically.  The first was the need to address the stark cost that women and girls pay for conflict. That was particularly evident in South Sudan, where we visited women in protection-of-civilian sites who spoke of the violence they face both inside and outside the camps. It was also borne out in the stories of women in rural areas of Chad, where the impact of Boko Haram has resulted in insecurity, loss of family members and the increased use of female suicide bombers.  Secondly, we heard a universal and increasingly frustrated call by women for greater inclusion, representation and participation in all areas of society. They demand greater participation in decision-making. In Juba in South Sudan, in Addis Ababa and in Khartoum they asked that their voices be heard in the peace process. In Chad and the Niger they advocated for the implementation of legislation on a quota for political participation and the recognition of their role in the economy and in preventing violent extremism.  Greater representation at the community level is a further imperative. The women religious leaders we met in Chad are a very powerful voice against gender inequality and against the attacks on women's rights that are such a core part of terrorist groups' strategy and identity. By teaching the Qur'an, they are sending a message that the Qur'an and Islam are for both men and women and that Islam is a religion of peace.  Women are also seeking greater inclusion in the economy. In the B01 region of the Lake Chad basin we saw the multiple roles fisherwomen were playing in maintaining livelihoods in the absence of men who had been killed and in building community resilience in the face of environmental degradation and insecurity caused by the Boko Haram insurgency. Such models, if scaled up, have the potential to generate economic dividends for the country. We reminded leaders that inclusion is not a woman's issue; it is, rather, a whole-of- society issue.  Thirdly, there is a clear need to keep countries experiencing fragility today from becoming failed States tomorrow. Chad and the Niger are dealing with challenges that are largely not of their making, including insecurity that originated beyond their borders and climate change, which respects no borders at all. Despite their own constraints, they are among the world's most generous hosts of refugees. But the impact on their economies and development aspirations has been profound. The President of the Niger, for example, presented to us his renaissance plan to meet the basic needs of the country's population, but it has been hampered by the fall in uranium and oil prices and the expenditures on security. Security therefore comes at a price; all too often it comes at the expense of development.  In that context, it is critical that we all step up, which means urgently increasing our budget support for development in those and other fragile countries. It is a matter, first and foremost, of human dignity. But it is also a matter of peace and security. Investment in development must be transformative: it must support scaled-up, integrated projects such as we saw in the Niger when we visited the United Nations programme that brought together health, nutrition, agriculture, water and sanitation, alongside women's empowerment, recognizing the context of climate change. I am confident that the reforms that we are pursuing in the United Nations will provide the necessary space to scale up such interventions.  With today's conflicts being greater in both number and complexity, it is more important than ever to find the path to peacebuilding and sustainable development for all. Across the three countries we visited, it is evident that women can be the agents of a new and necessary approach - a new narrative, a new paradigm.  We sensed during our visit an increasingly pressing need to operationalize the policies, frameworks and agendas that we have in place. For 18 years, the Security Council has discussed the agenda item of women and peace and security in annual thematic debates. Once a year we assert that gender equality is foundational to stability and peace. But rarely have we moved beyond the principles. We believe that now is the time to move from frameworks to action. Investing in peace now in this region will bring lasting global dividends for all.  With resolution 1325 (2000) and the seven resolutions that build on it we have the necessary commitments. We have tools such as a recalibrated United Nations Integrated Strategy for the Sahel. We must now bring these tools and commitments to life, while encouraging further alignment among the United Nations Support Plan for the Sahel, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Agenda 2063 and, most important, national plans.  The cost of inaction is high. Poverty, weak institutions and gender inequality, including the abhorrent practices such as child marriage, are creating an environment ripe for extremism. I thank members of the Council again for supporting such joint missions, which we believe contribute greatly to advancing the work of the Council. We look forward to working together to draw the appropriate lessons towards building lives of peace, security and equality for all.  ",The Deputy Secretary-General,,English,u," Let me begin by thanking the President of the Security Council for convening today's meeting on women and peace and security in the Sahel, as well as for Sweden's leadership on this issue during the country's time in the Security Council.  Yesterday I returned from a joint United Nations- African Union mission to three countries - South Sudan, the Niger and Chad. That mission was the second of its kind, following last year's high-level visit to Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. When I reported back to the Security Council at that time (see S/PV.8022) - marking the first time the Security Council heard a briefing on women and peace and security in relation to a country situation - members of the Council requested further trips of this nature, a request that I am pleased to report we took forward. I would like to thank the people and the Governments of South Sudan, Chad and the Niger.  We were joined in the Niger and Chad by Foreign Minister Wallstrom in her capacity as President of the Security Council for July. At various points on the trip, we were also joined by senior United Nations colleagues, including the Executive Directors of UN- Women and the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, the Special Representative of the Secretary- General on Sexual Violence in Conflict and his Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region of Africa, and representatives of the United Nations Regional Office for Central Africa and the Sustainable Energy for All initiative. We were also joined by the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for West Africa and the Sahel and the Special Adviser on the Sahel. I was very proud to lead a delegation in which women made up the majority.  Our purpose was to highlight issues of women and peace and security and development. Throughout the trip, we met with women civil society leaders, community representatives and religious and traditional chiefs. We visited many development projects, and then met with local authorities, senior Government officials and Heads of State to discuss the key challenges and opportunities that exist and to convey the voices and messages that we had heard from women. Four issues resonated most dramatically.  The first was the need to address the stark cost that women and girls pay for conflict. That was particularly evident in South Sudan, where we visited women in protection-of-civilian sites who spoke of the violence they face both inside and outside the camps. It was also borne out in the stories of women in rural areas of Chad, where the impact of Boko Haram has resulted in insecurity, loss of family members and the increased use of female suicide bombers.  Secondly, we heard a universal and increasingly frustrated call by women for greater inclusion, representation and participation in all areas of society. They demand greater participation in decision-making. In Juba in South Sudan, in Addis Ababa and in Khartoum they asked that their voices be heard in the peace process. In Chad and the Niger they advocated for the implementation of legislation on a quota for political participation and the recognition of their role in the economy and in preventing violent extremism.  Greater representation at the community level is a further imperative. The women religious leaders we met in Chad are a very powerful voice against gender inequality and against the attacks on women's rights that are such a core part of terrorist groups' strategy and identity. By teaching the Qur'an, they are sending a message that the Qur'an and Islam are for both men and women and that Islam is a religion of peace.  Women are also seeking greater inclusion in the economy. In the B01 region of the Lake Chad basin we saw the multiple roles fisherwomen were playing in maintaining livelihoods in the absence of men who had been killed and in building community resilience in the face of environmental degradation and insecurity caused by the Boko Haram insurgency. Such models, if scaled up, have the potential to generate economic dividends for the country. We reminded leaders that inclusion is not a woman's issue; it is, rather, a whole-of- society issue.  Thirdly, there is a clear need to keep countries experiencing fragility today from becoming failed States tomorrow. Chad and the Niger are dealing with challenges that are largely not of their making, including insecurity that originated beyond their borders and climate change, which respects no borders at all. Despite their own constraints, they are among the world's most generous hosts of refugees. But the impact on their economies and development aspirations has been profound. The President of the Niger, for example, presented to us his renaissance plan to meet the basic needs of the country's population, but it has been hampered by the fall in uranium and oil prices and the expenditures on security. Security therefore comes at a price; all too often it comes at the expense of development.  In that context, it is critical that we all step up, which means urgently increasing our budget support for development in those and other fragile countries. It is a matter, first and foremost, of human dignity. But it is also a matter of peace and security. Investment in development must be transformative: it must support scaled-up, integrated projects such as we saw in the Niger when we visited the United Nations programme that brought together health, nutrition, agriculture, water and sanitation, alongside women's empowerment, recognizing the context of climate change. I am confident that the reforms that we are pursuing in the United Nations will provide the necessary space to scale up such interventions.  With today's conflicts being greater in both number and complexity, it is more important than ever to find the path to peacebuilding and sustainable development for all. Across the three countries we visited, it is evident that women can be the agents of a new and necessary approach - a new narrative, a new paradigm.

The cost of inaction is high. Poverty, weak institutions and gender inequality, including the abhorrent practices such as child marriage, are creating an environment ripe for extremism. I thank members of the Council again for supporting such joint missions, which we believe contribute greatly to advancing the work of the Council. We look forward to working together to draw the appropriate lessons towards building lives of peace, security and equality for all.  "
UNSC_2018_SPV.8306_spch022.txt,2018,8306,"The Deputy Secretary-General: I thank speakers for their incredibly supportive response to the opportunity that we have had to share about our visit - but, more important, about the big issues.  The representative of Chad referred to the importance of the recalibrated United Nations Integrated Strategy for the Sahel, which cannot be underscored enough. While we await the African Union's review of the Strategy, one thing we have learned is the need  to be better coordinated and coherent and really work towards ajoined-up response in terms of investments.  We also thank the representative of France because, along with France, Germany and the European Union, the Alliance for the Sahel has also been incredibly important in bringing this all together. I think that many of the Heads of State in the region emphasize the need for coordination and living up to the commitments that were made five or six years ago, which have yet to realize any benefits. Had we done so, we probably would not be in the position that we are in now. The urgency of getting behind one strategy is really important. We are grateful that that is an outcome of the Security Council.  I must say that the real concern for me is that that urgency must come when countries are grappling with a fragile State and everything that comes with it - the expectations of people and trying to maintain a democracy, which is not just about elections. It is about the three arms of Government, which need to be supported equally, and that gap is closing as countries inch towards becoming failed States. That is a very real concern. We saw that on the ground. We saw the concerns of Heads of State there.  It was reflected in many instances. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden said, we should not have been going to fistula clinics and seeing them full of young girls. We should have been going to classrooms. Instead, here we were in Niamey, with three centres. We only saw one, and they had huge demands to expand. We were really looking to say that we should be looking at prevention, and prevention meant getting girls into school and investments in development. I suppose that the eight-point plan for the Republic of the Niger did have money for education, but there is just no fiscal space for it because funding is being taken up by the responsibilities to care for migrants coming back across the borders from Lybia, as well as by security issues related to handling Boko Haram.  I think the other concern is that Boko Haram is becoming much more organized. In its own way, it is providing an alternative to what Governments cannot provide for their peoples. There is an urgent need to stop that trend. It was not just the suicide bombers that we saw, who obviously in some cases were either hypnotized or forced into it, but there are many willing girls who are now following and communities that are sympathizing with many of these terrorist groups. That, I think, is far more dangerous and we need to turn it back.  We also saw the challenge of the conflicts between farmers and herders across the region. Again, I would emphasize that population growth and other dynamics, such as urbanization, and the stress they put on food security are something we have not really looked at. We have gone to the symptoms and looked at them from the political, ethnic or religious point of view. It is much more than that, and I think that we need a better, joined-up response to how we articulate the Sustainable Development Goal on cities, for instance. This happens in context and has repercussions on insecurity. I would say that we did see a really wonderful opportunity of getting behind a cross-border initiative of the Lake Chad Basin Commission to draft its plan, which really answered a number of the issues we had and took care of the context of climate and conflict. But it needs to be urgently supported. There are frameworks and vehicles, checks and balances that we can put in there with respect to the areas that we really worry about or the risks that we think we can mitigate through a better joined-up partnership of multilateral system. But it needs to happen now.  I think that reforms in the development system really do help in bringing about good coordination. We saw excellent coordination in the humanitarian and development nexus in Chad and in South Sudan, where of course the tensions probably helped us to come together. We also saw it in the Niger, when they got together with the ruling rural integrated programmes.  I would point to the African Union-United Nations framework for peace, security and development. The Secretary-General was there yesterday. They launched the action plan for development, which includes the Sahel Strategy. We believe that that represented a solid step forward. Again, we would plead for support for that and for the African Women Leaders Network. That is a strong group. They will manage to put together and launch the fund for women. It takes a different angle. This time they are looking at building the capacities of women fund managers, which means they are looking to leverage resources that are available in the private sector and elsewhere. It is not just a case of grants; it is a case of how we leverage more funding for that. The work continues.

UNSC_2018_SPV.8382_spch003.txt,2018,8382,"The Secretary-General (spoke in Spanish): I thank the presidency of Bolivia for give me the opportunity to address the implementation of the women and peace and security agenda through the political and economic empowerment of women. I congratulate the Council on its efforts this past year to increase the number of speakers from civil society, for the work of its group of experts on women and peace and security, and to achieve parity between genders and guarantee the gender perspective among the speakers during the presidencies of some of its members. (spoke in French)  Never, over the past 30 years, has the number of countries in the grip of some form of violent conflict been so high. Forced displacements due to wars and persecution are more numerous than never. Climate change and underdevelopment are increasingly threatening to our security, while the question of human rights has been relegated to the background. There is every reason to worry, but we must resist the ambient pessimism and not lose sight of the fact that solutions exist. Hope has always guided our steps in the action we collectively take on behalf of women and peace and security. This is in issue that promises change, which includes many elements we need to address the complex challenges the world is facing: climate change, disarmament, equality and inclusion. It is also a fundamental question in terms of reaching our main goal of preventing conflict and human suffering.  (spoke in English)  Over the past year, we have seen positive examples ofprogress. Women's organizations continue to have an impact, from keeping dialogue alive in Guinea Bissau to rebuilding communities in Colombia. In the Central African Republic and Mali, women successfully contributed to negotiating between armed actors to halt the escalation of intercommunal tensions. In the Syrian Arab Republic, women have negotiated local ceasefires, mediated the creation of civilian safe zones and coordinated humanitarian and relief initiatives; they have done similarly in Yemen.  I can personally attest to the critical importance of the work done by the women peacemakers I have met around the world, from Mali to Bangladesh. Here at the United Nations, the Women's Peace and Humanitarian Fund is channeling resources to women's organizations that need them. The Peacebuilding Fund invests more than 30 per cent of its resources in gender equality programming, and a growing number of donors are earmarking funds for gender equality.  We are placing this agenda at the heart of our partnerships with regional organizations. The Deputy Secretary-General has made several high-level missions with the African Union, focused on women, peace and security and development. Last month, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Dr. Denis Mukwege and Ms. Nadia Murad, two champions of women, peace and security who exemplify the power of individuals to make a difference and the fact that survivors and advocates are best placed to determine the changes needed to build sustainable peace.  But despite this progress in some areas, the facts on the ground show that we still have far to go. The participation of women in formal peace processes remains extremely limited. Between 1990 and 2017, women constituted just 2 per cent of mediators, 8 per cent of negotiators and 5 per cent of witnesses and signatories in all major peace processes. Conflict continues to have a devastating effect on women and girls. The United Nations documented more than 800 cases of conflict-related sexual violence in 2017 - a 56 per cent increase since 2016.  Women human rights defenders, political leaders, journalists and activists, who play an important role in addressing the root causes of conflict, are targeted at alarming rates. Women's marginalization, lack of access to health and education services, and economic disempowerment continue to be both a cause and an effect of conflict. Funding for programmes to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women in countries affected by conflict is just 5 per cent of total bilateral aid to such countries.  The evidence linking gender equality and peace was recently set out in our joint study with the World Bank, Pathways for Peace: Inclusive Approaches to Preventing Violent Conflict. It is convincing and well- known. Maybe that is why the list of speakers for this debate is so long every year In 2015, the open debate on this item had the highest number of speakers in the history of the Security Council (see S/PV.7533).  But there is a significant gap between what we say in this Chamber and what we do outside it. Every year, we make laudable commitments, but they are not backed with the requisite financial and political support. We repeat statistics about the sustainability of inclusive peace processes, but that is not how we mediate most conflicts. We extol the positive influence of women peacebuilders, but provide little space for their participation. We rely heavily on women's organizations, but do not fund them adequately. We recognize the importance of gender analysis, but out the budgets for such expertise. To address this gap, I intend to prioritize several action points in the coming year.  First, gender parity has the greatest potential impact on effectiveness and credibility in our field operations. But this is where the numbers are lowest, and the rate of change is slowest. Women now comprise 41 per cent of heads and deputy heads of our peace operations - more than ever before. Their differing perspectives are already having a positive impact, but the number of women in peace operations overall has stagnated. Without decisive action, they will go backwards as some missions are downsized. I have therefore formed a working group to put emergency measures in place to address this issue. Some elements will need approval from Member States, and I hope the commitment of the participants in this Chamber today will be reflected in their support for these reforms when we seize the General Assembly to change some of our rules and regulations.  It is also crippling to our credibility and protection-capacity that women represent only 4 per cent of our military peacekeepers and 10 per cent of police. The United Nations fully supports the innovative efforts launched by Member States this year to incentivize greater representation.  I remain committed to ending all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse within the United Nations - one of the first initiatives I took when I assumed office. I will continue to work with my Special Coordinator on Improving the United Nations Response to Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, the Victims' Rights Advocate and Member States on this issue. I am pleased that nearly 100 Member States have now signed voluntary compacts with us to tackle sexual exploitation and abuse, and I call on others to join them. The Circle of Leadership of Heads of State and Government is committed to zero tolerance, to preventing and ending this scourge and to addressing its impact effectively and humanely.  Secondly, with respect to mediation, we know that the meaningful participation of women is directly linked to more sustainable peace. And yet we continue to support and lead processes that are not inclusive. The establishment of several women's networks in recent years is an important trend, as they can play a role in influencing processes for the better. I am pleased that members of my High-Level Advisory Board on Mediation - which is gender-balanced to the level of full parity - are here this week to work with representatives of these networks. Women's participation should not be confined to advisory roles or parallel structures, and I welcome the growing sense of urgency from Member States, civil society and others to ensure that we are designing more effective peace processes with much stronger women's participation.  Thirdly, a gendered approach to peace and security means supporting peacebuilding at the local level, even during conflict. As peace processes falter at the national and international level, we must consistently support the local women's groups that negotiate humanitarian access and support community resilience, learn from them and build peace from the ground up.  Fourthly, financing this agenda is critical, and the United Nations intends to lead by example. I have created a high-level task force to review our funding on gender equality, including in the peace and security pillar. I will hold United Nations entities accountable with respect to their commitments to increasing spending on women and peace and security, with a target of reaching or exceeding 15 per cent by 2020.  Finally, from now on I will include gender analysis in my reports to the Security Council whenever it is relevant to inform its decisions.  In two years' time, we will mark the twentieth anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000), the fifth anniversary of the global agreement giving rise to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration. Gender equality and women's participation are a unifying thread running through the implementation of these landmark agreements for human rights, sustainable development, and peace and security. In preparation for these landmark dates, my report on women and peace and security next year will include an assessment of implementation of the relevant recommendations in the three peace and security reviews undertaken in 2015, particularly the Global Study on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), together with resolution 2242 (2015), adopted three years ago. The findings and recommendations from this assessment will be the basis for increased efforts in the year leading up to 2020. I encourage Member States to initiate similar preparations and reviews.  As we look forward, I urge the Security Council to invest in gender equality and women's empowerment, not only as an end in themselves, but as a critical means of achieving our overarching aim of preventing and ending conflict and building peace and prosperity in the world for all.

In two years' time, we will mark the twentieth anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000), the fifth anniversary of the global agreement giving rise to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration. Gender equality and women's participation are a unifying thread running through the implementation of these landmark agreements for human rights, sustainable development, and peace and security. In preparation for these landmark dates, my report on women and peace and security next year will include an assessment of implementation of the relevant recommendations in the three peace and security reviews undertaken in 2015, particularly the Global Study on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), together with resolution 2242 (2015), adopted three years ago. The findings and recommendations from this assessment will be the basis for increased efforts in the year leading up to 2020. I encourage Member States to initiate similar preparations and reviews.  As we look forward, I urge the Security Council to invest in gender equality and women's empowerment, not only as an end in themselves, but as a critical means of achieving our overarching aim of preventing and ending conflict and building peace and prosperity in the world for all.

UNSC_2019_SPV.8508_spch002.txt,2019,8508,"The Secretary-General: I welcome this debate on women in peacekeeping as we strive for progress on a key element in the maintenance of international peace and security.  With the launch of the system-wide strategy on gender parity, in 2017, the United Nations embarked upon an ambitious and essential system-wide effort to enhance women's representation at all levels and in all arenas. A key priority is to increase the number of women in peacekeeping - both civilian and uniformed - which is where we need the most improvement. This is not just a question of numbers, but also of our effectiveness in fulfilling our mandates.  Evidence shows that greater numbers of women peacekeepers lead to protection responses that are more credible and meet the needs of all members of local communities. Women in patrol units are better able to reach both men and women in areas of operation, accessing critical intelligence and providing a more holistic View of the security challenges. The presence of women at checkpoints has been credited with promoting a less confrontational atmosphere, and more women in troop contingents is credited with higher reporting of sexual and gender-based violence and lower incidences of sexual exploitation and abuse.  Equally, access to women's networks can enable female peacekeepers to consult with a broader section of the population, who may have very different requirements and perspectives on sustainable peace. This lays the ground for another shared goal: more representative and inclusive peace processes. As we approach the twentieth anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, we need to do far more to ensure that women's rights, women's voices and women's participation are at the centre of peacekeeping decision-making. This is central to sustainable solutions in all the contexts in which we work.  Through resolution 2242 (2015), on women and peace and security, adopted in 2015, the Security Council called on us to double the numbers of women in military and police components of United Nations peacekeeping operations by 2020 and to review the barriers to their recruitment and advancement. We are pressing forward on those goals.  The Action for Peacekeeping initiative calls for the full, equal and meaningful participation of women at all stages of peace processes, as well as the integration of a gender perspective into all stages of analysis, planning, implementation and reporting. I thank the more than 150 Member States that have signed on to that commitment. I also thank those Member States that launched the Elsie Initiative on Women in Peace Operations at last week's Peacekeeping Ministerial on overcoming barriers to increasing women's meaningful participation in peace operations.  The Action for Peacekeeping Initiative builds on the numerous policies and strategies of the United Nations aimed at strengthening performance, accountability and the implementation of women and peace and security mandates. In support of our commitments in those areas, we have undertaken a range of actions to support and promote women's involvement in our operations.  Last year, we launched the gender-responsive peacekeeping operations policy, which commits us to promoting leadership and accountability both for gender equality and for the women and peace and security agenda. For civilian personnel, each field mission has developed its own gender-parity strategies, and our leadership in the field is more than 40 per cent female. I have also established a working group on emergency measures for gender parity in peace operations, to tackle some of the specific challenges we have identified in recruiting and retaining women in field environments, including in our rules and regulations. They include addressing conditions in missions to provide more suitable accommodation, facilities, lighting and health facilities.  We must also strive to ensure that the rosters from which we recruit are gender-balanced and that the gains we have secured in recruitment in recent years are not eroded during the downsizing of missions. A set of proposals in that regard have already been presented to the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly.  This year we rolled out the uniformed gender-parity strategy, which builds on the commitment established in resolution 2242 (2015) and goes further, calling for more than just a doubling of numbers. Targets for women's representation range from 15 per cent to 35 per cent by 2028, inclusive of military, police and justice and corrections personnel. The achievement of those targets will represent a significant step towards parity. Since December 2015, the number of women in uniform has increased by approximately 1 per cent. That is clearly not enough. But there are some notable gains on which we can build.  The number of women staff officers and military observers has almost doubled since the first Peacekeeping Ministerial in November 2017, with women now representing more than 13 per cent of deployed personnel. Also since that first meeting, 27 countries that had previously not deployed any women at all now do so. And 30 more countries have deployed more than 15 per cent women military observers and staff officers, bringing the total number of countries to 48.  Among police personnel, the representation of women has increased by 300 - more than 3 per cent - since the 2017 Peacekeeping Ministerial. Nine per cent of personnel in formed police units are now women. Furthermore, the number of female heads of United Nations police components in the field has increased, including in Abyei, Cyprus, Darfur and South Sudan.  Our uniformed gender-parity strategy also sets targets for uniformed corrections and justice officers in the field. However, that area has been more challenging  We in the Secretariat will continue to press ahead in all those areas. But to keep on track, we need assistance from Member States: first, through increased nominations of women officers and, secondly, a sharper focus on women in battalions and formed police units. I also appeal to Member States and their capitals to do their utmost to meet the targets in the uniformed gender-parity strategy, not only through pledges but, more important, through the sustained recruitment and deployment of women within their national services.  I am pleased that we are very close to gender parity in the senior leadership of the United Nations for the first time in the history of the Organization, and well ahead of my 2021 commitment - but that is an area where I can decide alone. I am committed to sustaining that progress, which makes clear that what is needed ultimately is political will and persistence. We need to bring the same spirit to our peace operations. This is crucial for our effectiveness, credibility and reputation. We count on Member States' sustained support.

UNSC_2019_SPV.8514_spch002.txt,2019,8514,"The Secretary-General: I thank Germany and His Excellency the Foreign Minister, Mr. Heiko Maas, for hosting this important debate. I welcome Nobel Peace Prize laureates Ms. Nadia Murad and Dr. Denis Mukwege and thank them for their extraordinary work. Their advocacy highlights two vital elements of our response to the crime of sexual violence in conflict: the call for justice and the need for support and assistance to victims. While their efforts originate in Iraq and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, they have a global impact. The United Nations is proud to work with victims and survivors to support the movements that they have started. I also welcome Ms. Inas Miloud and Ms. Amal Clooney and thank them for their activism and advocacy.  It is 10 years since the establishment ofthe mandate and the Office of the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict. Over the course of the decade, there has been a paradigm shift in the understanding of the crime of conflict-related sexual violence, its impact on international peace and security, the response required to prevent and end it, and the full range of services required by survivors. That is the result of advocacy and action by individuals, Governments, non-governmental organizations and institutions. I commend all those involved, including the Council, which has established a robust normative framework to address the issue. An increasing number of Governments have shown a willingness to pursue justice and provide services for survivors. Advocacy groups have demonstrated beyond doubt that sexual violence is deliberately used as a tactic of war to terrorize people, dehumanize communities and destabilize societies so that they struggle to recover for years or even decades.  Local civil society organizations, many of them women's organizations, are at the forefront of our efforts to prevent this crime and to provide redress for it, and they deserve our strong and consistent support. Individual heroes, including those with us today, have shown great courage in speaking out on the enormous and lasting damage done by the crime, which is most often perpetrated against women and girls.  The United Nations system has stepped up by taking action to implement the resolutions passed by the Council on women and peace and security. To give just a few examples, United Nations peacekeepers now receive consistent training to prevent and to respond to sexual violence in conflict. We have strengthened our ability to investigate crimes of sexual and gender- based violence, deploying dedicated investigators to United Nations commissions of inquiry and to national and international courts. We have improved our data and analysis of such crimes - an essential basis for successful prevention. And we are supporting Governments to improve their response and services for survivors.  Despite all those efforts, the reality on the ground has not changed. Sexual violence continues to be a horrific feature of conflicts around the world.  Throughout my career, I have heard first-hand accounts of sexual violence in war zones, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the former Yugoslavia. In Bangladesh last year, Rohingya refugees told me of the gang rape of women and girls in their homes before they fled Myanmar. That is why the President of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, and I pledged earlier this year to step up efforts to prevent and end such crimes and to put victims and survivors at the centre of our response. At the same time, we urged Governments to do more to address the issue and to support survivors.  We must recognize that sexual violence in conflict largely affects women and girls because it is closely linked to broader issues of gender inequality and discrimination. Prevention must therefore be based on promoting women's rights and gender equality in all areas before, during and after conflict. That must include women's full and effective participation in political, economic and social life and ensuring accessible and responsive justice and security institutions.  We must also recognize that there are links between sexual violence in conflict, gender inequality and discrimination and violent extremism and terrorism. Extremists and terrorists often build their ideologies around the subjugation of women and girls and use sexual violence in various ways, from forced marriage to virtual enslavement. Sexual violence continues to fuel conflict and severely impacts the prospects for lasting peace.  My report (S/2019/280) outlines a series of recommendations that are intended to provide a comprehensive approach to conflict-related sexual violence. Prevention is a strong theme running through the recommendations. I encourage the Council to include the prevention of conflict-related sexual violence in all its country-specific resolutions and in the mandates of peace operations. I also encourage the Council to integrate the issue of conflict-related sexual violence fully into the work of its sanctions committees and to include measures to prevent these crimes in its initiatives on security sector and justice reform. Strengthening prevention in the context of the Council's peacemaking efforts is also critical.  Where women are part of peacekeeping missions, we know that reporting on and protection from sexual violence increase. When women are at the peace table, there is greater likelihood of accountability for these crimes. When women are part of ceasefire monitoring, they can ensure that gender-based crimes are monitored and reported. My recommendations also stress the need to strengthen justice and accountability. Despite a handful of high-profile convictions, there is widespread impunity for sexual violence in conflict. Most of these crimes are never reported or investigated, much less prosecuted. My recommendations include increasing support to national authorities as they reform laws, improve their capacities to investigate and prosecute these crimes and protect survivors who testify from stigma and fear of reprisal. They also emphasize the need for greater support for survivors and their families, including health care, reparations and other assistance.  I commend the efforts of Dr. Mukwege to create a global fund to support victims and call on all Member States to contribute so that the fund can transform the lives ofthose affected and provide a measure ofredress.  I thank the members of the Council for their leadership over the past decade. This agenda has benefitted from both the commitment and the consensus of Council members, and I encourage Council members to continue working together to reconcile differences. The global response to these crimes must ensure the punishment of the perpetrators and comprehensive support to survivors, in full respect for their human rights. Together, we can and must replace impunity with justice and indifference with action.

UNSC_2019_SPV.8649_spch008.txt,2019,8649,"The Secretary-General: The women and peace and security agenda is clearly one of the top priorities of the United Nations as a whole. We see that in the adoption of a great many resolutions by the Security Council, including landmark resolution 1325 (2000) and its many follow-up decisions. We see it in the global recognition of the central role that women must play in preventing and resolving conflicts. And we see it when we gather to discuss the issue. That is always when the Chamber is at its fullest and the list of speakers is the longest. We have exactly that same situation today.  Given such strong support and common understanding, an observer might be forgiven for thinking that things are substantially improving. But the sad fact is - and we must be blunt about it - that the commitment that is always reflected around this table is not translating into real change around the world. It is not coming fast enough or far enough. Change is coming at a pace that is too slow for the women and girls whose lives depend on it, and for the effectiveness of our efforts to maintain international peace and security.  Nearly two decades after resolution 1325 (2000) was adopted, women still face exclusion from many peace and political processes. Peace agreements are adopted without provisions that consider the needs and priorities of women and girls. A pitifully small 0.2 per cent of bilateral aid to fragile and conflict-affected situations goes to women's organizations. The number of attacks against women human rights defenders, humanitarians and peacebuilders continues to increase. Sexual and gender-based violence continues to be used as a weapon of war, with the survivors of such violence often left without justice or support. This year alone, millions of women and girls were in need of life-saving sexual and reproductive health services, and millions more required interventions to prevent sexual and gender-based violence. There is also a growing number of armed groups for which gender inequality is a strategic objective, and misogyny part of their core ideology. And, of course, we know that women and girls continue to suffer the consequences of conflict in general. To cite just one example, in north-east Syria, we saw thousands of women and children fleeing the latest violence. But despite this grim litany, we will not give up. This, for me, is an absolute priority.  We can report at least some progress. In Yemen, where women were absent from the formal rounds of consultations, my Special Envoy established a Yemeni women's technical advisory group to ensure that the perspectives of Yemeni women are included. In Guinea-Bissau, women played a direct role in breaking the political impasse last year, supported by the Peacebuilding Fund. They led unprecedented mobilization for parity laws requiring a minimum of 36 per cent of women on the ballot, and they were key to the success of the elections this year. There were record numbers of women candidates and voters, and the country achieved parity among ministerial posts. In Syria, women make up approximately 30 per cent ofthe new Constitutional Committee, including some from the Women's Advisory Board that has been working for peace all these years.  Within the United Nations itself, the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and the Department of Peace Operations are implementing a new and stronger policy on women and peace and security. All heads of special political missions and my Special Envoys have  been instructed to report regularly on their efforts to promote women's direct participation throughout all stages of peace processes, in ways that ensure they have influence over the outcomes. An objective related to women and peace and security has now been included in all senior managers' compacts related to peace and security mandates. In our peacekeeping operations, we are working to end sexual exploitation and abuse and increase women's participation. Incidents of sexual exploitation and abuse have been reduced by half, and we are finally moving the needle on the percentage of women in the military and the police components of our operations. I have appointed many more women as heads and deputy heads of missions, and we are pursuing emergency measures to achieve gender balance.  Women and peace and security is one of the eight priority pillars of our Action for Peacekeeping initiative, endorsed now by more than 150 countries. I have also requested peacekeeping and special political missions to improve their monitoring and reporting of threats and violence against activists, including women human rights defenders, and for that to be built into early warning signs of escalating conflict or instability. Without a gender analysis, we are operating on partial information and are unable to anticipate and respond effectively to early warnings.  Today we recognize both progress and how much more we must do. When we fall short, women, girls and all members of society suffer the consequences.

UNSC_2019_SPV.8657_spch002.txt,2019,8657,"The Deputy Secretary-General: I thank you, Madam President, for the invitation to brief the Security Council on my recent joint mission with the African Union (AU) to Ethiopia, Djibouti, Eritrea and Somalia. This is the fourth visit I have undertaken focused on women, peace and security and development, and the thirdjoint solidarity mission with the African Union. I am pleased that Ambassador Fatima Kyari Mohammed is here to brief alongside me.  At the request of the Prime Minister, I also travelled with senior United Nations officials to the Sudan, to focus on support for the transition, the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) and women's leadership. Those missions are an opportunity to strengthen implementation of our shared United Nations-AU frameworks on peace and security, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Agenda 2063 of the African Union and the Silencing the Guns in Africa by 2020 initiative.  I would like to commend the leadership of Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat as well as that of Ms. Bineta Diop, AU Special Envoy on Women, Peace and Security, who led the AU delegation.  In each country, we met Heads of State, ministers, senior women Government officials, civil society members, the international community and our United Nations country teams and peacekeeping missions. I left all five countries with a sense ofhope and optimism. The chance for peace in this region is very real. The international community, together with these countries, can find lasting solutions to the complex challenges of the region.  Each country is moving at its own pace through a process of reform and transformation. And in all countries, women are playing a critical leadership role in social cohesion, economic revival and peace. The leaders of these countries are making concrete efforts to place gender equality and greater representation of women at the heart of reforms in order to reap the benefits of the links between inclusion, stability and peace, and to give substance to prevention efforts during these complex transitions.  Ethiopia now has its first woman President, and half its Government ministers are women. Together they hold some of the most significant decision-making portfolios in the country. The President is leading efforts towards social cohesion. Women serve as the Ministers of Peace, Labour and Infrastructure and are at the helm of the National Electoral Commission and the Supreme Court. The Government programme includes far-reaching legal reforms for greater gender equality. All of this was cited by the Nobel Committee when it awarded Prime Minister Ahmed the Nobel Peace Prize last month. I also met with the Mothers for Peace initiative, which is working across communities to repair the social fabric of the country, and with women who have served as United Nations peacekeepers. I note that Ethiopia is our largest troop-contributing country.  In Somalia, we met the Prime Minister and dynamic female ministers who are introducing reforms to address the challenges of women's low representation in political life. We heard from women in civil society who are on the front lines of preventing the spread of violent extremism. We also met with the head of the National Independent Electoral Commission, who has a challenging task ahead of her. Our efforts in Somalia must prioritize financial support to free, fair and inclusive elections next year, as well as to the national development priorities of the Government, including debt relief. There are islands of stability in the country that can be built upon, but that will require more central Government cooperation with federal member states, as well as a road map for transitionaljustice and social reintegration.  In Eritrea, one of the few countries in the world where women fought in significant numbers on the front lines of the independence movement, gender equality and women's leadership are seen as an unquestioned reality. We met with young women entrepreneurs and saw the investments in critical infrastructure - from multipurpose dams to solar power to roads that will reintegrate the country with the region. Relations between Eritrea and its neighbours are nascent, but they are making strides. There is a unique opportunity at this moment for the international community to support greater integration and sustainable peace.  In Djibouti, we met with local women who have built community centres to care for children with disabilities and to support refugee and migrant women, in a context where many young women are fleeing conflict or migrating in search of a better life, only to become victims of human trafficking and horrendous abuse. The country has recently passed legislation that increases maternity leave and provides for greater protection from violence, gender parity in the civil service and the private sector and a quota for women in Parliament.  In the Sudan, I met some of the women who were the engine of the revolution and are now demanding equality and social inclusion across all strata of society.  All ofthat reinforces the need for us to question our own narrative and mindsets. The region I saw has some of the fastest-growing economies on the continent, with rich natural resources, extraordinary capacity, particularly among their youth, and genuine reforms. Those are the elements that we need to support and the narrative that we need to share.  The road ahead for the Horn of Africa will not be easy. The foundations have been laid for a transition from peace to sustainable development. But building on these fragile foundations will require unity and cooperation across the region and common ground internationally to accompany those transitions. That is particularly true when it comes to the issue of refugees and internally displaced persons, of which there are tens of thousands, many of whom are vulnerable to trafficking, as well as in finding regional solutions to protection challenges, including sexual violence, in areas where conflict is still going on.  It was clear from our travels that the whole region is cut from the same fabric. Each country is its own shade, but they are interwoven. What happens in one country will impact the others, and therefore regional approach and genuine collaboration are paramount. In that regard, I am encouraged by the signs of the revitalization of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development. This platform will be essential to providing the necessary pathways we can all support. That is also the reason that it was important that it was a joint mission with the African Union. In working together, we can achieve so much more. As one Government official said to us, the joint mission has changed the nature of the relationship with both the United Nations and the AU, in terms of the quality and content of the dialogue. What is needed now is to maintain and deepen that dialogue and partnership, and to use them to encourage regional solutions and unity.  Finally, I wish to turn to the Sudan. Last week, the Council heard from an amazing young woman, Alaa Salah, whose image became synonymous with the protests in Khartoum (see S/PV.8649). I met Alaa, along with three other women civil society activists - Huda Shafig, Safaa Adam and Samah Mohamed - in New York, after talking to their compatriots in Khartoum and El Fasher. Thanks to the efforts of these amazing women and thousands more like them, the Sudan is seeing a new dawn. We must be ready to support the people and the Government through a successful transition that lays the foundations for truly inclusive elections and sustained peace.  I welcome the recent unanimous extension by the Council of UNAMID's mandate for one more year and its decision to include in that mandate support for the peace process and peacebuilding activities. During my visit to El Fasher and in meetings with women from local communities, they made it clear that a premature drawdown could leave a security vacuum, thereby exposing them to greater violence and putting at risk progress towards economic stability.  We have just taken part in a whole-of-system Visioning exercise with the Sudanese Government that will enable us to respond to the changing context and support the Sudan's priorities over the next three years of the transition. The exercise establishes a vision for our partnership with the Sudanese people, our support to those leading the transition - the Forces for Freedom and Change, the Sovereign Council and the transitional Government - and the national development plan that they have jointly developed. Our responses will sequence immediate and longer-term activities, in alignment with the priorities set by the Government. Those priorities include the peace process, economic and social development, economic reforms, the reintegration of internally displaced persons and comprehensive transitional justice and reconciliation.  These are tall orders and, while they need to be delivered urgently, expectations must also be managed. I urge the Council, and the international community more broadly, to assist in identifying concrete actions that can be delivered in the short term over the next three months, while maintaining momentum and addressing the medium- and long-term opportunities necessary for lasting peace.  At the same time, the Government is committed to addressing root causes. I cannot put it better than the Sudanese Minister who told me:  ""It is not peace documents that are missing in [the] Sudan. We have shelves of beautifully worded peace agreements since independence. We need to address the root causes - exclusion, human rights, marginalization and underdevelopment. We need a Marshall Plan for areas of our country and the support of the international community to deliver this.""  Responding to the opportunity in the Sudan will require putting aside our usual ways of working. Investment in development must accompany the transition if it is to take root and flourish. Continuous efforts in a wide range of critical areas, such as delisting and debt relief, will be urgently needed to give the Sudan a fresh start, as will creative solutions for domestic resources and external investments, including tax reforms and the recovery of stolen assets.  While they are moving at different speeds, each country in the region is heading in the right direction. We must seize this opportunity to invest and support peace and promote women's participation and leadership, education, peace dividends, free and fair elections and the short-term, high-impact projects that reach those who are farthest behind.  Having met with our United Nations staff in each country, I can attest to their courage, sacrifice, commitment, motivation, and willingness to walk this road together in support of the collective goals of national counterparts. That includes everything from the United Nations Office to the African Union personnel, who are leading our partnership with the African Union on peace and security, to the innovative efforts ofthe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime on trafficking in the region, the UN-Women's work towards mobilizing and supporting women's demands, the United Nations Development Programme's role in sustainable development, the Economic Commission for Africa's efforts at strengthening economies, and all those who serve in our country team under the leadership of our Resident Coordinators, alongside the critical work of our peacekeeping and political missions. With the solidarity and support of the international community, those countries can overcome their challenges and become an anchor for growth and stability within the broader region and the African continent.  Finally, I would like to pay tribute to our peacekeepers and specifically mention our women in peacekeeping. In each of the countries that we visited, the critical importance of women serving in security forces, the police, the military and in peacekeeping was starkly clear. Those women, against all odds, strengthen our protection efforts, increase the credibility of our endeavours, engage in local-level mediation and make communities feel much more at ease. And yet we continue to deploy less than four per cent female peacekeepers. Much more can and should be done. Women shared their practical challenges with us. Even where they are enrolled in their national security services, they are often not provided with the opportunities needed to be deployed - from map- reading to specific driving and computer skills. When they are deployed, they often contend with harassment or are asked to serve tea and coffee rather than patrol communities. The kits we provide do not fit the needs of women. In contexts such as that of Somalia, where head-covering is needed, that is left to the individual women to secure. And while this may be the first time that these words have been said in the Security Council, sanitary pads are a basic necessity for women and yet do not form part of their deployment kits.  As the Security Council returns to the open debate on women and peace and security this afternoon, I hope that these issues will be among those discussed. I humbly urge the Council to heed the winds of change, so that we may continue to strive towards peace in all hearts and in all nations.

UNSC_2019_SPV.8657_spch022.txt,2019,8657,"The Deputy Secretary-General: I would like to once again express my deep appreciation to the Security Council for giving us this opportunity to share what I think was not just a visit to the region but one that left us with a lot of homework to do when we came back, particularly considering that the Council is underscoring the urgency with which we need to see actions at scale to support the Horn of Africa. I would also like to add my voice to the congratulations on the leadership of our colleague from South Africa during his presidency in October. It was an important month for women and peace and security, and beyond that the Security Council's visit was critical to reinforcing our presence in the Horn of Africa, and now under your leadership for November, Madam President, we are starting off with a resumption of the open debate on women and peace and security.  We have had a number of initiatives proposed in the United Nations since we have been discussing the visit with our colleagues and asking what more we can do. First, with regard to very specific issues that were raised during the visit, our peacekeeping departments are already looking at what we can do with regard to the uniform list and the kits being issued, for instance. That is already something that we can take cognizance of. But what is important is how to get better feedback, such as this, that does not have to wait for a visit. I think that is what concerned us most. We should not have to wait for a visit to be aware of such challenges.  The capacity-building that we are providing is insufficient, and we need more of it for women peacekeepers. They need support in the cases where they have not had specific training 4 for example, the centres that our Ethiopian peacekeepers referred to, saying that they need more of that, and that we need to identify and map the whole range of relevant skill gaps. In our missions too, it would be helpful to have support for positions that are focused on better understanding those gender-specific aspects. We therefore want to encourage Member States, as they consider the resources envelope, to put more into that. It does not take very much, but it is not there right now.  In addition, peacekeeping has many trained mediators who are women, but we do not have the resources to deploy them, or the kinds of checks and balances that we need to determine the complement of women engaged in those negotiations right from the outset, when the seeds are being sown. We all have a role to play in that by asking those questions and trying to push the envelope further in order to see women at the table from the very beginning. That was particularly applicable in the Sudan, where peace negotiations have started, and the response to us was that they had only just started, they were not there yet and would include women eventually. But women need to be there from the very start. I think that was something that the Prime Minister was very enthusiastic and supportive of, but I believe that the rest of the community around the table should take it up quite quickly.  In other places, again concerning peacekeepers, some of the issues were from the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), which has more than 1,000 peacekeepers. The feedback we received in that regard, as we manage and support that Mission, was that we also need to be aware of some of the needs.  Regarding girls' education, which is a tremendously important part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Agenda 2063, without which we will not silence the guns, we must have educated young people, particularly women and girls, whether as part of the basic right to education at the beginning, second- chance education or a renewal of skills, which we found among a number of adolescent girls who would like to join the marketplace and to be a better empowered to take such decisions not just for themselves but also since they impact the community. That reinforces what we saw in the cases of the Sudan and Eritrea, namely, that really looking at their plans and how inclusive the curriculum was of girls entering education was important. We continue to reinforce that.  The decade of action for the delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals is approaching. I think that this is something that requires that we undertake much more analysis and planning, taking into account the current context. Prevention and transitions are lenses that we look through in Africa in particular regarding girls' education. On the one hand, it is prevention but, on the other hand, there are very many girls and women who have been kept out of the space of being empowered, particularly through education. As we look towards the strategy for the Horn of Africa and for the plan in the Sudan, it is an important area of planning, including to see the investment that is going to be made in the line item that we put for girls' education.  I am not sure if there were any more questions that were asked, but we are following this up. Agency by agency, it also becomes a matter for the United Nations development system as well.
