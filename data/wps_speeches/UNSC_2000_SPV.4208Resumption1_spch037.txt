The President: I thank the representative of
Belarus for the kind words he addressed to my country.

A number of speakers remain on my list. In view
of the lateness of the hour, and with the concurrence of
the members of the Security Council, I intend to
suspend the meeting now, and to resume it tomorrow,
Wednesday, 25 October 2000, at 10.30 am.

The meeting was suspended at 6.25 p.m.
