The President: I thank Ms. King for her kind
words addressed to my country and to me.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is Ms.
Noeleen Heyzer, Executive Director of the United
Nations Development Fund for Women, to whom the
Council has extended an invitation under rule 39 of its
provisional rules of procedure. I give her the floor.
