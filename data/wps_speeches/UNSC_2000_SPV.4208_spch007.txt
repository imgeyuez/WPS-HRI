The President: I thank Ms. Heyzer for her kind
words addressed to me.

I should like to inform the Council that I have
received letters from the representatives of Botswana
and Rwanda in which they request to be invited to
participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda.

In accordance with the usual practice, I propose,
with the Council's consent, to invite those
representatives to participate in the discussion without
the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Legwaila
(Botswana) and Mr. Mutaboba (Rwanda) took the
seats reservedfor them at the side of the Council
Chamber.
