The President: I should perhaps note that for the
first time that I can remember, there is a majority of
women representing delegations in the Security
Council. For a fleeting moment, there were nine
representatives. I was wondering whether anybody
would quickly put forward a resolution.

The next speaker on my list is the representative
of Japan. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table
and to make his statement.
