Mr. Rosenblatt (United States): I regret that this
meeting should end on a note of discord. Let me just
say that I certainly agree with what was just said about
the importance and usefulness of this meeting. But I
must also say that we stand by the observation that
Ambassador Negroponte made earlier concerning the
lack of balance in addressing the effect on women of
one particular conflict, along with the statement of
concern regarding what is in fact a case of non-
implementation, on the part of one Government
represented here, of provisions of an important
Security Council resolution: resolution 1373 (2001).
