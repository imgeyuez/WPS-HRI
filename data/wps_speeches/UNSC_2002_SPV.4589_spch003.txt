The President: I thank Mr. Guehenno for that
important statement and pay tribute to the work the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) has
done in this area of gender mainstreaming. You got us
off to a good start for this debate.

I call on Ms. Angela King, Assistant Secretary-
General and Special Adviser on Gender Issues and
Advancement of Women.
