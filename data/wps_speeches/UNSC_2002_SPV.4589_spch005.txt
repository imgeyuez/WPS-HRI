The President: On behalf of the Council, I
should like to pay tribute to Ms. King and her whole
team in the Division for the Advancement of Women
for the work they are doing. We have already seen from
the first two interventions how various parts of the
Secretariat are interacting with one another on this
issue and are beginning to focus in on the same points.
I very much hope that Council members will take up
the points that Ms. King has made and that they will
use this opportunity to make their comments on where
we have gotten thus far in order to provide some input
into the Secretary-General's report, which is still under
preparation. It is an important point for an interactive
debate.
I now call on the Executive Director of the
United Nations Development Fund for Women, Ms.
Noeleen Heyzer.
