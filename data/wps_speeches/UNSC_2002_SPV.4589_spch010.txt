The President: Forgive me, but I do hope that
delegations will try to keep their remarks down to
around five minutes. I asked speakers at the beginning
to remain succinct, and we will not get through this
debate with interest unless we are sharp and pick up the
points which have been made by the speakers at the
beginning of the debate.
