Ms. King: Indeed, it is very important to have
live examples. Because we were somewhat limited, I
think we were a little reluctant to go into them, but the
study for the Secretary-General is replete with
examples. I would just mention the instance of the
women in Burundi who got together and drew up a list
of demands, and eventually - thanks to some United
Nations agencies, including UNDP and UNIFEM. and
the leader, who was Mr. Mandela - most of those
recommendations were included in the final agreement.

I would also mention the Somali women who
constituted themselves into a sixth clan because they
could not get into the main factions. They were very
successful in bringing together the warring clan leaders
at the peace table. Some of that has fallen apart, but
these are very significant issues.

I think members are well aware of and very au
fait with the question of the Mano River Peace
Women's Network and how those women brought
together the two presidents of Guinea and Sierra
Leone. In the case of Liberia and Sierra Leone, women
were also very successful in actually going out into the
fields, mountains and places were there were no roads
to persuade young child soldiers to lay down arms and
to be part of the disarmament process.

What one of the studies in South Africa showed
was that women tend to be less hierarchical. They also
tend to link up with local women's organizations. They
set role models for local women. The local women also
tend to be better conveyers of the message of peace
than some of the men. There are many others, but I am
sure that Noleen has some others. These are just some
of them.
