The President (spoke in French): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from
the representative of India, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Nambiar
(India), took a seat at the side of the Council
Chamber.

The President (spoke in French): The next
speaker inscribed on my list is the representative of
Bangladesh. I invite him to take a seat at the Council
table and to make his statement.
