The President (spoke in French): Before I give
the floor to the next speaker, I wish to inform Council
members that it is my intention to suspend the meeting
at 6 pm.

The next speaker on my list is the representative
of Liechtenstein. I invite him to take a seat at the
Council table and to make his statement.
