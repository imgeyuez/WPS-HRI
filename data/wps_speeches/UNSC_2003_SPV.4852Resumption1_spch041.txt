Ms. Smythe: I do not feel able to step into
Mr. Guehenno's shoes and answer the questions
directed at him.

I would like, however, to say that I recognize that
sensitivity on gender issues has taken hold. We in the
field would like to see verbal commitments translated
into real action. The support that we have received so
far has enabled us to come as far as we have.

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo in
particular, the question of elections is preoccupying
many women's groups, as well as civil society in
general. So we are very pleased to know that some
work has been done by your Government,
Mr. President, on women and political participation.
That is one of the issues that we will follow up very
quickly - as soon as I get back - so as to get more
information for my colleagues in the system, as well as
for people in the United States Embassy.

Perhaps we omitted to mention this morning that
one source of support that enabled us to do the amount
of work that we were able to do was the Office of
Ms. Angela King. From the outset, when there was no
Gender Adviser, her Office supplied much useful
advice to the gender office in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo. We are particularly grateful to Ms. King

and her team for that. We apologize for the omission in
our statement this morning.

Having made those comments, I would like to
add that we shall work very closely with
Mr. Guehenno's Office to supply any answers that may
be needed as a follow-up to this meeting.

I thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the
opportunity to speak here today.
