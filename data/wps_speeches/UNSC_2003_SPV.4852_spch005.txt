The President: I thank Ms. Smythe very much
for her comments and observations, and commend her
for the work that she has been doing. I know that I
speak for all Council members when I say how
valuable it is to us to be able to hear the first-hand
experience of one of the observers of this very
important issue in the field.

I shall now call on members of the Council. The
first speaker is Ms. Kerstin Miiller, Minister of State
for Foreign Affairs of Germany.
