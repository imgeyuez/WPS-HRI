The President: I want to say a word about the
structure for the remainder of our discussion.
Ambassador Negroponte had to depart to attend a
scheduled meeting with the Secretary-General, so he
will deliver the United States national statement at the
end of our discussion.

We are honoured to have two ministers with us
this morning. I would like to give them the floor, then
ask Mr. Guehenno and Ms. Smythe if they wish to
make any comments, at which time we will adjourn the
meeting and resume with the speaker's list at three
o'clock.

The next speaker inscribed on my list is the
Minister for Development Cooperation of the Kingdom
of the Netherlands, Her Excellency Ms. Agnes van
Ardenne. I invite her to take a seat at the Council table
and to make her statement.
