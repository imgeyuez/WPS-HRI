Mr. Guehenno: I would like first to thank all the
members of the Council and other speakers, who have
expressed strong support for our efforts to put gender
at the centre of peacekeeping efforts in conflict areas.

I want to address two specific points that were
raised, the first with respect to Afghanistan. I am
grateful that Germany raised the issue of the
importance of filling, as quickly as possible, the D-1
post in the United Nations Assistance Mission in
Afghanistan. We already have a P-4 in the Gender Unit
there. I think it is very important that we appoint the
right person to that D-1 post, and we are actually in the
process of re-advertising the post to make sure that we
get the right person for what is a challenging but
critical aspect of our mission in Afghanistan.

Several delegations stressed the importance of
reporting, and I could not agree more; this is the other
issue that I want to address. I think the more we can
report to the Council about the issues that have been
discussed this morning, the more we will prevent any
abuse - reporting has a deterrent value - and the
more we will be able to mobilize resources where they
are needed, whether to help women in disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration camps or to assist in
police training or in the range of issues that have been
discussed.

Good reporting requires a method and a
systematic approach. There, I believe that the gender
resource package that is now in the final stages of
development will help, because it will mean that all
mission personnel - whether military observers or
human rights officers - will be better guided. All
personnel in the mission will have better guidance and
therefore a more systematic approach in their reporting,
so that the Council will benefit from more
homogeneous and systematic information, which in
turn will make for better engagement by the Council.
