The President: Before I turn to the next speaker,
could I just remind all potential speakers that the
Council asked me at the start of the debate - and let
me repeat it now - to try to encourage interventions to
be no more than five minutes. Cooperation in that
regard would be very much appreciated.

I now give the floor to the Executive Director of
the United Nations Development Fund for Women,
Ms. Noeleen Heyzer.
