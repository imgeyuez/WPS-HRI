The President: Can I offer colleagues two simple
facts: we have 17 or 18 speakers, and we are averaging,
so far, eight and a half minutes per intervention. I did
ask that, at the Council's request, we try to keep it to
five. That is a degree of inflation we could do without,
so can I encourage those who are lining up to try and
shorten their statements, especially if there is a
prepared text.

The next speaker is the representative of Mali, to
whom I give the floor.
