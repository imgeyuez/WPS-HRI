The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached previously, I would like to
invite all future speakers to try to limit their statements
to five minutes, in order to enable the Council to carry
out its work expeditiously.

I know it is asking a lot, but we have a very
formidable list of potential contributors, and the debate
will go on for a long time. If speakers would please be
as concise as possible, I am sure everyone will be
appreciative. For anyone who has a lengthy
intervention, may I suggest that you please circulate it
and make a slightly shorter oral intervention, which
would, I think, be very helpful.
