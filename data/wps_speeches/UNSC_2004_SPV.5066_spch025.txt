The President: I would like, if I may, just to
interject three procedural points into the debate at this
stage. First, we will go on a little bit beyond 1 pm.
Secondly, I have 31 speakers still inscribed. I did say at
the beginning that I hope people will stick to five
minutes. The more people can do that, the more likely
we are to get through the entire list efficiently. Again,
if I could remind Council members that we will begin
at 3 pm. with a vote and, perhaps, a reading of a
Presidential Statement or two, if they are ready. But
this debate will start as soon as possible after that, and
I would hope certainly no later than 3.15 pm.

I now call on the representative of the
Netherlands.
