The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Israel, in which he requests to be
invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
discussion, without the right to vote, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37
of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, the
representative ofIsrael took the seat reservedfor
him at the side ofthe Council Chamber

The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached among Council members, I wish
to remind to all speakers to limit their statements to no
more than five minutes so as to enable the Council to
carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with
lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate the
texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version
when speaking in the Chamber. I would also like to
reiterate that in order to optimize the use of our time I
will not individually invite speakers to take seats at the
Council table. When a speaker takes the floor the
Conference Officer will seat the next speaker on the
list at the table. I thank you for your understanding and
cooperation.
