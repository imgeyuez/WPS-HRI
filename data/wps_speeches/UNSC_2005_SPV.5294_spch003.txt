The President: I thank the Deputy Secretary-
General, Ms. Louise Frechette, for her statement.

The Council will now have an opportunity to see
the video to which I referred in my opening remarks.

A video was projected on screen.

The President: I thank the United Nations
Development Fund for Women for presenting us with
that powerful video projection. We also often speak
about how to foster proactive approaches to women's
participation in decision-making processes and their
involvement in rebuilding their societies. Watching that
film, I think that we have seen that women can be
powerful negotiators and strong advocates for peace
and reconciliation.

One high-ranking United Nations official who is
also familiar with such experiences is the head of our
Organization's Department of Peacekeeping
Operations, Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie
Guehenno, to whom I am very pleased to give the
floor.
