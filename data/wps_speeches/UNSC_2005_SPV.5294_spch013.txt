The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached among Council members, I wish
to remind all speakers to kindly limit their statements
to no more than five minutes in order to enable the
Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate their text in writing and to
deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.

Before opening up the floor to Council members,
it is my pleasure to acknowledge the presence here
today of a fine group of students from John C.
Whitehead School of Diplomacy and International
Relations. I am told that their professor, Mr. Courtney
Smith, accompanied them to the United Nations to
witness the celebration of the sixtieth anniversary of
our Organization and to observe the deliberations of
the Security Council. Let me say that we appreciate
their presence, and I hope they will find our
discussions pertinent and inspiring.
