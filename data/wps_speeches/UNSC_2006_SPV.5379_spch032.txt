Prince Zeid Ra'ad Zeid Al-Hussein: I too am
grateful to you, Mr. President, and to all those who
took the floor this morning for the kind remarks
addressed to my team and to me.

I, too, welcome the many constructive thoughts
and observations presented this morning by all my
colleagues who spoke, all of which will serve us well
as we press on in our work in the context of the
deliberations currently taking place in the General
Assembly.

The representatives of the Congo and Brazil
mentioned the acute sensitivities that ordinarily
accompany any discussion of this subject. I can attest
that, five years ago, this sort of debate would have
been absolutely impossible, and so I pay tribute to the
Permanent Representative of Denmark for having
arranged the Council's first formal meeting dedicated
to this subject last year. Yet, while a presidential
statement was issued on that occasion, the members of
the Council refrained from taking the floor
individually. And so, under your guidance, Sir, we are
breaking new ground.

That is welcome, for we must on occasion have
an open and responsible discussion of this troubling
subject in all forums within the United Nations system
and without prejudice to the General Assembly's
leading role on this. Again, Sir, I thank you and the
members of the Council for devoting some of your
valuable time and your much-appreciated thoughts to
this crucial subject.
