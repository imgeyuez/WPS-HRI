The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of Liechtenstein in which he requests to
be invited to participate in the consideration of the item
on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to
invite that representative to participate in the
consideration of the item, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter
and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, the
representative of Liechtenstein took the seat
reserved for him at the side of the Council
Chamber

The President: I remind all speakers to limit
their statements to no more than four minutes in order
to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing and to
deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber. I thank representatives in advance for their
cooperation.

I give the floor to Mrs. Christine Miturumbwe,
Coordinator of the Dushirehamwe Association.
