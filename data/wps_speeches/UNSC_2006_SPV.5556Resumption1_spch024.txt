The President: I thank the representative of
Bangladesh for his kind words addressed to the
presidency. I believe that it would also be
appropriate here for me to express our congratulations
to Bangladesh on the award to Mr. Muhammad Yunus
of the Nobel Peace Prize.

I now call on the representative of Spain.
