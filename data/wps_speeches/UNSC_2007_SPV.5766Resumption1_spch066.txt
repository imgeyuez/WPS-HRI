The President: After consultations among
members of the Security Council, I have been
authorized to make the following statement on behalf
of the Council:

"The Security Council reaffirms its
commitment to the full and effective
implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) on
women and peace and security and recalls the
relevant statements of its President as reiterating
that commitment.

"The Security Council reaffirms the
purposes and principles of the Charter of the
United Nations and the primary responsibility of
the Security Council under the Charter for the
maintenance of international peace and security.

"The Security Council recalls the 2005
World Summit Outcome (General Assembly resolution 60/1), the Beijing Declaration and
Platform for Action (A/CONF.177/20/Rev.l), the
outcome document of the twenty-third special
session of the General Assembly entitled 'Women
2000: gender equality, development and peace for
the twenty-first century' (A/S-23/10/Rev.l), in
particular the statements in these documents
concerning women and peace and security and
the Declaration of the forty-ninth session of the
Commission on the Status of Women on the
occasion of the tenth anniversary of the Fourth
World Conference on Women (E/CN.6/2005/l 1).

"The Security Council recognizes the
importance of ensuring the respect for the equal
rights of women and, in this regard, reaffirms the
importance of the equal role of women in the
prevention and resolution of conflicts and in
peacebuilding, and stresses the need for their full
and equal participation in peace processes at all
levels. The Council urges Member States,
regional and subregional organizations and the
United Nations system to enhance the role of
women in decision-making with regard to all
peace processes and post-conflict reconstruction
and rebuilding of societies as vital in all efforts
towards the maintenance and promotion of
sustainable peace and security.

"The Security Council is concerned that
armed and other types of conflicts still persist in
many parts of the world and are an ongoing
reality affecting women in nearly every region. In
this regard, the Council expresses deep concern
that civilians, particularly women and children,
continue to account for the vast majority of
victims of acts of violence committed by parties
to armed conflicts, including as a result of
deliberate targeting, indiscriminate and excessive
use of force. The Council condemns these acts
and demands that those parties immediately put
an end to such practices.

"The Security Council reaffirms in this
regard that parties to armed conflict bear the
primary responsibility to take all feasible steps to
ensure the protection of affected civilians, in
particular, giving attention to the specific needs
of women and girls.

"The Security Council recognizes the
constant underrepresentation of women in formal
peace processes and is deeply concerned about
persistent obstacles and challenges resulting from
situations such as violence against women,
shattered economies and social structures, lack of
rule of law, poverty, limited access to education
and other resources, various forms of
discrimination and stereotypes.

"The Security Council remains concerned
about the low number of women appointed as
special representatives or special envoys of the
Secretary-General to peace missions. The Council
urges the Secretary-General to appoint, taking
into account the principle of equitable
geographical representation, more women to
pursue good offices on his behalf. The Council
urges Member States to redouble their efforts to
nominate women candidates to the Secretary-
General for inclusion in a regularly updated
centralized roster. In turn, the Council calls on
the Secretary-General to increase the profile and
transparency of this procedure, and issue
guidelines to Member States on the process of
nomination to senior posts. In addition, the
Council reaffirms its call for broader gender
40

mainstreaming in all peacekeeping operations,
and welcomes United Nations peacekeeping
operations policies to promote and protect the
rights of women and to take into account a gender
perspective as set out in resolution 1325 (2000).

"The Security Council takes note of the
second follow-up report of the Secretary-General
on women, peace and security (S/2007/567), and
the various initiatives and actions undertaken by
the United Nations entities in the context of the
United Nations System-wide Action Plan on
implementation of Security Council resolution
1325 (2000); calls on the Secretary-General to
update, monitor and review the implementation
and integration of the Plan; conduct a system-
wide evaluation in 2010 of progress achieved in
implementing the Plan in 2008-2009; and report
thereon to the Council.

"While welcoming the progress achieved so
far, the Security Council recognizes the need for
full and more effective implementation of
resolution 1325 (2000).

"In this regard, the Security Council
reiterates its call on Member States to continue to
fully and effectively implement resolution 1325
(2000), including, where appropriate, through the
development and strengthening of national efforts
and capacities, as well as the implementation of
national action plans or other relevant national-
level strategies.

"The Security Council calls on the
international community to provide, where
needed, financial and technical support, as well
as adequate training, for national implementation
of resolution 1325 (2000), and on the United
Nations system, civil society and other relevant
actors to collaborate and provide assistance in
line with national priorities of Member States,
particularly those affected by armed conflict, in
the rapid development of national action plans,
and work closely with national mechanisms
responsible for the implementation of the
resolution, including, where appropriate, through
the United Nations country teams. To this end,
the Council requests the Secretary-General to
include in his annual report to the Council
information on progress on measures taken to
improve, where appropriate, the capacity of
relevant Member States to implement resolution
1325 (2000), including information on best
practices.

"The Council emphasizes the importance of
strengthening cooperation between Member
States as well as the United Nations entities and
regional organizations in adopting and promoting
regional approaches to the full implementation of
resolution 1325 (2000) in all its aspects.

"The Security Council strongly condemns
all violations of international law, including
international humanitarian law, human rights law
and refugee law, committed against women and
girls in situations of armed conflict, including
killing, maiming, sexual violence, exploitation
and abuse. In this regard, the Council urges the
complete cessation by all parties of such acts with
immediate effect.

"The Security Council is deeply concerned
that despite its repeated condemnation of all acts
of violence, including killing, maiming, sexual
violence, exploitation and abuse in situations of
armed conflict, and despite its calls addressed to
all parties to armed conflict for the cessation of
such acts with immediate effect, and for the
adoption of specific measures to protect women
and girls from gender-based Violence, particularly
rape, and other forms of sexual abuse, as well as
all other forms of violence, such acts remain
pervasive, and in some situations have become
systematic and have reached appalling levels of
atrocity. The Council stresses the need to end
impunity for such acts as part of a comprehensive
approach to seeking peace, justice, truth and
national reconciliation.

"In this context, the Council reiterates
paragraph 9 of resolution 1325 (2000) and calls
on all parties to armed conflict to respect fully
international law applicable to the rights and
protection of women and girls, especially as
civilians, in particular the obligations applicable
to them under the Geneva Conventions of 1949
and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977, the
Refugee Convention of 1951 and the Protocols
thereto of 1967, the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
against Women of 1979 and the Optional
Protocols thereto of 1999 and the United Nations
Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989
and the two Optional Protocols thereto of 25 May
2000, and to bear in mind relevant provisions of
the Rome Statute of the International Criminal
Court.

"The Security Council requests the
Secretary-General to include in his reporting to
the Council on situations of armed conflict
information on progress in gender mainstreaming
throughout the United Nations peacebuilding and
peacekeeping missions; data on the impact of
armed conflicts on women and girls, including
accounts of instances of all forms of violence
against women and girls, including killing,
maiming, grave sexual violence, abductions and
trafficking in persons, committed by the parties to
armed conflict; special measures proposed and
taken to protect women and girls from gender-
based violence, particularly rape, and other forms
of sexual abuse, and all other forms of violence in
situations of armed conflict, in order to end
impunity, ensure accountability and uphold a
zero-tolerance policy for violence against women
and girls.
"The Security Council requests the
Secretary-General to prepare a follow-up report
on the full implementation of resolution 1325
(2000), incorporating information on the impact
of armed conflicts on women and girls in
situations that are on the agenda of the Council,
and also information on their protection and on
the enhancement of their role in peace processes,
to be submitted to the Security Council in
October 2008, and may request the Secretary-
General to give an oral briefing on the progress
of the report.

"The Security Council decides to remain
actively seized of this matter."

This statement will be issued as a document of
the Security Council under symbol S/PRST/2007/40.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 7.10 pm.
