The President: In accordance with the
understanding reached among Council members, I wish
to remind all speakers to limit their statements to not
more than five minutes in order to enable the Council
to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with
lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate
their texts in writing and to deliver a condensed
version when speaking in the Chamber.

I invite Her Excellency Ms. Olga Algayerova,
State Secretary of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and
First Deputy Foreign Minister of the Slovak Republic,
to take the floor.
