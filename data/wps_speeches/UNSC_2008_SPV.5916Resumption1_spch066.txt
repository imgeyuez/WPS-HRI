Mr. Bodini (San Marino): I would like to thank
the Secretary of State of the United States of America,
Ms. Condoleezza Rice, and you, Mr. President, for
convening this important meeting today.

Over the years, the Republic of San Marino has
been a strong supporter of all campaigns against any
type of violence against women. As President of the
Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, our
Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Fiorenzo Stolfi,
spearheaded the Council of Europe campaign against
violence against women.

San Marino welcomes the now United Nations
initiative on this subject initiated by the Secretary-
General. In that context, we recently organized an
event here at the United Nations, linking the work of
the Council of Europe with the activities of this
Organization.

1 am happy to report that yesterday our
parliament adopted a very comprehensive law against
violence against women.
San Marino, a small country without an army, has
been able to maintain its independence for more than
17 centuries. We condemn war and violence in general,
but, more than anything else, we condemn violence
against women and girls. Our women are the pillars of
our society and of our families, and our families are the
cornerstone of our society. Allowing violence against
women destroys the very fabric of our society and all
the dreams for our children's peaceful and prosperous
future.

We are very proud to be among the sponsors of
today's Security Council draft resolution on this very
important matter.
