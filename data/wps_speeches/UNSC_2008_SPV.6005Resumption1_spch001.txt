The President (spoke in Chinese): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received letters from
the representatives of Denmark and Tonga, in which
they request to be invited to participate in the
consideration of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the consideration of the item, without
the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, the
representatives of the aforementioned countries
took the seats reserved for them at the side of the
Council Chamber.

The President (spoke in Chinese): I should like
to inform the Council that I have received a letter dated
29 October 2008 from the Permanent Representative of
Burkina Faso, in which he requests that Mrs. Lila
Ratsifandrihamanana, Permanent Observer of the
African Union to the United Nations, be invited to
participate in the consideration of the item in
accordance with rule 39 of the Council's provisional
rules of procedure.

If I hear no objection, I shall take it that the
Security Council agrees to extend an invitation under
rule 39 of its provisional rules of procedure to
Mrs. Ratsifandrihamanana.

It is so decided.

I invite Mrs. Ratsifandrihamanana to take the seat
reserved for her at the side of the Council Chamber.

I wish to remind all speakers, as I indicated this
morning, to limit their statements to no more than five
minutes in order to enable the Council to carry out its
work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy
statements are kindly requested to circulate the text in
writing and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking in the Chamber.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Australia.
