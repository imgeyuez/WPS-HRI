The President (spoke in Chinese): In accordance
with the understanding reached among Council

members, I wish to remind all speakers to limit their
statements to no more five minutes in order to enable
the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate their texts in writing and to
deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.
