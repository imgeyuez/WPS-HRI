The President (spoke in Chinese): There are still
a number of speakers remaining on my list for this
meeting. In view of the lateness of the hour, I intend,
with the concurrence of members of the Council, to
suspend the meeting until 3 p.m. I would like to remind
participants that statements should be limited to five
minutes insofar as possible.

The meeting was suspended at 1.05 p.m.
