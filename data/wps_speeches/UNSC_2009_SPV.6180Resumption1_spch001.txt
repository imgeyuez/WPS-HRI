The President: I wish to remind all speakers, as
my colleague Ambassador Sawers did this morning, to
limit their statements to no more than five minutes in
order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate their texts in writing and
deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Finland.
