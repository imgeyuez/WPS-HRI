The President: I would like to say that we have
heard today many valuable and thought-provoking
views and suggestions on this subject of very grave
concern. All of these helpful contributions will inform
the work of the Council as it prepares a formal
response to the Secretary-General's report over the
next few weeks.

There are no further speakers inscribed on my
list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose at 5.35 pm.
