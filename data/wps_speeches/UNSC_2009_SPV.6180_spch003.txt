The President: I thank the Secretary-General for
his statement and for his leadership on this issue.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Security Council members, I wish to remind all
speakers to limit their statements to no more than five
minutes, in order to enable the Council to carry out its
work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy
statements are kindly requested to circulate the text in
writing and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking in the Chamber.

I shall now give the floor to members of the
Security Council.
