Mr. Takasu (Japan): I should like to extend a
warm welcome to you, Madam, and to thank you for
personally presiding over this important meeting of the
Security Council. We are also grateful to the Secretary-
General and the Deputy Secretary-General for their
presence and their leadership.

Japan is pleased with the unanimous adoption of
resolution 1888 (2009), and highly appreciates the
initiative taken by the delegation of the United States.
This resolution manifests the strong commitment of the
Security Council to combating sexual violence, which
is still prevalent in so many conflict areas in the world.
The resolution provides significant added value to last
year's milestone resolution 1820 (2008). It calls on us
to meet urgent needs on the ground and to transform
our commitment in action. In particular, it enhances a
coordinated United Nations response to sexual violence
in armed conflict and strengthens United Nations
support for national authorities in strengthening the
rule of law.

We need first of all to strengthen measures to
protect victims of sexual violence, but we must also end
the impunity enjoyed by violators. At the same time, I
should like to emphasize the importance of supporting
and empowering women and children in vulnerable
situations. We need to support them in realizing their
full potential, even under difficult circumstances,
through the provision of health services, education and
vocational training, and to ensure the recurrence of
conflict and sexual violence is avoided.

In the general debate last week, Prime Minister
Hatoyama stressed the value of the human security
approach, that is to say, not only to protect but to
empower every individual to live in safety and dignity.
I believe that the human security approach could
provide useful guidance on assisting women and
children in armed conflict. From this point of view,
Japan once again welcomes the adoption of resolution
1888 (2009).
