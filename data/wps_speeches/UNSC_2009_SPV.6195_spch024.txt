Mr. Shalgham (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, I wish to thank you, Madam,
and to convey our appreciation for your initiative. I
also greet Ambassador Susan Rice and thank her for
her efforts and wise leadership of the Security Council
during the month of September, as well as for the
initiatives and projects she has launched. I welcome the
Ministers for Foreign Affairs who have joined us this
morning.

The Council's visit to the Democratic Republic of
the Congo and other African countries that have
experienced long periods of conflict, and our meetings
with a number of victims of acts of sexual violence and
torture, were shocking for all of us. At the same time,
we hold out great hope after meeting with young
people from all regions of the world who are providing
the victims with psychological and professional
assistance. We feel that the human conscience is
stronger and greater than those who commit such
crimes. The will to live is stronger than the will to die.

The perpetrators of acts of violence do not simply
kill their victims, but maim and defile the survivors
irreversibly. As a result, it is essential that domestic
legislation be adopted to ensure that those crimes do
not go unpunished and that the perpetrators be brought
to justice, as they incite hatred and violence.
The events that took place in Conakry, Guinea,
yesterday and the stories we have heard from the poor
and vulnerable women who have suffered and been
raped, then tortured and killed, are truly horrific.

Therefore, I would like to thank you, Madam
President, for this initiative, and the Secretary-General
for his initiative in appointing a Special Representative
for women and sexual violence in areas of conflict.
Any criminal anywhere, whether in Afghanistan, in
Iraq, in the Congo or in Palestine, must be brought to
justice.
