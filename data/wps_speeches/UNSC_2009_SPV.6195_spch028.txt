Mr. Rugunda (Uganda): I welcome the fact that
you are presiding over this Council meeting in person,
Madam President. It is a demonstration of your
commitment to the total elimination of sexual violence,
which has been so prevalent, especially in a number of
African countries. Uganda voted in favour of
resolution 1888 (2009) because of our continued
commitment to the welfare of women, and especially
of girls, who tend to be the primary casualties in
conflict situations.

Sexual violence is a global problem. Therefore,
every effort must be made to ensure that the culprits
are held accountable for their despicable actions. Once
again, that is a reminder that sexual violence in
conflict-related situations can be prevented if peace,
stability and the rule of law are restored in the affected
countries.

Uganda welcomes the resolution's recognition of
the needs of national justice systems that have been
weakened by conflicts and the understanding that, if
the international community does not assist those
institutions to rebuild their capacity, it is useless to call
for an end to impunity or for the prosecution of war
criminals or perpetrators of sexual violence.

Let me take this opportunity to thank Ambassador
Rice and the United States Mission for spearheading
the adoption of this resolution.
