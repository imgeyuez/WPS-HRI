The President: There are no further speakers
inscribed on my list. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.

Before I adjourn the meeting, I want to thank
Ambassador Susan Rice, our Permanent
Representative, and the United States Mission and all
who work with her every day on behalf of our country.
I also wish to thank Ms. Esther Brimmer, Assistant
Secretary for International Organizations, and her staff,
as well as Melanne Verveer, our Ambassador for
Global Women's Issues. I also want to extend my best
wishes to Ms. Norma Chan, Chief of the Security
Council Secretariat Branch, who is retiring today after
36 years with the United Nations. We want to give
Norma a proper send-off as she embarks upon a new
chapter in her life. We thank her for her dedicated
service.

Finally, let me thank all members very much, not
only for their votes but also for their extremely helpful
and substantive comments.

The meeting rose at 11.25 a.m.
