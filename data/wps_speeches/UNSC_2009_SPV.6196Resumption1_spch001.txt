The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Colombia, the Federated States of
Micronesia and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,
in which they request to be invited to participate in the
consideration of the item on the Council's agenda. In
conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite those representatives
to participate in the consideration of the item, without
the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, the
representatives of the aforementioned countries
took the seats reservedfor them at the side of the
Council Chamber.

The President: I wish to remind all speakers, as
was indicated at the morning session, to limit their
statements to no more than five minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
Delegations with lengthy statements are kindly
requested to circulate their texts in writing and to
deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber. I thank participants for their understanding
and cooperation.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Brazil.
