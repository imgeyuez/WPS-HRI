The President: I should like to inform the
Council that I have received a letter from the
representative of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, in which he requests to be invited to participate
in the consideration of the item on the Council's
agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the consideration of the
item, without the right to vote, in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

At the invitation of the President, Mr. Ileka

understanding reached in the Council's prior
consultations, I shall take it that the Security Council

provisional rules of procedure to Mr. Atul Khare,
Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping
Operations.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

I invite Mr. Khare to take a seat at the Council
table.

In accordance with the understanding reached in
the Council's prior consultations, I shall take it that the
