The President: I thank Ms. Awori for her
briefing.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among Council members, I wish to remind all speakers
to limit their statements to no more than five minutes,
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing and to
deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber.

I shall now give the floor to the representatives of
Council members. I invite His Excellency Mr. Michael
Spindelegger, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Austria,
to take the floor.
