Ms. Wallstriim: First of all, I would like to thank
the President for her determined leadership, and that of
the United States of America, on the issue of conflict-
related sexual violence. I also wish to thank all the
Permanent Representatives and delegations for their
supportive, constructive and, I would say, inspiring
interventions.

With the adoption of resolution 1960 (2010) we
have now been given the tools to fight sexual violence
in conflict and to hold the perpetrators accountable
through international scrutiny and pressure; now we
must use them. A resolution is only as good as its
implementation. And implementation, as we all know,
requires sustained resolve as well as resources.

My team and I will consistently remind the world
of the new consensus that we have forged here in the
Security Council. We will deploy the Team of Experts
on the Rule of Law to help Governments to break the
cycle of impunity. We will use the platform of the
United Nations Action against Sexual Violence in
Conflict to ensure a coordinated and coherent response
from the United Nations system, including more
effective prevention, a rapid protection response to
early warning indicators and spikes in sexual violence
and comprehensive support to survivors.

We will continue to amplify in the Chamber the
voices of survivors from war-torn corners of the globe.
We will not rest. We might even be difficult at times.
But, with the Council's help and continued support, we
can and we will stop this scourge. For the first time, we
will name and shame the perpetrators and track their
actions in order to prevent and punish sexual violence
as an act of war.

Ten years since the Council first considered the
issue of women and peace and security, women now
are watching and waiting all over the world.
