Mr. Tolkach (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): With regard to the statement made by the
representative of Georgia, I would like to recall that, as
a result of Georgia's armed aggression in 2008, two
independent States were formed - South Ossetia and
Abkhazia - and that there are no occupying forces on
the territory of those States, as such.
