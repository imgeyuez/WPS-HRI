The President: I would like to inform the
Council that I have received letters from the
representatives of Afghanistan, Fiji and Mexico. In
accordance with rule 37 of the Council's provisional
rules of procedure, I invite those representatives to
participate in the meeting.

I wish to inform the Council that I have received
a letter dated 28 October 2011 from the representative
of Germany, in which he requests that the NATO
Civilian Liaison Officer to the United Nations,
Ms. Eirini Lemos-Maniati, be invited to participate in
the consideration of the item in accordance with rule
39 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.

There being no objection, it is so decided.

The President: I wish to remind all speakers to
limit their statements to no more than four minutes in
order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously.

I now give the floor to the representative of
Ukraine.
