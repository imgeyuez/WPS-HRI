Mr. Mottaghi Nejad (Islamic Republic of Iran): I
wish to thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the
opportunity to take the floor at this late hour.
It was not the intention of my delegation to
deliver a statement on this agenda item. But since the
representative of the Israeli regime, in his statement
this afternoon, once again digressed from the main
discussion in the Council and levelled some allegations
about my country, I ask your indulgence, Mr. President,
so that I might say a few words in that regard.

The representative of the Israeli regime referred
to the case of a woman in Iran. While my delegation
strongly refutes the allegations concerning that young
lady, I would like to mention that it would have been
better for the Israeli representative to talk about the
thousands and thousands of Palestinian women and
girls who have fallen victim to the atrocities committed
by his regime in Gaza and other occupied lands of
Palestine.

I am sure that the members of the Council are
aware of the case of a Palestinian woman who
delivered a baby while being kept waiting for hours at
a checkpoint by the occupying forces. I can cite many,
many other cases of violations of human rights
committed by that regime.

However, my delegation is of the belief that, in
addressing the agenda item under consideration here,
we should stick to the main issues at hand. The Council
is not the proper platform for the representative of a
regime whose occupying forces have violated the basic
human rights of millions of people, including women
and girls, to preach to us about human rights.

I know that the hour is late, but I deemed it
necessary to reply to the childish allegation that was
made.
