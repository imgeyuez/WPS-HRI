Mrs. Furman (Israel): The accusation about
Israel that the representative of Iran made today
insulted the intelligence of everyone in the Chamber.
That regime has zero credibility.

Iran represses its own people, as it helps other
tyrannies to slaughter theirs. As we have seen recently
in Georgia, India and Thailand, Iran is the world's
central banker, chief trainer and primary sponsor of
terror. The Security Council clearly denounced those
attacks today in its press statement (see SC/10556).

Iran provides sophisticated weapons to Hamas,
Hezbollah and other terrorist groups in the region and
around the world. In Iran, the Ayatollah regime
represses its own people, as it helps other tyrannies to
butcher theirs. In his last briefing before the General
Assembly, United Nations Special Rapporteur Shaheed
offered a chilling picture of how daily life in Iran
looks. His report highlighted:

a pattern of systemic violations of ..
fundamental human rights includ[ing]
multifarious deficits in relation to the
administration of justice practices that amount
to torture the imposition of the death penalty
in the absence of proper judicial safeguards
the persecution of religious and ethnic minorities,
and the erosion of civil and political rights".
(A/66/3 74, para. 18)

I could go on but, due to the late hour, I will
leave it at that.
