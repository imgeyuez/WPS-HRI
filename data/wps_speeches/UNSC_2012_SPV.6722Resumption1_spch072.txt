Mr. Musayev (Azerbaijan): Again, I apologize
for asking for the floor. It is curious, to say the least,
that the representative of Armenia, the country that
bears the primary responsibility for unleashing the war
against Azerbaijan and committing other serious
international crimes during the conflict, takes the floor
in the Security Council and tries to lecture the victim
of aggression.

The Government of Armenia, which has purged
both the territory of its own country and the occupied
areas of Azerbaijan of all non-Armenians, and thus
succeeded in creating mono-ethnic cultures there,
should be, in our view, the last one to speak on such
notions as peace, human rights and the self-
determination of peoples.

As far as the reference to the Nagorny Karabakh
region of Azerbaijan is concerned, I should recall that
the Security Council has recognized that Nagorny
Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan and reaffirmed respect
for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and
inviolability of the international borders of Azerbaijan.

We consider the stance of Armenia as an open
challenge to the conflict settlement process and a
serious threat to international and regional peace and
security.

The earlier the officials of that country

understand the lack of any perspective in their

unconstructive and dangerous political agenda, the

sooner our people will be able to benefit from peace,
stability and cooperation.
