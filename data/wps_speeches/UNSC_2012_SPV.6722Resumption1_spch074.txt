Mr. Nazarian (Armenia): I apologize for keeping
the Council at work at this late hour, but I have asked
for the floor again to exercise my right to make a
further statement after hearing the brazen attempt by
the representative of Azerbaijan to distract the
Council's attention from the reality on the ground by
shifting the responsibility for its own militaristic
actions and ceasefire violations on others, whom it
spares no effort in portraying as aggressors.

It is deeply disappointing that, even after its
election to membership of this responsible organ of the
United Nations, Azerbaijan continues its irresponsible
practice of putting the blame on others in order to hide
its own crimes and provocations. Unfortunately, this
has become a regular exercise for Azerbaijan. It is
unethical to deliver such defamatory statements in the
Council, which serve no other purpose than to shatter
the hope for peaceful coexistence between peoples.

Rather than deliver such an appalling statement
as a propaganda tool, Azerbaijan should focus, as I said
earlier, on cooperating with the co-Chairs and missions
of the Minsk Group of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, and do its part in
conducting the investigation pursuant to the statement
issued by the Armenian, Russian and Azerbaijani
Presidents at their Sochi meeting in March 2011.

The Azerbaijani side should realize that such
cheap shots and statements are not only unconvincing,
but are shameful and will not be tolerated by this body.
