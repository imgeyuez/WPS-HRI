Ms. Wallstriim: I wish simply to make two short
remarks. First, I thank the presidency for steering this
meeting, and all members of the Security Council for
what I think has been a very serious, constructive and
principled debate. If any issue should unite us, it is this
one.

I have also heard one word used by every speaker
throughout this discussion. It is the word "prevention".
We cannot prevent armed conflict when it is already
ongoing, or widespread or systematic sexual violence
that has already begun. If we are to deliver on the
promise of prevention, we cannot fail to monitor,
undermine or delay our response. The best impact that
the Council can have is to give united political support
to our efforts to prevent conflict-related sexual
violence. I am not here to expand my mandate. I am
here to do a good, effective job that brings added value
to the Council's deliberations.

I thank the Council for the presidential statement
that it has just adopted. I can promise that I will
continue to cooperate with all members, and I hope for
their continued support. Finally, I want to say that we
have taken a principled approach in reporting
systematic patterns, as distinct from isolated incidents
of individual criminality. We have been disciplined in
our focus on sexual violence that is linked to the
maintenance and restoration of international peace and
security. We will continue to do so.
