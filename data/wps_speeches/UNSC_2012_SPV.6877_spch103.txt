The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of speakers. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on the agenda.

As this is most certainly the last open meeting
of the Council that I will be presiding as part of the
second presidency of our current tenure on the Security
Council, I would like to take this opportunity to express
the sincere appreciation of the delegation of India to the
members of the Council, especially my colleagues the
permanent representatives, the political coordinators of
each delegation and their respective staff, and to the
Secretariat for all the support that they have given to us.

To say that this has been a busy month would
be an understatement. We tried our best to achieve
convergence and consensus on several important
issues on the agenda of the Council. We could not
have done this alone or without the hard work, support
and positive contributions of every delegation and
the representatives of the Secretariat, as well as the
interpreters, translators, meeting services and sound
engineers. I want to thank each and every one of them
individually and collectively. As we end our presidency,
I know I speak on behalf of all Council members in
wishing the delegation of Morocco the very best ofluck
in the month of December.

The meeting rose at 4.45 p.m.
