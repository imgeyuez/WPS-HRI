Ms. Alsaleh (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): I would like to respond to some claims just
made by the representatives of Qatar and Turkey
concerning my country.

What we have heard today from some
delegations - and this is extremely important, as we
have already said - is that the ending sexual violence,
combating it in conflict situations and eliminating the
consequences of armed conflict can be achieved by
removing the root causes of those scourges, stopping
the financing for terrorism, ending interference in the
internal affairs of States and combating policies that
instigate sexual violence against women.

We would like to reaffirm that the negative roles
that Qatar and Turkey have played, which are no secret
to anyone in this international Organization, have
contributed to aggravating the situation in Syria, rather
than to finding a settlement thereto. Some sheikhs
in Qatar provide all kinds of support to terrorists, in
particular those affiliated with Al-Qaida, by providing
money, weapons and media support.

I must not neglect to mention the actions by the
Turkish authorities in smuggling mercenaries and
weapons through our common borders and the rape by
soldiers of Syrian refugee women in camps established
on Turkish territory. I would like to recall that, on more
than one occasion, many officials, including officials
from the Turkish Parliament, were prevented from
visiting certain camps on Turkish territory.

In conclusion, we would like to reaffirm that the
ambiguous role played by the sheikhs of Qatar will
not go unnoticed by the Syrian people. The Syrian
people will in the future prosecute all those who have
committed crimes against them. We have specialized
national committees tasked with investigating all those
crimes, which will be pursued in due course.
