The President: I wish to remind all speakers to
limit their statements to no more than four minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing and
to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber. The presidency will cut off those delegations
that speak for significantly more than four minutes.

I also wish to inform all concerned that we will be
carrying on this open debate right through the lunch
hour, as we have a very large number of speakers.

I now give the floor to the representative of Brazil.
