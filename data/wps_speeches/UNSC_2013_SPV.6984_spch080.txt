The President: Before I give the floor to the next
speaker, I would like to remind all speakers to follow
the example of Italy and limit their statements to no
more than four minutes in order to enable the Council
to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with
lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate the
text in writing and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking in the Chamber. The presidency will cut off
those delegations that speak for significantly more than
four minutes.

I now give the floor to the representative of Bosnia
and Herzegovina.
