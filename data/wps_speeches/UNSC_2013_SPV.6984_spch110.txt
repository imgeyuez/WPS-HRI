The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of speakers.

Before I draw the meeting to a close, I note that
Special Representative of the Secretary-General
Bangura has been with us throughout almost the entire
debate and is here with us at the end. I thank her again
for her briefing and all her work in this crucual area.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of the consideration of the item on the
agenda.

The meeting rose at 4.50 pm.
