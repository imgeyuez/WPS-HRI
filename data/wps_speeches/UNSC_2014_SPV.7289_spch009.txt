The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank
Ms. Allami for her testimonial and statement.

Members of the Council have before them the text
of a draft presidential statement on the topic of today's
meeting. I thank the Council members for their valuable
contributions to the statement.

In accordance with the understanding reached
among the members of the Council, I shall take it
that the members of the Security Council agree to the
statement, which will be issued as a document of the
Security Council under the symbol S/PRST/2014/2l.

It is so decided.

I shall now give the floor to the members of the
Security Council.
