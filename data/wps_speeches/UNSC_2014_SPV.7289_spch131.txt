Mr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): We have been compelled to take the floor
again in connection with the statement made by the
representative of Ukraine. Once again, colleagues are
attempting to turn things around in order to put the
blame on Russia for the consequences resulting from
the unwillingness or incapacity of the Kyiv authorities
to resolve their problems in a civilized manner through
national dialogue.

It is not some kind of mythical Russian aggression
that has led to the hundreds of victims among the
civilian population, including women, and a large
number of refugees and internally displaced persons,
but rather a large-scale punitive operation that has
been launched by the authorities in the eastern part of
the country and is characterized by an arbitrary and
excessive use of force.

In its statements, the Ukrainian delegation likes to
quote various passages from the reports of the United
Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine.
In that connection, it may be recalled that the latest
report contained references to enforced disappearances,
murders, vandalism, arbitrary detentions and atrocities
carried out by both the Kyiv security forces and the
battalions under their command - the Aydar, Azov,
Dnipro-l, Kyiv-1 and Kyiv-2 battalions - and the
terrible number of victims among civilians resulting
from the indiscriminate artillery shelling of densely
populated civilian areas and the use of heavy artillery
and banned munitions. I could continue with that list.

With regard to Nadiya Savchenko, who was
mentioned by the Ukrainian colleague, in that
connection I would like to recall another topic that
has often been discussed by the Council, namely,
the protection of journalists. In fact, Savchenko is
being accused of abetting the killing of two Russian
journalists. As all are aware, in the various meetings,
including those of the Security Council, it has been
noted that a lack of accountability for such crimes is
unacceptable.
