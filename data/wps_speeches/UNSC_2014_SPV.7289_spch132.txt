The President (spoke in Spanish): There are no
more names inscribed on the list of speakers.
I would like to thank everyone present for having
participated in this debate on women and peace and
security. I would like to mention that this issue does not
always attract great numbers. However, it is excellent
that the debate this year has seen the greatest number of
participants among Member States. Indeed, 72 speakers
have come together in what has proved a respectful and

diverse debate in promoting the protection ofthe rights
of women.

The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.

The meeting rose at 6.45 pm.
