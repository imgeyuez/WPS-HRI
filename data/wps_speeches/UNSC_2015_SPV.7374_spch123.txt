Mr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I would like very briefly to respond to the
statement made by the representative of Ukraine.

Such attempts yet again to place all of the blame
for what takes place in that country onto the Russian
Federation come as a surprise to no one. Even the
reports regarding the shelling by the Ukrainian army
of residential areas, in violation of international
humanitarian law - reports coming from a variety
of sources, which cannot in any way be regarded as
Russian propaganda - provoke no response from Kyiv
other than yet further accusations against the Russian
Federation. Quite clearly, our Lithuanian colleagues
also take a selective attitude to such sources as well.

The reality is that on 13 April 2014, our delegation
initiated the convening of an emergency meeting of the
Security Council (see S/PV.7154) in order to attempt
to prevent the Ukrainian authorities from using armed
force in south-eastern Ukraine. We were unable to do
so. The so-called anti-terrorist operation was launched,
claiming civilian victims in its very first week. We
have called again and again for an end to the violence
and for the initiation of a full-fledged national dialogue
that would avert further civilian casualties in Ukraine.
Such an appeal was made to the authorities in Kyiv
as recently as today by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
Unfortunately, those calls have gone unheeded to date.

In conclusion, I recall that the topic of today's
meeting is the protection of civilians. Nadiya Savchenko,
a Ukrainian military officer, is not a civilian. However,
the Russian journalists were definitely civilians, and
she is accused of helping to kill them.
