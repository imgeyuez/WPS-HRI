Mr. Tsymbaliuk (Ukraine): I apologise for taking
the floor again. I will try to be very brief.

First of all, I should like my Russian colleague to
read very closely the latest reports of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe on what is going
on in Ukraine. I also wish to reiterate once again that
Nadiya Savchenko was a member of the Parliamentary
Assembly of the Council of Europe, so her case is
totally applicable to the theme we are discussing today.

At the same time, I would like once again to ask the
Russian representative, if possible, to avoid misleading
the Security Council on the current situation in
Ukraine and to stop using this forum as a tool of simple
propaganda.
