The President (spoke in Spanish): The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.

Before adjourning the meeting, I would like to
express the sincere appreciation of the delegation of
Chile to the members of the Council, especially my
colleagues the Permanent Representatives and their
respective staffs, and to the secretariat of the Council for
all the support they have given to us. Indeed, it has been
a busy month, and one in which we rallied to consensus
on several important issues within our purview. We
could not have done it alone and without the hard work,
support and positive contributions of every delegation
and the representatives of the Secretariat, as well as all
relevant conference service officers.

As we end our presidency, I know I speak on behalf
of the Council in wishing the delegation of China good
luck in the month of February.

The meeting rose at 6.05 pm.
