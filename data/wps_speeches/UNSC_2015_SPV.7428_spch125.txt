Mr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): IfI may, I would like to comment on the
statement made by the representative of Ukraine. The
theme of today's meeting was conflict-related sexual
violence. I do not recall hearing those words in his
statement, which we believe is a clear example of
abusing the forum of the Security Council.

That once again shows that those colleagues are not
so interested in the theme of the meeting, but rather they
wanted a pretext to set out a whole string of accusations
against Russia. The accusations do not change, and we
have repeatedly commented and responded, including
on the issue of Ms. Savchenko, which again has nothing
to do with today's theme of sexual violence in conflict.

If we are going to speak of the real problems of
women living in the south-east of Ukraine, then today
their problems are above all due to the blockade of
the region by the Kyiv authorities. In Donetsk and
Luhansk there is therefore a lack of food and medicine.
Social benefits are not being paid out and the most
urgent services are not being provided. However, our
colleagues preferred not to mention that.
