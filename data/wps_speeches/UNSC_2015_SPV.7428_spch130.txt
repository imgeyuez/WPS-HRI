The President (spoke in Arabic): I shall now make
a further statement in my national capacity as the
representative of Jordan.

I would like to refer to certain allegations by the
representative of Syria with respect to Syrian refugee
camps in neighbouring States such as Jordan. Since the
beginning of the crisis, Jordan has stood by its brothers
in their humanitarian tragedy, receiving huge numbers
of them and facilitating the delivery of humanitarian
assistance in line with the relevant Security Council
resolutions. The reference to the refugee camps by
the representative of Syria insults United Nations
efforts. Those camps were established in Jordan, in
collaboration with the Office ofthe United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian
United Nations agencies. Jordan is a State of law and
institutions. We respect the human rights of all people,
including women. We are committed to providing
assistance to Syrian refugees who were forced to flee
their country, particularly women and children, in line
with international criteria. The comments made and the
Secretary-General's report (S/2015/203) demonstrate
the gross violations against women in Syria.

1 now resume my functions as President of the
Council.

The meeting rose at 6.10pm.
