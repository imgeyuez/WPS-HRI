The President (spoke in Spanish): I wish to remind
all speakers to kindly limit their statements to no
more than four minutes in order to enable the Council
to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with
lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate
the texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version
when speaking in the Chamber in order for us to work
more efficiently. I would like to appeal to speakers to
deliver their statements at a normal speed so that the
interpreters can do their work properly.

I now give the floor to the representative ofAustria.
