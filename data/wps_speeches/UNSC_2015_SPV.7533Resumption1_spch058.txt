Mr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I would like to respond to the statement made
by the representative of Georgia, while assuring the
Council that in View of the lateness of the hour I will
be brief.

We of course reject the accusations made against
us. We have repeatedly stated our position on the issue
and I will not do so again here. As I understood it, the
representative of Georgia expressed concerns about
the situation of women in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
In that regard, we would like to propose inviting to
one of our meetings on the topic under discussion
representatives of women's non-governmental
organizations from those republics, who could provide
us with full and first-hand information on the true
situation in that area.
