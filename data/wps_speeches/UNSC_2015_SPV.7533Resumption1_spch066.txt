Mr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): This statement will be even briefer than my
last. From the statement given by our colleague from
Georgia, I understand that he clearly is worried by the
presence of women from Abkhazia and South Ossetia
and their participation in any discussion. I would urge
him in future not to transcend the bounds of what is
proper. The assessments we have heard here are simply
not acceptable within the framework of a professional
discussion in the Security Council.
