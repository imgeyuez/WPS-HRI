The President (spoke in Spanish): I wish to remind
all speakers to limit their statements to no more than
four minutes in order to enable the Council to carry
out its work expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy
statements are kindly requested to circulate their texts
in writing and to deliver a condensed version when
speaking in the Chamber. I would also like to appeal to
speakers to deliver their statements at a normal speed
so that interpretation may be provided properly.

I wish to inform all concerned that we will be
carrying on this open debate right through the lunch
hour, as we have a very large number of speakers.
I now give the floor to Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of International Relations and Cooperation of
Namibia. I am especially pleased to do so since Namibia
was the country that presided over the Security Council
when resolution 1325 (2000) was adopted.
