The President (spoke in Spanish): I thank the
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine for speaking in
Spanish at the beginning of his statement. Spanish is a
language shared by many Members of the Organization,
and yesterday we celebrated Spanish Day here at the
United Nations.

I now give the floor to the Minister for Social
Equality of Israel.
