Mr. Aboulatta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Egypt
is proposing an amendment to paragraph 2 of the
draft resolution (8/2016/235) that has been submitted
to the Security Council. This is the paragraph that
details the conditions under which a contingent would
be repatriated in the case of an allegation of sexual
exploitation and abuse. The amendment consists of a
slight modification to the language in the paragraph,
to be put to a separate vote. The original language
proposed by the United States delegation would allow
taking arbitrary and unobjective decisions amounting to
collective punishment against hundreds ofpeacekeeping
personnel. That would undoubtedly have severe and
negative impacts on the morale of personnel and tarnish
the reputation of troop-contributing countries.

Our proposed amendment is aimed at addressing
that loophole in the draft resolution by specifying the
conditions that would have to be met in order to take
action with regard to an entire contingent. Those three
conditions are: a failure by the troop-contributing
country to investigate allegations of sexual exploitation
and abuse; a failure by the troop-contributing country
to punish those guilty of sexual exploitation and abuse;
and a failure by the troop-contributing country to
inform the Secretary-General of the measures taken
against those who commit acts of sexual exploitation
and abuse.
