Mr. Seek (Senegal) (spoke in French): I thank the
United States delegation for having taken the initiative
of submitting to the Security Council the text of
resolution 2272 (2016), which we have just adopted,
concerning cases of sexual exploitation and abuse
committed by United Nations peacekeeping personnel
and external forces authorized by the Council.

As a troop- and police-contributing country and
in accordance with its international commitments
to peacekeeping and respect for international
humanitarian law and international human rights law,
Senegal naturally voted in favour of the resolution.
The delegation of Senegal participated actively in the
negotiations in a constructive spirit and accordingly
proposed amendments aimed at making the text clearer
with a View to ensuring that innocent parties do not
fall victim to collective punishment for crimes that are
a matter of individual responsibility. The delegation
of Senegal would have therefore liked the resolution
to take into account the sometimes difficult situations
faced by States concerned with regard to carrying out
investigations and enquiries.

My delegation regrets that several of the concerns
we voiced with a view to making the text more balanced
were not reflected in the resolution. However, Senegal's
commitment to the zero-zolerance policy called for by
the Secretary-General remains absolute, given that the
fight against impunity must remain a collective and
universal exigency.
