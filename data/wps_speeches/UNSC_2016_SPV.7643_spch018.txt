Mr. Bermudez (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish):
Uruguay wishes to express its satisfaction for the
adoption earlier in this meeting of resolution 2272
(2016). At the outset, we want to thank the United States
for its timely initiative. Uruguay is very pleased to join
the rest of the Council in their agreement that dealing
with this problem can no longer be postponed.

With regard to the content of the resolution, which
is in line with the concept of zero tolerance, in our dual
capacity as a member of the Security Council and a
troop-contributing country, we believe that, although
the text could be further improved, given the sensitivity
ofthe issue, it nonetheless has important provisions for
combating such reprehensible acts, which, as was said
in yesterday's meeting on the subject (see S/PV.7642),
affect not only the image and credibility of United
Nations peacekeeping operations but, above all, have
an impact on the dignity of the victims who suffer,
often irreversibly, from their consequences. For all of
those reasons, therefore, Uruguay voted in favour of
the resolution.

Lastly, we would like to reiterate that all staffwho the Security Council, must be held accountable for
are part of United Nations peacekeeping operations, their actions.

whether military, police or civilian components, just

like all personnel in other operations authorized by The meeting rose at 4.10pm.
