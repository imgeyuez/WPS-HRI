Mr. Begec (Turkey): Our delegation has asked
for the floor to reply to the statement made by the
representative of Syria. In order to do so, I shall read
out a section from the report of the Secretary-General
on conflict-related sexual violence. The paragraph
concerns the Syrian Arab Republic.

"The Independent International Commission of
Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic reported
in September that women, men and children
continued to be subjected to sexual violence by
Government personnel at checkpoints and in
detention (see A/HRC/30/48). The United Nations
received accounts of the systematic sexual torture
of men in detention centres, including rape with
wooden sticks, and electric shocks to, and burning
of, genitals. Such sexual torture was aimed at
obtaining confessions of the men's involvement in
alleged anti-Government activities. In some cases,
female relatives were also arrested and forced to
witness the torture." (S/2016/36], para. 68)

I read out this passage because I want to alert
everyone to what the Syrian regime truly represents.
