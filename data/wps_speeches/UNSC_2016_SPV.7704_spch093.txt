Mr. Qassem Agha (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in Arabic): All statements contained in the report on
violations of human rights, including those of women
and children, in Turkish refugee camps are included
in documents issued by the Turkish media. We did

not draft those news items. This information has been
propagated through social media and at the highest
level ofthe Turkish media.

We underline this request to Ms. Bangura. She
knows very well what happens in refugee camps in
Turkey and other neighbouring countries. It is written
on the wall. [would ask her to cite those instances, too.

The meeting rose at 4.25 pm.
