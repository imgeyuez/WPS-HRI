The President (spoke in Spanish): I wish to
remind speakers that they should limit their statements
to no more than four minutes in order to enable the
Council to carry out its work expeditiously. The
presidency will use the flashing lights on the collars
of their microphones to prompt speakers to bring their
remarks to a close. Delegations with lengthy statements
are kindly requested to circulate the texts thereof in
writing or to upload them to PaperSmart and deliver a
condensed version when speaking in the Chamber.

I now give the floor to the representative of Mexico.
