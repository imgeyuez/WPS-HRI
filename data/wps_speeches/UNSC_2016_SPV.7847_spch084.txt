The President (spoke in Spanish): Before giving
the floor to the next speaker, I would like to inform
those present that, at the present time in our debate,
we still have to hear more than 20 people on the list
of speakers. I would like to remind speakers to limit
their statements to four minutes. I thank them for
their cooperation.

I now give the floor to the representative
of Paraguay.
