The President: I wish to point out to all Member
States that we are really pleased to see how many
people want to participate in this important debate. But
in order to be fair to the 20 speakers that are still on
the list, I will use my gavel if speakers go beyond four
minutes. I would ask that those assisting Permanent
Representatives tap her or him on the shoulder if she or
he risks going over the time limit. Delegations should
feel free to circulate full remarks to all members of the
Security Council afterwards.

I now give the floor to the representative of the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
