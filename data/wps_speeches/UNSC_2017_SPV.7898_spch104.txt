The President: I would again remind speakers that
there is a four-minute time limit for their statements. If
they turn their microphone in the correct way, they will
see the flashing light. The set-up is not very fair for the
speakers, as the microphones are not well designed to
help them see the time. But if the microphone is turned
in the right way, then the speaker will be able to see the
flashing light.

I now give the floor to the representative of Slovakia.
