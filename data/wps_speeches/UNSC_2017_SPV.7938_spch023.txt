The President (spoke in Spanish): I should like to
remind all speakers to limit their statements to no more
than four minutes in order for the Council to be able
to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with
lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate
their texts in writing and deliver a condensed version
when speaking in the Chamber.

I now give the floor to the representative of Spain.
