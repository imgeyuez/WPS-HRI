The President (spoke in Spanish): We are pleased
to see the interest generated by this open debate.
However, I remind participants that 21 speakers remain
on the list. I call for speakers' cooperation in limiting
their statements to no more than four minutes.

I now give the floor to the representative of the
Czech Republic.
