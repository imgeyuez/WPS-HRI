Mr. Vitrenko (Ukraine): To be fully consistent
with the agenda for today's meeting, let me once again
quote from the statement made by Ukraine's Vice-Prime
Minister, which was probably lost in translation for
some delegations.

Women make up 58 per cent, or almost 1 million, of
the 1.7 million internally displaced persons in Ukraine.
This is all an undisputed direct consequence of the
Russian aggression against Ukraine, aggression that has
been recognized worldwide, including by the General
Assembly, which unequivocally qualified the Russian
Federation as an occupying Power in my country.

As such, and ifRussia is so concerned about the fate
of women in the territories it occupies in my country, it
should stop sending troops, weapons and ammunition
to eastern Ukraine. Until that happens, Russia is not in
a position to lecture others on a situation it intentionally
created and continues to stir up.

As for the so-called humanitarian assistance
provided by Russia to Ukraine, I just wonder who is to
thank for that - probably its proxies in Donbas, since,
for example, the last so-called humanitarian convoy
contained at least two modern Russian tanks and a full
load of ammunition for them. Nice example indeed.

Finally, there are hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners
in Russian captivity. We are doing everything in our
power to get them out of Russian prisons, irrespective
of their gender or political views. Once free from
captivity, some of them carry out, in a completely free
manner, an active political life and occupy high-profile
political posts, including in the Parliament.
