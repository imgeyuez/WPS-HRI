The President (spoke in French): I wish to
remind speakers that they are requested to limit their
statements to no more than four minutes in order to
enable the Council to carry out its work expeditiously.
This is the customary statement. Dedications with
lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate
the text in writing and to deliver a condensed version
when speaking in the Chamber. I wish to inform all
concerned that we will be carrying on this open debate
right through the lunch hour, as have a large number
of speakers.

I now give the floor to the Minister for Foreign
Affairs of Colombia.
