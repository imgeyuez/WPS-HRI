Ms. Diop: I would like to thank the members of the
Security Council for giving us this opportunity to brief
them. My special thanks go to you, Madam President,
and to the Deputy Secretary-General for your generosity
in staying so long in the region and listening to African
women. We are very happy that you could come back
and report to the Security Council. I am very glad to
see the entire Security Council fully support the agenda
and our mission, and we hope that we will implement
whatever is decided here.

I need to echo again the concern of the women of
South Sudan. South Sudan needs to get back to where it
was before when there was peace and security. Women
are asking that we restore their dignity. They want to go
back to the peace process. They want to be part of the
governance mechanism to be put in place. They want
to be part of the future elections and the process of
fighting against impunity. We have heard them.

My Office has supported many countries in Africa.
So far, we have 22 national action plans. I want to do
more, with the support of everybody, to make sure
that by 2020 almost half of the countries of Africa
have a national action plan. But national action plans
are not just the end of it. That is why my Office has
also developed a continental results-based framework
to measure progress in implementation. We need to
go beyond resolutions and frameworks to measuring
progress with indicators and targets. The African
Union Chairperson will, through my Office, deliver
an annual report that can be shared with the Security
Council. I hope that, with this, we can measure the
implementation of the women, peace and security
agenda and the development of the continent of Africa.
