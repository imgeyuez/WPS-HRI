The President: There are no more names inscribed
on the list of of speakers.

I would mention one more thing that we forgot to
to tell the Security Council. The cooperation among
the European Union, the African Union and the United
Nations in a project like the Spotlight project in the
Niger to prevent sexual violence against girls and
women is, I think, a good example of how we have to
continue to take this forward.

The meeting rose at 12.35 pm.
