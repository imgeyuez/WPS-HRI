The President (spoke in Spanish): I would like
to remind all speakers to limit their statements to no
more than four minutes in order to enable the Council
to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations with
lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate
their text in writing and to deliver a condensed
version when speaking in the Chamber. I also want to
inform everyone that we will be continuing this open
debate through the lunch hour, as we have a long list
of speakers.

I now give the floor to the representative of Japan.
