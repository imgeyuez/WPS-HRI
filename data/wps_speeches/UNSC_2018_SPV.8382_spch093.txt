Mr. Arriola Ramirez (Paraguay) (spoke in Spanish): The delegation of the Republic of Paraguay
is grateful for the briefings delivered on the topic under
discussion and commends the Bolivian presidency of
the Security Council for promoting the relevance of
the agenda on women and peace and security. I will
present the Paraguayan delegation's contribution to the
debate from three perspectives, that is, the principles
that inspire our country, the actions that we carry out
at the national level for the political and economic
empowerment of women, and our vision regarding the
role of the United Nations and the Security Council
with regard to women and peace and security.

First of all, on the seventieth anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we recall that
the shared ideal of peoples and nations is full respect
for those rights and freedoms and their universal and
effective recognition and implementation, without
distinction. In that regard, our 1992 Constitution
guarantees equality between men and women with
respect to civil, political, social, economic and cultural
rights, and the Government of Paraguay works to promote
women as a factor for change in the country, generating
conditions of equity, equality and empowerment. The
responsibility to protect the population, especially
women and girls and the most vulnerable population
groups, rests principally with States. Initiatives for
the political and economic empowerment of women in
situations of conflict must be framed within the efforts
to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals of the
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

Regarding our actions that we consider relevant
to this debate, in Paraguay the Ministry of Women
promotes and implements public policies with a gender
perspective and promotes the full exercise of women's
human rights, mainly through the 2018-2023 national
plan for equal opportunities for women and men.
Ciudad Mujer, an exclusive centre for women and their
children, offers an array of 80 interconnected and
coordinated services providing comprehensive care,
including economic empowerment, education on equity
and sexual and reproductive health, child care and the
prevention and awareness of violence against women.
More recently, Ciudad Mujer deployed mobile units to
reach women and their children in the most remote and
inaccessible areas of our territory.

Paraguay encourages women's access to formal
credit through conditioned money-transfer programmes,
wherethe transfers are grantedbymicrocreditcommittees
that are administered by women and prioritize women
heads of household, as well as through the Agricultural
Credit for Empowerment facility - Credito Agricola
de Habilitacion - the portfolio of which has seen
an increase in the proportion of women clients from
10 to 38 per cent since 2013. Through its law on the
comprehensive protection of women against all types
of violence, Paraguay incorporated the criminalization
of femicide into its criminal legislation, and through
the law on public policies for rural women and the
inter-institutional commission for the implementation
of the law, which is composed of 12 institutions, we
encourage the participation of rural women in spaces
for policymaking and access to the public services
offered by the State.

Finally, with regard to the role of the United Nations
and the Security Council in the agenda on women and
peace and security, the delegation of Paraguay favours,
first, the participation of women in decision-making
in peace processes and in training for their effective
participation in those processes; secondly, the Security
Council's clear inclusion of the protection of women
in armed conflicts in the mandates of peacekeeping
operations; thirdly, advice from gender experts in the
planning of political and peacekeeping missions and
in sanctions committees; and, fourthly, specialized
training for contingents involved in peacekeeping
missions, both prior to and after their deployment,
on civilian-military coordination, violence and
gender inequality.
