Ms.Merekaje:MynameisLornaMerekaje.Iaddress
the Security Council today in my capacity as Secretary
General of South Sudan Democratic Engagement
Monitoring and Observation Programmethat is anational
civil society organization in South Sudan focusing on
good governance and democracy, conflict mitigation
and gender mainstreaming in my beloved country. I
also speak as one of two women representatives in the
National Constitutional Amendment Committee out of
15 members of the Committee, which was established
under the revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of
the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan.

On behalf of my organization and the women of
South Sudan and on my own behalf, please accept my
humble gratitude, Madam, for inviting me to address
the Council today. With your permission, allow me to
add my voice in emphasizing the importance of this
discussion on women in peacekeeping operations. As
the world has come to realize the significance of the
meaningful involvement of women in decision-making
in all spheres of life, I would like to mention that my
country is still grappling with that fact, and especially
the fulfilment of the 25 per cent affirmative action
target provided by the Constitution, which has now
been increased to 35 per cent, in accordance with
the revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the
Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, signed in
September 2018.

While we appreciate the efforts that have been made

so far by the United Nations, I would like to argue that
peacekeeping efforts could add more value to the lives
of ordinary citizens in host countries if the number of
women in missions were increased and if they were
engaged in undertaking roles and responsibilities at
both the leadership and the supportive levels within
peacekeeping operations in the host countries.

I would like to reiterate my genuine concerns
regarding the operating environments and facilities
for female peacekeeping personnel while on mission
in host countries, as well as the challenges faced by
troop- and police-contributing countries (TCCs/PCCs)
in ensuring that female personnel meet the deployment
criteria set out for participation in peacekeeping
operations. However, in my view, these challenges can
be addressed if there exists adequate will on the part
of all actors to address them. I am referring to host
countries, TCCs, PCCs and Council members.

We recognize the significance of ground-breaking
decisions of the Council, such as resolution 1325 (2000)
and subsequent resolutions - specifically resolution
2242 (2015), which calls for doubling the number of
women in peacekeeping operations, and especially
in police contingents, by increasing their number
through 2020 - the Secretary-General's Action
for Peacekeeping initiative and the efforts made by
different countries to develop national action plans for
the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).

Experience has shown that increasing the number of
women in peacekeeping operations is likely to encourage
positive and friendly interaction between mission
personnel and the host country and communities, as is
the case with the all-female contingent of Bangladesh
and female peacekeeping officers deployed in Haiti,
as well as the kind of relationship that UN-Women,
country offices and the Gender Section of the United
Nations Mission in South Sudan continue to build with
South Sudanese women.

My appeal to the Council today is that, first, it ensure
that decisions made with respect to the deployment
of peacekeeping operations reflect the commitments
made to date and demand action from the stakeholders
involved, such as the TCCs, PCCs and host countries.

Secondly, it should impose specific standards
and requirements for missions and peacekeeping
operations in upholding and instituting periodic review
mechanisms in order to create and maintain positive
relationships and the engagement of peacekeeping
personnel with the host communities.

Thirdly, it should review and improve standards and
working conditions for female personnel on mission so
as to ensure the full integration of women and peace and
security objectives, including mentorship programmes
designed for retention and career development for
female civilian and uniformed personnel.

Fourthly, it should enhance the mandate of United
Nations country missions to include the meaningful
engagement and participation of local civil society,
women and youth organizations in the design and
implementation of United Nations peace operations,
United Nations-led peace processes, political dialogues
and peacebuilding initiatives in the country. I believe
that it is important to engage the organizations that exist
in the country so that the community has confidence in
any initiative that is implemented.

Finally, in order to sustain and build upon progress
made to date in the advancement of the women and
peace and security agenda, and while we talk about
increasing numbers of women in peacekeeping
operations, I also want to mention that it is important
for us not to lose track of the need to seek justice and
accountability for sexual and gender-based violence
committed by peacekeeping personnel in different
countries around the world.
