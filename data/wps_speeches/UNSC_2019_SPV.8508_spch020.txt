The President: I would like to remind all speakers
to limit their statements to no more than four minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements are
kindly requested to circulate the texts in writing and
to deliver a condensed version when speaking in the
Chamber. I also want to inform everyone that we will
be carrying on this open debate through the lunch hour,
as we have a very large number of speakers to hear this
afternoon on this important topic.

I now give the floor to the Minister for Foreign
Affairs and Trade of Hungary.
