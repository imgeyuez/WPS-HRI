Major General Lund: I thank the President for
this opportunity to take the floor again, and I thank
participants for all the good input so far. It is good to
see that there is a lot of momentum on this topic in the
Security Council, even if, as one who is in the field, I
can say that the numbers are saying something else.

In answer to the question from the representative
of the United Kingdom, I think the first and most
important action is to get the numbers up. Numbers
matter when we are out there. Secondly, every camp and
position must be able to accommodate both genders. I
did it myself, within two years. It was possible - and
that was for all 26 positions, or camps. Thirdly, it has
not been mentioned by many people that men need to
be champions in the promotion of gender equality. We
need more men to talk to men, because, most likely,
they have a better way of communicating with each
other than I do. Those are my three points.
