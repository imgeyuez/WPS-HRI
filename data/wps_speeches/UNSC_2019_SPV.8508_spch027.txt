Ms. Merekaje: I wish to express my appreciation
for everyone's comments. We are making progress. We
are heading somewhere. I would like to say that, first,
there is a need to improve on the facilities so that we are
able to retain those who are already in peacekeeping
missions. Secondly, we need to strengthen mentorship
programmes so that we are able to prepare more young
women to take up roles in peacekeeping operations.
Thirdly, the troop- and police-contributing countries
need to look at their in-country legislation so that they
are able to create environments that encourage young
women to join the service.

The standards for joining the service should be set
out for young women so that they are prepared to meet
the required standards for service. We have seen cases
where young women have encountered an obstacle to
serving in a mission because they do not know how
to drive a manual vehicle. If that requirement were to
be made clear in advance, then young women would
be able to prepare themselves to qualify and join the
service. In that way we will be able to get more women
in the service and they can then qualify to go on
peacekeeping missions.

I would like to excuse myself because I have to
catch up with the curfew outside.
