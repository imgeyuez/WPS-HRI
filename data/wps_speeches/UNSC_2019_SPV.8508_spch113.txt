The President: Taking into consideration that
Germany is also part of the United Nations Interim
Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), I take the statement
made by the representative of Lebanon as having been
directed towards us as well. There should be more
women in UNIFIL.

I now give the floor to the representative of Egypt.
