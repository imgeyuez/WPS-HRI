The President: I would like to take this opportunity
to thank all delegations for their contributions to
this open debate. We have heard from 63 speakers,
including three briefers, in roughly six hours, which I
think is not bad. I therefore also thank everybody for
their discipline.

There are no more names inscribed on the list
of speakers.

The meeting rose at 4.05 pm.
