Mr. Ma Zhaoxu (China) (spoke in Chinese):
China attaches great importance to combating sexual
violence in conflict and has alwaysfirmly supported the
international community in its efforts in that regard.

The Chinese delegation participated constructively
and responsibly in the consultations on the related draft
resolutions, proposing a number of recommendations
and amendments. We believe that the Council should
address sexual violence in conflict in line with its
mandate, instead ofgoing too far to address what should
have been entrusted to other bodies. consideringWith
regard to the establishment of special mechanisms,
it is important to have extensive discussions well in
advance. It is vital to fully respect the sovereignty ofhost
countries and support their Governments in playing a
leading role. We also believe that any related sanctions
measures should strictly comply with the Council's
mandates and be subject to case-by-case deliberations.
Regrettably, those propositions and concerns were
not fully reflected in resolution 2467 (2019). China
therefore had no option but to abstain in the voting on
it. I want to reiterate that China is willing to continue to
cooperate constructively with all the relevant parties in
order to tackle sexual violence in conflict.
