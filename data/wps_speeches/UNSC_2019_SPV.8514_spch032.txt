Mr. Kenes (Belgium) (spoke in French): At the
outset, I wish to reiterate that my country also welcomes
the adoption of resolution 2467 (2019). I believe that the
main message retained from that adoption is that the
resolution confirms the responsibility and legitimacy
of the Security Council in the fight against cases of
sexual violence in conflict - there is no doubt about
that for my country.

We welcome the adoption of today's resolution
and, as indicated in my statement earlier, Belgium
commends the progress represented by the resolution,
which also serves to explain our voting in support of the
resolution proposed by Germany. We regret, however,
that it has not been possible to respond to the needs of
victims with regard to sexual and reproductive health.
I can identify to a great extent with the statement just
made by the Ambassador of France.

I also wish to add that we regret that the essential
role of civil society in uncovering atrocities could not
be adequately reflected in the text. Other less important
issues are also worthy of our attention, but like the
Permanent Representative of France, I would also like
to conclude on an essential point that I made in my
earlier statement - for us, this resolution represents
an important step, but above all in view of the needs
of the victims, I believe that the Security Council
should continue its work and shift into a higher gear
going forward.
