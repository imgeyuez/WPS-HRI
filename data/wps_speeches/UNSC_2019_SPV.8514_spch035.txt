Lord Ahmad (United Kingdom): May I first
extend my congratulations to Germany on behalf of
the United Kingdom for having achieved a successful
outcome to resolution 2467 (2019). In doing so, may
I also attach myself totally in support of the remarks
made by the Ambassador of France in connection
with the achievements behind this resolution, while
also recognizing the important steps that remain for
the Security Council in ensuring that we truly do put
survivors at the heart of our approach. There are many
achievements behind this resolution, including three key
elements that I highlighted during my earlier statement.

First, there is a recognition of the survivor-centred
approach, although as our colleague from South Africa
has just pointed out, more steps need to be taken to
achieve true justice and accountability in that respect.
Secondly, the resolution does acknowledge conflict-
related sexual violence and its disproportionate impact
on women and girls. Thirdly, it acknowledges the
important role that civil society plays.

But again, it must be made clear - and that is why
I made this point in my original statement - that we
deeply regret the language on services provided for
survivors of sexual violence, recognizing the acute
need for those services to include comprehensive
reproductive and sexual health care. We were very clear
in that regard in my earlier statement.

I support the efforts made by other Security Council
members, including yourself, Mr. President, and the
efforts that Germany and France will continue to make,
as well as other colleagues, in ensuring that we keep
this important priority on our agenda. I assure you that
the United Kingdom will continue to support access
to sexual and reproductive health care for survivors of
sexual violence around the world - that is a priority. If
we are to have a survivor-centred approach, we cannot
ignore that important priority.
