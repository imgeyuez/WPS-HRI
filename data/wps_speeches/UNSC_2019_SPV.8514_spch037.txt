Ms. Murad (spoke in Arabic): I would like to
once again thank the German delegation for having
organized this important meeting, as well as the
Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict,
Ms. Pramila Patten.

Earlier, I asked that all members of the Security
Council vote in favour of resolution 2467 (2019), which
supports all victims of sexual violence. As a victim
myself, I believe that the resolution is a step in the right
direction. The adoption of the resolution must now be
followed by practical steps in order to achieve radical
changes on the ground. I stand together with male and
female survivors throughout the world in saying that
we depend on all present here in the Chamber to uphold
this resolution. Impunity is no longer an option. All
programmes and initiatives must focus on survivors as
their basis.
