Ms. Miloud: Iwould like to thank you, Mr. President,
for giving me the opportunity to voice the concerns
of my fellow Libyan women and indigenous people. I
would just like to respond by saying that a survivor-
centred approach does mean the availability of services
related to sexual and reproductive health, but it also
means the inclusion of those services for everyone and
leaving no one behind.

I also want to add that I may not know the destiny
that might face me or my colleagues when I leave the
Security Council today. This is a very critical moment
in our country and, as I said earlier, attacks against
women human rights defenders are on the rise. I would
just like to say that we are facing that risk today and we
are relying on the Security Council to take firm action
to protect women and girls and women human rights
defenders in Libya.
