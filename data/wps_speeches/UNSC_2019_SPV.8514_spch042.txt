The President: I wish to remind all speakers to
limit their statements to no more than four minutes
in order to enable the Council to carry out its work
expeditiously. Delegations with lengthy statements
are kindly requested to circulate the text in writing
and to deliver a condensed version when speaking in
the Chamber.

I also wish to inform all concerned that we will be
carrying on this open debate through the lunch hour, as
we have a very large number of speakers.

I now give the floor to the Minister for Foreign
Affairs and Trade of Hungary.
