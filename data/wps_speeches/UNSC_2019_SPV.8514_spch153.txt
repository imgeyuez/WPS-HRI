The President: Before I give the floor to
the representative of Sri Lanka, please allow
me - and I think I can speak on behalf of everyone in
the Chamber - to convey our sympathy and heartfelt
condolences for the victims of the heinous attacks
committed in that country. Our thoughts are with the
victims and their families.

I now give the floor on the representative of
Sri Lanka.
