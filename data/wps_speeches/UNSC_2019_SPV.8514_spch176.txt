Mr. Lee Jooil (Republic of Korea): I would
like to reply to the statement made by the Japanese
representative regarding the issue of comfort women.

The issue of comfort women has dimensions that go
beyond the bilateral relationship between the Republic
of Korea and Japan. It is indeed a matter of universal
human rights and, in particular, is related to sexual
violence in conflict, the resolution of which requires a
victim-centred approach. The Korean Government will
continue to cooperate with the international community
on this issue.
