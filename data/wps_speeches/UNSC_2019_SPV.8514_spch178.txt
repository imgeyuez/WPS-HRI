Mr. Furumoto (Japan): The Government of Japan
has long been sincerely dealing with the issue of
comfort women. In addition, as a result of considerable
diplomatic efforts, Japan and the Republic of Korea
reached an agreement in December 2015. With that
agreement, both countries confirmed that the issue
of comfort women had been finally and irreversibly
resolved. It is of great importance that the agreement
be strictly implemented.

The meeting rose at 8.15 pm.
