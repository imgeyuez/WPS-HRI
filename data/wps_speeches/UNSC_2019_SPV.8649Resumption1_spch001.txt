The President: As previously announced, given the
financial constraints currently being experienced by the
Organization, this afternoon's meeting will conclude at
exactly 6 pm. As there are likely to still be speakers
remaining on the list at that time, I am pleased to inform
the Security Council that, if necessary, this meeting
will be resumed at a date and time to be announced
in the month of November under the presidency of the
United Kingdom, hopefully soon.

The representative of the United Kingdom has
asked for the floor.
