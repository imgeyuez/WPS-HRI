The President: I thank the representative of the
United Kingdom; that is appreciated.

Iwish to remind all speakers to limit their statements
to no more than four minutes in order to enable the
Council to carry out its work expeditiously. Delegations
with lengthy statements are kindly requested to circulate
their texts in writing and to deliver a condensed version
when speaking in the Chamber. The red light on the
collar of the microphone in front of speakers will
begin to flash after four minutes have elapsed. Please
respect that.

I now give the floor to the Minister of Foreign
Affairs of Guatemala.
