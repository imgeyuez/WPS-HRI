The President: There are a number of speakers
remaining on the list for this meeting. I intend to
suspend the meeting now, to be resumed at a date and
time to be announced in the month of November, under
the presidency of the United Kingdom.

On behalf of the Council, I would like to thank
the interpreters, information and publicity officials,
engineers and security officers for donating a total of
23 minutes to advance the cause of women and peace
and security.

The meeting was suspended at 6.05 p.m.
