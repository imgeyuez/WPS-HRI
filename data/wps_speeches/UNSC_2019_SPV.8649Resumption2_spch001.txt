The President: I would like to ask all speakers to
limit their statements to no more than four minutes in
order to enable everyone who has asked to speak to be
able to do so. As members know, this is a continuation
of the debate held under the South African presidency.
We have only this afternoon to continue it, and we need
to finish by 6 pm. We have divided 180 minutes by
42 speakers, which allows for speaking time of four
minutes each. I would ask colleagues to keep to that
time limit. I am afraid I will interrupt in the interest of
giving everyone a chance to speak. Delegations with
long statements are of course very welcome to circulate
them in the Chamber. The red light on the microphone
will begin to flash after four minutes. I would invite
those sitting behind colleagues who are speaking to
keep an eye out for that.

Inow give the floor to the representative of Slovakia.
