The President: I wish to thank the representative
of Greece in particular for keeping to the time limit
because, as some delegations will have heard before,
we are limited to four minutes per speaker. If we do
not do that, then not every country and organization
will be able to speak today. I remind representatives
that their microphone will flash after four minutes and
it would be great if their colleagues could bring it to
their attention should they not see it. I will have to ask
representatives to bring their remarks to a close if they
do not.

I now give the floor to the representative of Djibouti.
