The President: As we are a little behind time, I
once again urge speakers to limit their statements
to four minutes. I remind them that the collar of the
microphone will begin to flash after four minutes has
elapsed, at which time one of my colleagues will come
around to encourage the speaker to finish. Otherwise, I
regret that I will be forced to cut the speaker off.

I now give the floor to the representative
of Liechtenstein.
