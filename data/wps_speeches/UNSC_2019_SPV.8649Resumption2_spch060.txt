Mr. Sacco (Malta): Malta aligns itself with
the statement delivered by the observer of the
European Union.

I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for
having resumed this meeting today to discuss the
implementation of the women and peace and security
agenda, which contributes to the preparations for
the twentieth anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000),
next year.

We are aware that much remains to be done in the
area of the participation of women and girls in matters
related to peace and security, such as their involvement
in decision-making and in terms of the prevention of
and protection from conflict-related violence.

Violence against women and girls in conflict
situations continues and is exacerbated by the peace and
security challenges that the international community
faces, including mass migration and displacement,
rising violent extremism and terrorism, conflict and
the proliferation of arms. Our efforts to change this
must continue.

Since Malta announced its commitment to adopt
our first national action plan on women and peace
and security in April, work has been well under way.
We remain convinced that it is important to ensure
that women and girls in conflict, post-conflict and
fragile situations can, on an equal basis, participate in
all political, economic, security and social aspects of
their societies. This is a prerequisite for the creation
of inclusive and peaceful societies, sustainable
development and peace. By embarking on our women
and peace and security journey, Malta is doing its part
to close the implementation gap. We fully support the
United Nations in its work on this agenda.

The twentieth anniversary of the adoption of
resolution 1325 (2000) will provide us all with an
opportunity to take stock of not only the achievements
made but also the challenges facing us as we look ahead
to the women and peace and security agenda.
