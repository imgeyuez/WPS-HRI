Mr. Duarte Lopes (Portugal): Having co-sponsored
resolution 2493 (2019), Portugal welcomes its adoption.
We are pleased with the achievements identified in
the Secretary-General's report (S/2019/800). But, as
the report also underlines, the women and peace and
security agenda is still held up by many challenges,
including the growth of violent misogyny and the
persistence of sexual and gender-based violence as
a weapon of war and terror. In that respect, Portugal
will continue to fight the threats against women's and
girls' human rights worldwide and to support efforts
to strengthen them, especially in conflict and post-
conflict areas. We will continue to push back against
the pushback on women's rights.

We cannot forget that conflict also adversely affects
the education of millions of children. In countries
affected by conflict, the situation is extremely hard for
all children, but girls are often left even further behind.
For the majority of them, that means the end of school.
Empowering women and girls through education is the
best way to guarantee equal rights and full participation
in society. Portugal reiterates the importance ofthe Safe

Schools Declaration as a fundamental tool to prevent
sexual violence and encourages more Member States
to adhere to it.

In the beginning of this year, we adopted our third
national action plan to implement resolution 1325 (2000).
The strategic objectives of the action plan include,
among others, promoting equality between women and
men in matters of security and development, protecting
women's and girls' human rights and combating all
forms of violence and sexual violence, increasing
the number of women participating in international
missions and supporting the work of civil society
organizations in women, peace and security matters.

In conclusion, sustainable development cannot
be achieved without safeguarding women's and
girls' human rights. We cannot leave one half of
humankind behind.
