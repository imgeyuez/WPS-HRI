Mr. Pecsteen de Buytswerve (Belgium) (spoke in French): Belgium congratulates South Africa on
the adoption of resolution 2493 (2019), on women and
peace and security. Our vote in favour of the resolution
reflects my country's full commitment to the agenda
and the empowerment of women. On the eve of the
twentieth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325
(2000), we welcome the stress placed on the importance
of implementing our joint commitments.

However, we regret that it was not possible today to
adopt a resolution that would have underlined the key
role of human rights defenders in the implementation
of the women and peace and security. In addition, we
regret that the Security Council was not in a position
to call on countries to adopt measures to protect civil
society and safeguard critical thinking and the freedom
of expression.

As with previous Council debates on related issues,
we would also like to highlight that it is clear that
the full implementation of resolutions on women and
peace and security means fully implementing all the
provisions of all of the Council's resolutions pertinent
to this agenda item, including provisions on sexual and
reproductive health.

In this spirit, we eagerly look forward to engaging
with all members in the course of the year during which
we will mark the twentieth anniversary of resolution
1325 (2000).
