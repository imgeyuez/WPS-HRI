Ms. Miintefering (Germany): We thank South
Africa for highlighting the importance of the women
and peace and security agenda with today's resolution
2493 (2019). With its adoption, the Security Council
has once more underlined the crucial role it attaches to
the full, equal and meaningful participation of women
in prevention, peace processes and relief and recovery.
This is the tenth time that the Security Council has
adopted a resolution on women and peace and security,
which has been a German priority since the very first
time, 19 years ago. We agree that implementation is key
in making progress, but we still have a long way to go.

The resolution serves as a reminder that it is our
obligation as Member States to redouble our efforts
to ensure the full implementation of resolution 1325
(2000) and all subsequent resolutions that form part of
the women and peace and security agenda, with all
their provisions. The resolution highlights a crucial
element of the implementation of the women and peace
and security agenda, namely, the role of civil society.
That includes international and local non-governmental
organizations, formal and informal community women
leaders, women peacebuilders, political actors and
women human rights defenders, all of whom play an
indispensable role in the implementation of the women
and peace and security agenda.

We are strongly concerned about attacks and
reprisals against women activists, human rights
defenders and civil society in general, as well as about
the concerted efforts by some States to backtrack on
the women and peace and security agenda and on the
universality of all human rights. We stand united with
many Member States of the Council and the United
Nations - as we heard from the representatives of
Belgium and the United Kingdom - as well as with
civil society to resist such efforts.
