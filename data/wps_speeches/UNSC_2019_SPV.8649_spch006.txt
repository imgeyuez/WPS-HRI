Mrs. Gueguen (France) (spoke in French): France
thanks South Africa for its efforts in a difficult context
and welcomes the Security Council's unity. This is a
victory for the women and peace and security agenda,
which will mark its twentieth anniversary next year.
France welcomes the fact that resolution 2493 (2019)
calls for the full implementation of all resolutions on
this agenda, which are mutually reinforcing and to
which France is committed in all their aspects.

We would have liked the role of civil society and
women human rights defenders to be fully recognized.
Indeed, how can one envisage implementing the women
and peace and security agenda without civil society and
those women on the ground who try to change the status
quo to demand the role that belongs to them.

It is regrettable that the Security Council
continues to be silent on the crucial issue of sexual and
reproductive health and rights, without which women's
rights remain in jeopardy and we cannot respond to
the most basic needs of the victims of sexual violence
throughout the world.

In conclusion, I would like to reaffirm that
France will continue to support the full - and
demanding - implementation of the women and peace
and security agenda, including the full complement of
all related resolutions.
