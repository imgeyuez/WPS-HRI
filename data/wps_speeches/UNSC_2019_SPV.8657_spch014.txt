The President: Before we continue, I would like
to say that there will be another opportunity to pay
a proper and full tribute to Mr. Jonathan Cohen later
in the week. We will inform members of the Security
Council when that will take place. For those who are
going to Greentree, I believe that they will be able to
do that there.
