The President: I thank Her Excellency
Ms. Mohammed for the clarifications she has provided.

I would like to remind colleagues about the
five-minute rule regarding the delivery of statements.
As it is difficult for speakers to see their own microphone
flashing if they speak for more than five minutes but
it is very visible to everyone else around the table, I
would invite those sitting behind their Ambassadors, as
a kindness, to make them aware.

The meeting rose at 11.55 am.
