      "Text": "Mr. Kau (Fiji): We would like to thank you,  Mr. President, for having organized today's debate on  this issue. We also congratulate the Secretary-General  for his timely report on the follow-up to the full  implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) on women  and peace and security (S/2004/814).    While the Secretary-General's report shows that  there have been positive developments in the  implementation of the resolution, further concerted  efforts are needed to ensure that the issue of  implementation is fully addressed. The full  implementation of the resolution will continue to be a  challenge for the Security Council and for the United  Nations.  Fiji attaches great importance to this subject, and  we commend the efforts made thus far by the Security  Council, the General Assembly, the Economic and  Social Council and its functional commissions and  other United Nations bodies and entities. We  commend, in particular, the efforts made by the United  Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and  by regional organizations and other bodies, including  the Commonwealth Secretariat, which have been active  partners in following up this issue in Fiji. Our Ministry  for Women, Social Welfare and Poverty Alleviation has  been the focal point of efforts to mainstream gender  perspectives in relation to critical peace and security  components in Government and other areas.    The necessary groundwork for the launching in  Fiji of national policies and strategies pursuant to  resolution 1325 (2000) has been greatly boosted by the  sponsorship and support of UNIFEM. and other actors,  including civil society. Work on mainstreaming gender  perspectives in relation to conflict prevention,  peacekeeping operations, humanitarian assistance and  post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation is in  progress.    Recent political and internal upheavals in our  country have brought out the best in our women, and  their contribution has been a strong factor for good and  steady progress. They have been effective stabilizers  and mediators in conflict prevention and very active  players in recent efforts in post-conflict peace-building  and reconciliation processes. A week-long peace and  reconciliation process with the objective, inter alia, of  uniting our polarized and divided country, which was  held last month, saw women and children playing key  roles. This was preceded by a national workshop on  conflict prevention and early warning.    In peacekeeping, Fiji, which is a staunch  supporter of and consistent contributor to international  peacekeeping missions, has introduced specific  measures to ensure the expansion of women's role in  peacekeeping. Despite the difficulties in overcoming  cultural and traditional barriers, recent deployments  have seen the successful integration of women into  various specialized duties, including guard duty. The  military and police departments, together with other  relevant bodies, are working on coherent strategies for  gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping. The Fiji  peacekeeping deployment to Iraq will include six  women who have been given specific training in  searching and in counselling. That also illustrates our  view that women can be as good as men in all areas if  given the opportunity.  We fully agree with the Secretary-General that  more effort must be put into capacity-building and  training. Gender mainstreaming in relation to all facets  of peace and security requires knowledge and  information-sharing. Training and capacity-building  must target not only girls and women, but also boys  and men at all levels of government and the  community. It should be all-encompassing and  comprehensive, targeting both the formal and the non-  formal sectors. Its inclusion in the education  curriculum will ensure early intervention and sustained  impact. The Government, through the programmes of  its Ministry for Women and through the UNIFEM-  sponsored Women and Peace and Security Committee,  is addressing the issue with all relevant stakeholders.    In addition, there is a need for more effective  coordination and partnerships. There is certainly no  lack of will and enthusiasm at the national level,  particularly in developing countries, but enhanced  cooperation and partnership are vital to ensure the  inflow of the resources and expertise which are  generally lacking in our countries. We therefore  welcome the call by the Secretary-General for the  development and strengthening of cooperation and  effective partnerships at all levels. We acknowledge the  good work done by UNIFEM. and other United Nations  bodies, together with regional organizations such as the  Pacific Islands Forum and the Commonwealth  Secretariat, in the Pacific region, including in Fiji. We  can only hope for more such cooperation and  partnerships.    We also commend the Secretary-General for his  recognition of the role of indigenous women in conflict  resolution as mediators and peace-builders. Indigenous  and local women have a strong advocacy role, and it  should be utilized in all aspects of security and peace.    There is a need to ensure that national and  international efforts for the implementation of  resolution 1325 (2000) are undertaken in a  comprehensive manner in the context of the  Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of  Discrimination against Women and the Beijing  Declaration and Platform for Action. To ensure  complementarity"

      "Text": "Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): I would  like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for    joining us at this important meeting of the Security  Council. We would also like to welcome to the Council  Chamber Mr. Bedouma Alain Yoda, Minister for  Foreign Affairs of Burkina Faso, and Mr. Alain  Joyandet, Minister of State for Cooperation and  Francophonie of France.    I would like in particular to welcome you,  Madam Secretary of State, and to acknowledge your  personal commitment and leadership, which have  created renewed impetus for the issue of the protection  of women's rights and the prevention of all forms of  violence against women. My delegation would also  like to thank the delegation of the United States for  leading negotiations on resolution 1888 (2009), which  has just been adopted.    With the unanimous adoption of that resolution,  the Security Council has reaffirmed its commitment to  the protection of women in armed conflict. The  significant number of delegations that joined in  sponsoring this initiative shows that the international  community is resolved to ensure that women and  children no longer remain the principal victims of the  armed conflicts which, deplorably, are occurring in  many parts of the world.    Council members were able to see for ourselves  the gravity of the acts of sexual violence against  women and children in areas of armed conflict in the  course of our visit to a number of African countries last  May, in particular the Democratic Republic of the  Congo. On that occasion we witnessed the  consequences of these crimes for societies and their  negative impact on efforts to find solutions to crisis  situations and promote an effective process of national  reconciliation. For that reason we wish to reiterate, as  does resolution 1888 (2009), the primary obligation of  all parties to an armed conflict to respect and to  enforce at all times international humanitarian law,  which grants special protection to women and children.    My delegation believes that the establishment of  the post of Special Representative of the Secretary-  General on sexual violence in situations of armed  conflict will make it possible to improve the systematic  and comprehensive attention that the United Nations  pays in response to sexual violence in these situations.    This new mandate should work in a coordinated  manner with other United Nations mechanisms and  agencies in order to harness synergies and to prevent  duplication. In particular, there is a broad relationship    between the objectives of resolution 1888 (2009) and  resolution 1882 (2009), on children and armed conflict,  which was adopted by the Security Council last  August.    These common objectives must be duly explored  with a view to providing comprehensive protection for  all those who, due to their condition, suffer most from  the consequences of armed conflict, that is, women and  children. In the light of the aforementioned, we believe  that the Security Council must also pay close attention  to the ongoing negotiations on a composite gender  entity within the framework of the General Assembly  and decide to review the mandate of the Special  Representative in a reasonable period of time and in  the light of the results of the procedure outlined in  General Assembly resolution 63/311.    While more can be done at the international level  in order to prevent sexual violence in situations of  armed conflict, the eradication of sexual violence will  only be achieved if national capacities among those  States that are addressing situations of conflict are  improved with a view to bringing the perpetrators of  such crimes to justice.    Therefore, one of the most relevant aspects of the  resolution is the identification within the United  Nations of a multidisciplinary team of experts who,  when their assistance is required and with the consent  of the State concerned, can be deployed to the field in  order to work jointly with the Government and the  United Nations system to undertake projects for  technical cooperation to strengthen the rule of law,  prevent impunity and address victims' needs.    It is clear that currently we have strong tools for  preventing sexual violence in areas of conflict. The  true challenge that we face is making full use of this  array of instruments, if we truly wish to ensure that  more women and children do not fall victim to the  spiral of violence that is caused by armed conflict."

      "Text": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding the task. I need to annotate the given UN Security Council speech with Hero, Villain, or Victim tags based on the guidelines provided. The key is to identify entities (people, organizations, countries, groups, UN resolutions if personified) and determine their roles as per the speaker's portrayal.\n\nFirst, I'll go through the speech paragraph by paragraph. The speaker is from Senegal, addressing a debate on women, peace, and security. The initial part has thanks to various officials. According to guideline 4d, speakers at the beginning separated by a colon shouldn't be tagged. So \"Mr. Diallo (Senegal)\" and others mentioned in the opening are not tagged.\n\nLooking at the first paragraph after the colon: \"I would like to convey my delegation's sincere congratulations...\" The phrase \"my delegation\" is a possessive NP. Guideline 1c says to include possessive modifiers, so \"my delegation\". \n\nNext, he thanks several people: the Secretary-General, Mr. Lazarous Kapambwe, Ms. Michelle Bachelet, Ms. Orzala Ashraf Nemat. These are all individuals contributing to the cause. Since they're part of the same NP and share a role (being thanked for contributions), the entire list is a Hero. So \"the Secretary-General... civil society\".\n\nMoving on, \"resolution 1325 (2000)\" is mentioned as a step forward. UN resolutions are tagged if personified. The text says it \"represented an enormous step...\", which is personification. So \"resolution 1325 (2000)\". Later mentions of resolutions 1820, etc., are part of the same NP and share the Hero role, so the entire list is tagged as Hero.\n\nThe next paragraph talks about \"persistent shortcomings\" exposing \"thousands of women and girls\" to abuse. \"Women and girls\" are victims here, so \"thousands of women and girls\". \n\nRape as a weapon of war: the perpetrators (villains) aren't explicitly mentioned, but the victims are \"women\" again. However, the sentence structure doesn't name the villains, so focus on victims. \"sexual and gender-based violence\" is an abstract concept, so not tagged. \"vulnerable group\" refers to women, so \"that vulnerable group of the population\".\n\nThe international community is called to combat impunity. \"international community\" is a Hero as they're taking action. So \"the international community\".\n\nNext, \"zero tolerance policy on sexual violence of the Secretary-General\" – the Secretary-General is a Hero. \"the Secretary-General\". \n\nLow participation of women in strategies: \"women\" here are excluded from decision-making, making them Victims. \"the continuing low participation of women\". \n\nLater, \"foster women's participation\" – here, women are being empowered, so Hero. \"women's participation\". Also, \"women's empowerment\" is both Hero (active role) and Victim (needing empowerment), so combined tag \"women's empowerment\".\n\nSenegal's actions: \"my country\" is Hero. \"my country\". \"national gender-parity monitoring body\" is an organization taking action, Hero. \"a national gender-parity monitoring body\".\n\n\"Senegal has already adopted... resolution 1325 (2000)\" – resolution 1325 again as Hero. \"resolution 1325 (2000)\". \n\nECOWAS and Dakar Declaration: organizations contributing positively, Hero. \"the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)\" and \"the Dakar Declaration\".\n\n\"UN-Women and all of the other relevant bodies\" – Hero organizations. \"UN-Women\" and \"all of the other relevant bodies\".\n\nAppeal against illicit trade in arms: the illicit trade is a Villain causing harm. But the entities here are the \"illicit trade in small arms and light weapons\" – abstract concept? Wait, guideline 4a says not to tag abstract concepts. But \"illicit trade\" is a group causing harm. Hmm, maybe not. The appeal is to combat it, so the trade itself is a Villain. But according to the guidelines, groups are taggable. So \"the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons\".\n\n\"diplomatic conference of 2012\" – an event, not an entity. Not tagged. \n\nFinally, \"Security Council\" is an organization being called to action, Hero. \"the Security Council\". \"resolution 1325 (2000)\" again as Hero. \"resolution 1325 (2000)\".\n\nI need to ensure that all tags are correctly applied without overlapping unless necessary. Also, check for combined roles. For example, \"women's empowerment\" is both Hero and Victim. \n\nWait, in the example given, \"women’s empowerment\" is tagged as HER_VIC because they need empowerment (Victim) but contribute as Heroes. Here, the speaker says \"special focus on women's empowerment, which will require significant investment...\" So empowerment here is about enabling women, thus they are both victims needing help and heroes in their role. So combined tag.\n\nAlso, check for possessive cases like \"women's participation\" – guideline 4a says not to tag abstract concepts, but \"women\" is the entity. So \"women's participation\" – \"participation\" is abstract, but \"women's\" is possessive. The example says in \"women’s participation\", women are the entity taking action, so tag \"women’s\" as HER. But in another example, if it's \"women's empowerment\", and empowerment is both helping them (Victim) and them being Heroes, then combined. So here, \"women's participation\" is tagged as HER because they are agents, but in another part, \"women's empowerment\" is HER_VIC.\n\nAnother point: when the speaker mentions \"the effective participation of women in decision-making processes\", \"women\" here are being included, so Victim (excluded before, now being included). But also, their participation makes them Heroes. So combined HER_VIC? Or based on the context. The sentence says \"ensure the effective participation of women in decision-making processes.\" The women are being given a role, so they were excluded (Victim) and now participating (Hero). So \"women\".\n\nBut need to check the exact wording. The guideline says to tag based on portrayal. If the speaker is highlighting their role as participants, it's Hero. If they were previously excluded, that's Victim. But in the current sentence, it's about ensuring their participation, which is empowering, so maybe Hero. However, the prior sentence mentions the law to establish parity, implying they were excluded (Victim). So in the sentence \"Senegal intends to ensure the effective participation of women...\", \"women\" are both previously victims and now heroes. But the current mention is about their participation, which is Heroic. So maybe just HER. But according to the example, when empowerment is both, it's combined. Hmm.\n\nThis is tricky. The guidelines say to combine roles if the entity is portrayed in multiple roles. Here, the women are being given a role (Hero) but were previously victims. However, in the current sentence, the focus is on their participation as a positive role, so maybe just HER. But the overall context might imply they're still victims needing empowerment. I think in the sentence about empowerment, it's HER_VIC, but in the participation sentence, it's HER. Need to be context-specific.\n\nAlso, \"vulnerable group\" is tagged as VIC. \"vulnerable group of the population\" refers to women, so \"that vulnerable group of the population\".\n\nAnother part: \"the poor results in that area have undoubtedly been due to the continuing low participation of women...\" Here, \"women\" have low participation, so they're excluded (Victim). So \"the continuing low participation of women\".\n\nIn the part where he says \"foster women's participation by reserving a key role for them...\", \"women's participation\" is the NP. The possessive \"women's\" is part of the NP. Since participation is an abstract concept, but \"women's\" is the entity. Since they are being given a key role, it's Heroic. So \"women's participation\".\n\nWait, but guideline 4a says not to tag abstract concepts, but \"participation\" is abstract. However, the example given in guidelines shows \"women’s participation\" where \"women’s\" is tagged as HER. So in that case, \"women's participation\" would have \"women's\" tagged as HER, but \"participation\" is not. But the guidelines say to include the entire NP. Wait, the example says: “women as agents of peace” – here, \"women\" is tagged, not the entire phrase. But in another example, “parties that perpetuate acts of violence against women and children” – the entire NP including the relative clause.\n\nSo for \"women's participation\", the NP is \"women's participation\", but \"participation\" is an abstract concept. However, guideline 1c says to include possessive modifiers. So \"women's participation\" is a NP with possessive, so the entire phrase is tagged. But according to guideline 4a, if it's an abstract concept like \"participation\", do we tag it? The example in guidelines shows that \"women's participation\" is tagged as HER because the entity is women, and the participation is their action. But guideline 4a says not to tag abstract concepts, but women are the entity. So perhaps \"women's participation\" is tagged as HER because the women are the heroes, and their participation is their role. So \"women's participation\".\n\nSimilarly, \"women's empowerment\" is \"women's empowerment\" because empowerment implies they are victims needing help but also heroes in contributing.\n\nAnother point: \"the Dakar Declaration by focusing on the four following areas...\" – the Declaration is an organization/entity, so Hero.\n\nAlso, \"UN-Women\" is an organization, so Hero. Similarly, \"ECOWAS\" is an organization, Hero.\n\nIn the part about the arms trade treaty, \"illicit trade in small arms and light weapons\" is a group causing harm, so Villain. So \"the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons\".\n\nThe \"diplomatic conference of 2012\" is an event, not an entity, so not tagged.\n\nFinally, \"the Security Council\" is an organization being called to action, Hero. \"the Security Council\".\n\nI need to make sure that all tags are correctly applied, including nested tags where necessary. Also, check for combined roles when applicable. For example, when women are both victims and heroes in the same mention.\n\nAnother example: \"the effective prevention of all forms of violence against women\" – \"women\" here are victims of violence. So \"women\".\n\nIn the sentence \"rape continues to be used as a weapon of war...\", the perpetrators are not mentioned, so only the victims \"women\" are tagged, but the sentence structure doesn't name the villains. So \"rape\" is an abstract concept, not tagged. The victims are \"women\" but the phrase is \"women and girls\" earlier.\n\nWait, in the sentence \"persistent shortcomings have exposed thousands of women and girls to various types of barbaric abuse and atrocities.\" Here, \"thousands of women and girls\" are victims. So \"thousands of women and girls\".\n\nIn \"sexual and gender-based violence, even at the end of a conflict, represents an almost permanent threat to the security and health of that vulnerable group of the population.\" \"that vulnerable group\" refers to women, so \"that vulnerable group of the population\".\n\nIn \"vigorously combating impunity\", the villains are those causing impunity, but they aren't named. So no tag here.\n\nWhen he says \"I would like to launch an appeal for coordinated and focused action against the illicit trade...\", the trade is the villain. So \"the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons\".\n\nAlso, \"Senegal has already adopted its national action plan...\" – \"Senegal\" is a country taking action, Hero. \"Senegal\".\n\nWait, earlier mentions of \"my country\" refer to Senegal, so \"my country\".\n\nIn the part about the national action plan for resolution 1325, \"resolution 1325 (2000)\" is again personified, so Hero.\n\nThe \"Dakar Declaration\" is an entity, Hero.\n\n\"UN-Women\" is an organization, Hero.\n\n\"all of the other relevant bodies\" – Hero.\n\n\"peacekeeping operations\" – abstract, not tagged.\n\n\"the Security Council\" – Hero.\n\nNow, applying all these tags step by step, ensuring that the original spacing and punctuation are preserved. Also, make sure not to tag the speaker's own delegation or country unless they are portrayed as heroes, which they are in this case because they are taking positive actions.\n\nAnother check: \"the establishment of the post of the Special Representative...\" – guideline 1g says not to tag positions mentioned in the abstract. So even if the Special Representative is a person, if it's just the post being mentioned, not tagged. But in this speech, the Special Representative isn't mentioned, so no issue.\n\nAlso, \"Ms. Michelle Bachelet, Executive Director of UN-Women\" – \"UN-Women\" is an organization, so \"UN-Women\".\n\nIn the list of thanked individuals, \"Mr. Lazarous Kapambwe, President of the Economic and Social Council, Ms. Michelle Bachelet... civil society\" – all these are part of the same NP, so tagged as Hero.\n\nNow, let's reconstruct the speech with the tags:\n\nStarting with the speaker line, which isn't tagged. Then:\n\n\"I would  like to convey my delegation's sincere congratulations  for the convening of this important debate on women,  peace and security, which represents, Madam  President, the crowning moment of your remarkable  presidency of the Council for the month of October. I  would like to thank the Secretary-General for his  statement, as well as Mr. Lazarous Kapambwe,  President of the Economic and Social Council,  Ms. Michelle Bachelet, Executive Director of  UN-Women, and Ms. Orzala Ashraf Nemat,  representative of civil society for their important  contributions.\"\n\nNext paragraph:\n\n\"My delegation has a special interest in the topic,  because resolution 1325 (2000) represented an  enormous step forward in the protection of women and  highlighted the importance of their role in all aspects  of United Nations peacekeeping. Nonetheless, while it  has remained far from being a cure-all, resolution 1325  (2000) has contributed, along with resolutions 1820  (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1889 (2009), to improving the  normative framework for preventing gender-based  violence and for protecting women against that  scourge.\"\n\nNext:\n\n\"It should, however, be pointed out that, despite  those praiseworthy efforts, persistent shortcomings  have exposed thousands of women and girls to various  types of barbaric abuse and atrocities. In fact, rape  continues to be used as a weapon of war in certain  conflict areas, and the ongoing existence of sexual and  gender-based violence, even at the end of a conflict,  represents an almost permanent threat to the security  and health of that vulnerable group of the population.  That is why the international community must firmly  commit to vigorously combating impunity in order to  guarantee the effective prevention of all forms of  violence against women.\"\n\nNext paragraph:\n\n\"While welcoming the zero tolerance policy on  sexual violence of the Secretary-General, we must, in  addition, insist on the need to bolster the role of  women in conflict-prevention and resolution.  Nevertheless, the poor results in that area have  undoubtedly been due to the continuing low  participation of women in the drafting of  implementation strategies. I consider it crucial,  therefore, to foster women's participation by reserving  a key role for them in conflict-prevention policies, as  well as policies on peacekeeping, peacebuilding and  social and economic recovery. In that context, there  must be a special focus on women's empowerment,  which will require significant investment in education,  training and maternal health.\"\n\nNext:\n\n\"In View of our considerable awareness of that  dynamic process, my country has allocated a  significant part of its budget to education and health,  and on 14 May 2010, it adopted a law to establish full  parity in all partially or fully elected bodies. In that  manner, Senegal intends to ensure the effective  participation of women in decision-making processes.  To follow up on that law, a national gender-parity  monitoring body was set up and will be officially  inaugurated on 16 November.\"\n\nNext:\n\n\"Senegal has already adopted its national action  plan to implement resolution 1325 (2000).  Furthermore, it has sought to make a positive  contribution to drafting the action plan of the  Economic Community of West African States  (ECOWAS) and the Dakar Declaration by focusing on  the four following areas: first, effective participation of  women in the peace process; secondly, protection of  women and girls; thirdly, prevention of gender-based  violence through preventive diplomacy and early  warning systems, and fourthly, reconstruction and  victim assistance.\"\n\nNext paragraph:\n\n\"It is certain that those significant national and  regional level initiatives are welcome. However, they  will achieve the desired success only if linked with an  international dynamic inspired by the Security Council  and based on coordinated efforts on the part of  UN-Women and all of the other relevant bodies. There  is also a need to improve women's involvement in  peacekeeping operations by following up on the  laudable efforts already carried out in that domain.\"\n\nNext:\n\n\"The effective prevention of sexual violence also"

      "Text": "Mr. Laassel (Morocco) (spoke in French): Allow  me at the outset to convey to you, Sir, on behalf of the  Moroccan delegation, our gratitude for the convening  of this debate. I thank for their briefings Secretary-  General Ban Ki-moon; Ms. Navanethem Pillay, High  Commissioner for Human Rights; and Ms. Phumzile  Mlambo-Ngcuka, Executive Director of UN Women.  I welcome Ms. Mlambo-Ngcuka's appointment and  assure her of our full cooperation and support as she  discharges her mission. We also thank Ms. Brigitte  Balipou, Chair of the NGO Working Group on Women,  Peace and Security, for her constructive contribution.    My delegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-  General on women, peace and security (S/2013/525)  and the adoption of resolution 2122 (2013) on the issue.  The report takes stock of the actions and initiatives of  Member States in the framework of implementation  of the resolution, especially in strengthening women's  participation in decision-making, integrating gender-  specific issues in peacekeeping operations and  training staff who participate in those operations.  The report confirms that much work remains, despite  the significant progress of women's participation in  peacekeeping operations and their representation in the  decision-making process.    The signing of peace agreements and ceasefire  agreements and the implementation of national action  plans and programmes for the protection of women in  conflict-affected countries have made it possible to  identify, in a more appropriate way, the ways and means  likely to promote women's rights and to strengthen their  participation in efforts to prevent and resolve conflicts  and in post-conflict reconstruction.    My delegation supports the initiatives of the Team  of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in  Conflict to assist States in strengthening the rule of  law, transitional justice and security sector reform. My  delegation also supports the elaboration by the Standing  Committee on Women, Peace and Security of the  strategic framework intended to assist Member States  in achieving their interim objectives, in preparation for  the meeting planned for 2015 on the implementation  of resolution 1325 (2000) at national, regional and  international levels.    Effective and optimal empowerment of women  in the context of peacebuilding and post-conflict  reconstruction involves the collective and coordinated  action of the international community and the United  Nations system, through strengthening protection and  prevention measures adapted to specific contexts that  will facilitate the implementation of the resolution.    The establishment of genuine peace requires  the establishment of inclusive and durable political,  economic and social structures. Within that  framework, local women's entities are a driving  force in empowering women and strengthening good  governance. My delegation welcomes the work carried  out in the framework of the United Nations system  to strengthen women's capacities and involvement in  mediation and peacebuilding processes. Similarly, it  supports the implementation of the Secretary-General's  seven-point action plan (see S/2010/466), which enables  greater consideration of gender issues in peacebuilding  operations.    As for protection, my delegation notes with concern  that refugee or displaced women continue to suffer most  from generalized insecurity, difficult living conditions  and limited access to humanitarian assistance. The  same is true for refugee women who lack documents  and often face gender-based discrimination, especially  in accessing basic social services. In that connection,  it is essential that Member States - especially the  States parties to the 1951 Convention relating to the  Status of Refugees - comply with their obligations  and register refugees in their territory. Registration and  identification programmes can have a positive impact  in empowering women refugees.    My delegation welcomes the efforts undertaken  by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations  (DPKO) in the protection of women in armed conflict  and the consideration of gender-specific issues in the  framework of the maintenance of peace. We stress that  it is important that DPKO strengthen its work on the  ground, in coordination with the relevant parties.    While the responsibility to put an end to the tragic  consequences of armed conflict for women and children  lies with States, coordinated and sustained action  among the various national and United Nations actors  involved in the implementation of resolution 1325  (2000) is necessary to strengthen existing initiatives.    Firm political will and full commitment of Member  States to the measures in resolution 1325 (2000)  will guarantee the active participation of women in  national, regional and international institutions for  the prevention, protection and management of conflict  situations."

      "Text": "Mr. Gata Mavita wa Lufuta (Democratic Republic of the Congo) (spoke in French): First of all, I  would like to thank France for organizing this debate.  I also commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  and his Special Representative Zainab Bangura, as  well as all those who spoke before me, for their very  useful presentations.    Sexual violence in conflict situations is a scourge  from which my country, the Democratic Republic of  the Congo, has long suffered. For more than a decade,  my country has experienced especially bloody armed  conflicts in the eastern part of its territory. Those  conflicts, which have caused many human casualties,  are at the source ofthe practice ofusing rape as a weapon  of war. The lives of thousands of girls, women, boys  and men have thus been disrupted. The consequences  of the situation psychologically, economically and in  medical terms are enormous.    This debate affords us an opportunity to once again  touch on the efforts of my country's Government to  combat this situation. The restoration of peace in the  part of the country formerly occupied by rebel armed  groups has brought major change. Enormous progress  has been made both in the fight against sexual violence  and at the level of responding to the needs of victims.  In referring to my country, the report (S/2016/36l) of  the Secretary-General attests to that in mentioning  the appreciable 80 per cent decline in the number of  cases of sexual violence in conflict areas. Among other  things, my Government attributes those results to the  following elements: the appointment of a personal  representative of the President of the Republic in charge  of the fight against sexual violence and the recruitment  of children; the adoption of a plan of action to combat  sexual violence among the armed forces and the  signing ofajoint communique on the issue between the  Government and the United Nations; the adoption of a  zero-tolerance policy; and the signing by the Minister  of National Defence of a decree on the responsibility  of the unit commanders of the Forces armees de la  Republique democratique du Congo for combating  sexual violence.    All of those steps reflect the will of the Government  to end this scourge and honour its international  commitments. Against that backdrop, the Government  is committed to addressing the various problems,  including deliveringjustice in the fight against impunity.  In that connection, 111 cases were decided in 2015 by  the military justice system, without regard for the rank  ofthe accused. We have also established a compensation  fund, while two Senate committees, on sexual violence  and on political, administrative and judicial issues, are    working on a bill proposed by the office of the personal  representative of the Head of State. On preventing  sexual violence, a regional campaign called \"Breaking  the Silence\" will be launched by September. On  socioeconomic reintegration, with the collaboration of  our national institute for professional training, training  was organized at Kibumba last September in various  economic sectors for survivors and demobilized  fighters. That type of training will continue this year  in Rutshuru in North Kivu and in Bunia and Aru in  Ituri and will train 2,000 people. A $35,000 credit fund  was set up to meet the financial needs of some women  in Bunia. That progress has been made possible thanks  to the Government's own resources, with the technical  support of the international community, including  assistance from Japan via Ms. Bangura's office,  and the United Nations Population Fund and various  other partners.    In conclusion, my country is determined to continue  its efforts to completely eradicate sexual violence. We  highly value the support provided to us in that regard  by the United Nations and the international community."
