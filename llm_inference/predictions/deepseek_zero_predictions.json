    "UNSC_2004_SPV.5066Resumption1_spch026.txt": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this annotation task step by step. First, I need to read through the entire speech carefully to understand the context and identify the entities mentioned. The goal is to label each relevant entity as Hero, Villain, Victim, or a combination based on the speaker's portrayal.\n\nStarting with the beginning: \"Mr. Kau (Fiji):...\" The instruction says not to tag the speaker at the beginning, so I'll skip \"Mr. Kau (Fiji)\".\n\nNext, the speaker thanks \"Mr. President\" for organizing the debate. According to the guidelines, entities that are thanked or commended can be Heroes if they are taking active roles. Since Mr. President is being thanked for organizing, he's likely a Hero. So tag \"<HER>Mr. President</HER>\".\n\nThe Secretary-General is mentioned next. The report is timely, and the speaker commends him. The Secretary-General is an organization's leader and is being recognized for his work, so Hero. Tag \"<HER>the Secretary-General</HER>\".\n\nResolution 1325 (2000) is discussed. The guidelines say to tag UN Resolutions only if personified. Here, \"implementation of resolution 1325\" isn't personified, so no tag. But later, \"the full implementation of the resolution will continue to be a challenge...\" Still not personified. Wait, in the example, \"Resolution 1325 calls for action\" is tagged as Hero. Here, the resolution isn't personified, just being implemented. So no tag.\n\nFiji is mentioned as attaching importance to the subject. Countries are entities to tag. Fiji is commended for their efforts, so Hero. Tag \"<HER>Fiji</HER>\".\n\nThe Security Council, General Assembly, Economic and Social Council, etc., are commended. These are organizations contributing positively, so Heroes. The entire list is part of the same NP, so tag the whole: \"<HER>the Security Council, the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and its functional commissions and other United Nations bodies and entities</HER>\".\n\nUNIFEM and Commonwealth Secretariat are mentioned as active partners. These are organizations helping, so Heroes. Tag \"<HER>the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM)</HER>\" and \"<HER>the Commonwealth Secretariat</HER>\".\n\n\"Our Ministry for Women...\" is a possessive NP. The ministry is part of Fiji's efforts, so Hero. Tag \"<HER>Our Ministry for Women, Social Welfare and Poverty Alleviation</HER>\".\n\nLater, UNIFEM is mentioned again as a sponsor. Again, Hero. Tag \"<HER>UNIFEM</HER>\".\n\n\"civil society\" is a group contributing, so Hero. Tag \"<HER>civil society</HER>\".\n\n\"women\" in \"the best in our women\" are contributing positively, so Hero. Tag \"<HER>our women</HER>\".\n\n\"their contribution\" refers to women's, but \"contribution\" is an abstract concept, so not tagged. \n\n\"They have been effective stabilizers...\" refers to women again. Since they're active in peace-building, Hero. Tag \"<HER>They</HER>\".\n\n\"women and children\" in the peace process are playing key roles. Children might be Victims, but here they're active. Wait, the guidelines say Victims are those suffering or excluded. Since they're playing key roles, maybe not Victims. But the example had \"women and children\" as Victims in some contexts. Here, the speaker portrays them positively, so Hero. Tag \"<HER>women and children</HER>\".\n\n\"Fiji\" again in peacekeeping, Hero. Tag \"<HER>Fiji</HER>\".\n\n\"women's role in peacekeeping\" \u2013 \"women\" here are being empowered, so Hero. Tag \"<HER>women</HER>\".\n\n\"cultural and traditional barriers\" are abstract concepts, not entities. \n\n\"the military and police departments...\" are organizations working on strategies, Hero. Tag \"<HER>The military and police departments, together with other relevant bodies</HER>\".\n\n\"Fiji peacekeeping deployment to Iraq will include six women...\" The women are part of Hero efforts, so \"<HER>six women</HER>\".\n\n\"the Secretary-General\" again, Hero. Tag \"<HER>the Secretary-General</HER>\".\n\n\"Gender mainstreaming\" is abstract, not tagged.\n\n\"the Government\" of Fiji is a Hero. Tag \"<HER>The Government</HER>\".\n\n\"UNIFEM-sponsored Women and Peace and Security Committee\" \u2013 UNIFEM is already tagged, and the committee is a Hero. Tag \"<HER>the UNIFEM-sponsored Women and Peace and Security Committee</HER>\".\n\n\"developing countries\" are mentioned as having will but needing resources. They might be Victims, but the speaker is talking about their efforts. However, the guideline says Victims are those excluded or denied power. Here, developing countries lack resources, so maybe Victim. But the speaker commends their will, so maybe Hero. Hmm. The sentence says \"no lack of will... but enhanced cooperation... vital to ensure inflow of resources...\" This implies they need help, so Victim? Or Hero for their will? The guideline says Hero if they help victims or increase commitment. Since they're trying but need help, maybe Hero and Victim. But the speaker is from Fiji, a developing country, so portraying them as both? The exact phrase is \"no lack of will and enthusiasm at the national level, particularly in developing countries\". Since they're active but need resources, perhaps Hero. But the need for resources might make them Victim. Combined role? The guidelines allow combined roles if the entity fits multiple. So \"<HER_VIC>developing countries</HER_VIC>\".\n\n\"UNIFEM\" again, Hero. Tag \"<HER>UNIFEM</HER>\".\n\n\"regional organizations such as the Pacific Islands Forum and the Commonwealth Secretariat\" \u2013 Hero. Tag \"<HER>regional organizations such as the Pacific Islands Forum and the Commonwealth Secretariat</HER>\".\n\n\"indigenous women\" are recognized for their role in conflict resolution, so Hero. Tag \"<HER>indigenous women</HER>\".\n\n\"local women\" \u2013 Hero. Tag \"<HER>local women</HER>\".\n\n\"Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women\" and \"Beijing Declaration\" \u2013 these are laws/treaties, so not tagged.\n\n\"Fiji\" again, Hero. Tag \"<HER>Fiji</HER>\".\n\n\"women making up almost half\" \u2013 here, women are part of the population, not specifically acting, so not tagged. But later, \"women have played the prominent role...\" \u2013 Hero. Tag \"<HER>women</HER>\".\n\n\"the Security Council and the Secretary-General\" again, Heroes. Tag \"<HER>the Security Council and the Secretary-General</HER>\".\n\n\"women's participation\" \u2013 participation is an abstract concept, so not tagged, but \"women\" in \"women's participation\" might be Hero. Wait, the example says \"women\u2019s participation\" is an abstract concept, so \"women\" here would be part of the concept. But in the example, \"women\u2019s empowerment\" was tagged as HER_VIC. So maybe here, \"women's participation\" is a concept, so not tagged. Wait, the guidelines say in the example: \u201cwomen\u2019s participation\u201d is not tagged because it's a concept. So here, \"women's participation\" is a concept, so \"women\" is part of the concept and not tagged separately.\n\nNow, checking for Villains. Are there any entities causing harm? The speech is about positive efforts, so maybe no Villains. The only possible mention is \"cultural and traditional barriers\" but those are abstract. No Villains tagged.\n\nVictims: Are there any entities suffering? The \"developing countries\" needing resources might be Victims. Also, \"women\" in some contexts. For example, when talking about overcoming cultural barriers, but the women are being integrated, so more Hero. The \"indigenous women\" are Heroes. The only possible Victim is \"developing countries\" as needing help. But earlier, I considered them as HER_VIC. Let me check the guidelines again.\n\nVictim: suffers from injustice, excluded from decision-making. Developing countries needing resources could be seen as excluded, but the speaker is highlighting their efforts. Maybe not Victims. Alternatively, maybe the women in some parts are both Heroes and Victims. For example, when the speaker mentions overcoming cultural barriers, the women might be Victims of those barriers. But the sentence says \"Despite the difficulties... recent deployments have seen successful integration\". So the women are overcoming, which is Heroic. The barriers are abstract, not entities. So maybe no Victims except in combined roles where necessary.\n\nWait, in the example given, \"women\u2019s empowerment\" was tagged as HER_VIC because they need empowerment (Victim) but also contribute (Hero). In this speech, when the speaker talks about \"women's role in peacekeeping\" being expanded despite barriers, maybe \"women\" are both Hero and Victim. Similarly, \"women and children\" in the peace process \u2013 are they Victims? The example had \"women and children\" as Victims when part of a larger Villain entity. Here, they are active participants, so Heroes. \n\nAnother point: \"training and capacity-building must target not only girls and women, but also boys and men\". Here, girls and women might be Victims needing training, but the context is about empowering them, so Hero. Maybe not Victims here.\n\nThe only possible combined role is \"developing countries\" as HER_VIC, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe \"women\" in some parts are HER_VIC. For example, when the speaker says \"harness all the resources... women have played the prominent role we expected\", that's Hero. But earlier, \"cultural and traditional barriers\" might imply they were excluded, making them Victims. So in \"the expansion of women's role in peacekeeping\", women are Heroes, but the barriers suggest they were Victims. So maybe \"<HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>\" in that context.\n\nBut the guidelines say to tag based on how the speaker portrays them. The speaker is highlighting their successful integration despite barriers, so more Heroic. The barriers are the problem, but they're abstract. So women are Heroes here.\n\nTherefore, the main tags are Heroes for the organizations, countries, and groups mentioned positively. No clear Villains. Maybe some combined roles, but based on the examples, if the entity is both contributing and needing help, use combined tags. However, in this speech, the focus is on the positive roles, so most entities are Heroes. \n\nDouble-checking each mention:\n\n- \"women and children playing key roles\" \u2013 Hero.\n- \"indigenous women in conflict resolution as mediators\" \u2013 Hero.\n- \"local women have a strong advocacy role\" \u2013 Hero.\n- \"developing countries\" \u2013 maybe Hero, as they have will but need help. The need for resources might make them Victims, but the speaker is commending their efforts. It's a bit ambiguous. The guideline says Victim if they are excluded or denied power. Since they need resources, maybe Victim, but the speaker is from a developing country and portrays them as active. Maybe Hero.\n\nIn conclusion, most entities are Heroes. The output should have all the identified entities tagged as Hero, with possible combined roles where applicable. But based on the speech, I don't see clear instances where an entity is both Hero and Victim unless implied. The example given had \"women\u2019s empowerment\" as HER_VIC, so similar instances here might require that. For example, \"the expansion of women's role in peacekeeping\" \u2013 \"women\" here might be both Hero (for expanding roles) and Victim (needing empowerment). So tag \"<HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>\".\n\nBut the guidelines say to avoid tagging abstract concepts. \"women's role\" is a concept, but \"women\" as the entity. In the example, \"women\u2019s empowerment\" was tagged as HER_VIC because \"women\" are both needing empowerment (Victim) and contributing (Hero). So here, \"women's role\" \u2013 the entity is \"women\", so tag \"<HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>\".\n\nSimilarly, \"training and capacity-building must target not only girls and women...\" \u2013 \"girls and women\" might be Victims needing training but also Heroes as targets for empowerment. So \"<HER_VIC>girls and women</HER_VIC>\".\n\nBut the example in the guidelines says not to tag predicate nominatives. In the sentence \"Women are not only victims\", \"victims\" is a predicate nominative and not tagged. Here, \"girls and women\" are the direct objects of \"target\", so they are entities being targeted for capacity-building. Since they need training, they might be Victims, but the training is to empower them as Heroes. So combined HER_VIC.\n\nThis is getting complicated. The key is to follow the guidelines strictly. If the entity is portrayed as both helping (Hero) and needing protection (Victim), then combined. Otherwise, if they're only one, tag accordingly.\n\nIn the speech, most mentions of women are in the context of their positive contributions, so Hero. The need for training or overcoming barriers might imply Victim status, but the speaker focuses on their active roles. Therefore, maybe just Hero.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to tag all the identified entities as Heroes unless there's a clear indication of Victim status. The developing countries part is tricky, but since the speaker commends their will, maybe just Hero.\n\nNow, applying the tags as per the analysis, ensuring correct nesting and no punctuation inside tags. Also, maintaining original spacing and spelling, including the double spaces after periods.\n</think>\n\nMr. Kau (Fiji): We would like to thank you,  <HER>Mr. President</HER>, for having organized today's debate on  this issue. We also congratulate <HER>the Secretary-General</HER>  for his timely report on the follow-up to the full  implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) on women  and peace and security (S/2004/814).    While <HER>the Secretary-General's</HER> report shows that  there have been positive developments in the  implementation of the resolution, further concerted  efforts are needed to ensure that the issue of  implementation is fully addressed. The full  implementation of the resolution will continue to be a  challenge for <HER>the Security Council</HER> and for <HER>the United  Nations</HER>.  <HER>Fiji</HER> attaches great importance to this subject, and  we commend the efforts made thus far by <HER>the Security  Council, the General Assembly, the Economic and  Social Council and its functional commissions and  other United Nations bodies and entities</HER>. We  commend, in particular, the efforts made by <HER>the United  Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM)</HER> and  by <HER>regional organizations and other bodies, including  the Commonwealth Secretariat</HER>, which have been active  partners in following up this issue in Fiji. <HER>Our Ministry  for Women, Social Welfare and Poverty Alleviation</HER> has  been the focal point of efforts to mainstream gender  perspectives in relation to critical peace and security  components in Government and other areas.    The necessary groundwork for the launching in  Fiji of national policies and strategies pursuant to  resolution 1325 (2000) has been greatly boosted by the  sponsorship and support of <HER>UNIFEM</HER>. and other actors,  including <HER>civil society</HER>. Work on mainstreaming gender  perspectives in relation to conflict prevention,  peacekeeping operations, humanitarian assistance and  post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation is in  progress.    Recent political and internal upheavals in our  country have brought out the best in <HER>our women</HER>, and  their contribution has been a strong factor for good and  steady progress. <HER>They</HER> have been effective stabilizers  and mediators in conflict prevention and very active  players in recent efforts in post-conflict peace-building  and reconciliation processes. A week-long peace and  reconciliation process with the objective, inter alia, of  uniting our polarized and divided country, which was  held last month, saw <HER>women and children</HER> playing key  roles. This was preceded by a national workshop on  conflict prevention and early warning.    In peacekeeping, <HER>Fiji</HER>, which is a staunch  supporter of and consistent contributor to international  peacekeeping missions, has introduced specific  measures to ensure the expansion of <HER>women</HER>'s role in  peacekeeping. Despite the difficulties in overcoming  cultural and traditional barriers, recent deployments  have seen the successful integration of <HER>women</HER> into  various specialized duties, including guard duty. <HER>The  military and police departments, together with other  relevant bodies</HER>, are working on coherent strategies for  gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping. <HER>The Fiji  peacekeeping deployment to Iraq</HER> will include six  women who have been given specific training in  searching and in counselling. That also illustrates our  view that <HER>women</HER> can be as good as men in all areas if  given the opportunity.  We fully agree with <HER>the Secretary-General</HER> that  more effort must be put into capacity-building and  training. Gender mainstreaming in relation to all facets  of peace and security requires knowledge and  information-sharing. Training and capacity-building  must target not only <HER>girls and women</HER>, but also <HER>boys  and men</HER> at all levels of government and the  community. It should be all-encompassing and  comprehensive, targeting both the formal and the non-  formal sectors. Its inclusion in the education  curriculum will ensure early intervention and sustained  impact. <HER>The Government</HER>, through the programmes of  its Ministry for Women and through <HER>the UNIFEM-  sponsored Women and Peace and Security Committee</HER>,  is addressing the issue with all relevant stakeholders.    In addition, there is a need for more effective  coordination and partnerships. There is certainly no  lack of will and enthusiasm at the national level,  particularly in developing countries, but enhanced  cooperation and partnership are vital to ensure the  inflow of the resources and expertise which are  generally lacking in our countries. We therefore  welcome the call by <HER>the Secretary-General</HER> for the  development and strengthening of cooperation and  effective partnerships at all levels. We acknowledge the  good work done by <HER>UNIFEM</HER>. and other <HER>United Nations  bodies</HER>, together with <HER>regional organizations such as the  Pacific Islands Forum and the Commonwealth  Secretariat</HER>, in the Pacific region, including in Fiji. We  can only hope for more such cooperation and  partnerships.    We also commend <HER>the Secretary-General</HER> for his  recognition of the role of <HER>indigenous women</HER> in conflict  resolution as mediators and peace-builders. <HER>Indigenous  and local women</HER> have a strong advocacy role, and it  should be utilized in all aspects of security and peace.    There is a need to ensure that national and  international efforts for the implementation of  resolution 1325 (2000) are undertaken in a  comprehensive manner in the context of the  Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of  Discrimination against Women and the Beijing  Declaration and Platform for Action. To ensure  complementarity",
    "UNSC_2009_SPV.6195_spch008.txt": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this annotation task step by step. First, I need to read through the entire speech carefully to identify all the entities that fit the Hero, Villain, or Victim roles based on the guidelines provided.\n\nStarting with the first paragraph: The speaker thanks Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. According to the guidelines, the Secretary-General is an organization/position, but since he's being thanked for his role and the speech mentions his contributions, he should be labeled as a Hero. Similarly, the ministers from Burkina Faso and France are mentioned as being welcomed, but unless they are actively doing something heroic, I need to check. The speaker acknowledges Madam Secretary of State's leadership and commitment, which fits the Hero role. The delegation of the United States is thanked for leading negotiations on resolution 1888, so that's a Hero role. The resolution itself is mentioned as being adopted, and since it's a UN resolution that's personified (they talk about its role in reaffirming commitment), so resolution 1888 should be a Hero.\n\nNext, the Security Council is mentioned as reaffirming commitment to protect women in armed conflict. The Security Council as an organization acting to protect victims would be Hero. The international community is resolved to protect women and children as victims, so \"women and children\" are Victims here. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is mentioned in the context of witnessing crimes, so they might be Victims, but the country itself isn't the victim; rather, the women and children there are. The parties to armed conflict are obligated to protect women and children, so those parties could be Villains if they're the ones causing harm, but the text says they have an obligation, so maybe they're not directly labeled here unless they're failing. The post of Special Representative is established, which is a Hero because it's a role aimed at addressing sexual violence.\n\nIn the next paragraphs, the multidisciplinary team of experts is mentioned as working to strengthen the rule of law, so they're Heroes. The perpetrators of crimes are Villains, but they're referred to indirectly (\"bringing perpetrators to justice\"), so \"perpetrators\" would be Villains. The victims' needs are addressed, so \"victims\" here are Victims. The challenge is ensuring women and children don't fall victim, so \"women and children\" again as Victims.\n\nNow, applying the tags:\n\n- \"Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\" is a Hero.\n- \"Mr. Bedouma Alain Yoda, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Burkina Faso\" and \"Mr. Alain Joyandet, Minister of State for Cooperation and Francophonie of France\" are welcomed but not active, so maybe not tagged unless their roles are heroic. The speaker thanks the US delegation for leading negotiations, so \"delegation of the United States\" is Hero.\n- \"resolution 1888 (2009)\" is a Hero as a personified UN resolution.\n- \"Security Council\" as Hero.\n- \"international community\" as Hero.\n- \"women and children\" as Victims.\n- \"Democratic Republic of the Congo\" mentioned in the context of witnessing crimes, but the victims are the women and children there, so maybe not tagged unless the country is a Victim, which it's not directly.\n- \"parties to an armed conflict\" might be Villains if they're the ones causing harm, but the text says they have obligations, so maybe not directly labeled unless they're failing. The resolution says they must respect laws, implying they might be Villains if they don't, but the text doesn't explicitly state their villainy here.\n- \"Special Representative of the Secretary-General on sexual violence...\" is a Hero.\n- \"multidisciplinary team of experts\" as Hero.\n- \"perpetrators\" as Villains.\n- \"victims\" as Victims.\n- \"women and children\" again as Victims.\n\nNeed to check for combined roles. For example, women are mentioned both as needing protection (Victim) but also as agents in other contexts. However, in this speech, women are mainly referred to as victims. The resolution is a Hero. The international community as Hero. The Security Council as Hero. The experts team as Hero. The perpetrators as Villains. The victims as Victims.\n\nAlso, check for possessive modifiers: \"my delegation\" should be tagged as Hero. \"Madam Secretary of State\" as Hero. \"United Nations mechanisms and agencies\" as Hero. \"General Assembly\" as an organization, but unless they're acting heroically here, maybe not. The composite gender entity under negotiation is an abstract concept, so not tagged. \"States that are addressing situations of conflict\" might be Heroes if they're improving capacities. \"national capacities\" is abstract, not tagged. \"rule of law\" is abstract. \"impunity\" is abstract. \"spiral of violence\" is abstract.\n\nSo applying the tags accordingly, making sure to include entire noun phrases and possessive modifiers. For example, \"my delegation\" as Hero. \"women and children\" as Victims each time they're mentioned in the context of being victims. \"perpetrators of such crimes\" as Villains. \"multidisciplinary team of experts\" as Hero. \"Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\" as Hero. \"Madam Secretary of State\" as Hero. \"delegation of the United States\" as Hero. \"resolution 1888 (2009)\" as Hero. \"Security Council\" as Hero. \"international community\" as Hero. \"Special Representative of the Secretary-General...\" as Hero. \"United Nations mechanisms and agencies\" as Hero. \"States that are addressing situations of conflict\" as Hero if they're improving capacities. \"Government\" as Hero when working with the UN. \"United Nations system\" as Hero.\n\nAlso, check for combined roles. For example, women might be both Victim and Hero if they're portrayed as both needing protection and contributing, but in this speech, they're mainly Victims. Similarly, the perpetrators are Villains. The resolution is a Hero. The international community as Hero. The Security Council as Hero.\n\nNow, structure the output with the exact same spacing and punctuation. Make sure not to include any trailing punctuation in the tags. For example, \"women and children</VIC>\" followed by a period outside the tag.\n\nDouble-check for any missed entities and ensure that all applicable tags are correctly applied based on the guidelines without relying on external knowledge. Only tag entities as per the speaker's portrayal.\n</think>\n\n<HER>Mr. Heller (Mexico)</HER> (spoke in Spanish): I would  like to thank <HER>Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</HER> for    joining us at this important meeting of the <HER>Security  Council</HER>. We would also like to welcome to the <HER>Council  Chamber</HER> <HER>Mr. Bedouma Alain Yoda, Minister for  Foreign Affairs of Burkina Faso</HER>, and <HER>Mr. Alain  Joyandet, Minister of State for Cooperation and  Francophonie of France</HER>.    I would like in particular to welcome you,  <HER>Madam Secretary of State</HER>, and to acknowledge your  personal commitment and leadership, which have  created renewed impetus for the issue of the protection  of <VIC>women's rights</VIC> and the prevention of all forms of  violence against <VIC>women</VIC>. <HER>My delegation</HER> would also  like to thank <HER>the delegation of the United States</HER> for  leading negotiations on <HER>resolution 1888 (2009)</HER>, which  has just been adopted.    With the unanimous adoption of that resolution,  the <HER>Security Council</HER> has reaffirmed its commitment to  the protection of <VIC>women</VIC> in armed conflict. The  significant number of delegations that joined in  sponsoring this initiative shows that the <HER>international  community</HER> is resolved to ensure that <VIC>women</VIC> and  <VIC>children</VIC> no longer remain the principal victims of the  armed conflicts which, deplorably, are occurring in  many parts of the world.    <HER>Council members</HER> were able to see for ourselves  the gravity of the acts of sexual violence against  <VIC>women</VIC> and <VIC>children</VIC> in areas of armed conflict in the  course of our visit to a number of African countries last  May, in particular the <VIC>Democratic Republic of the  Congo</VIC>. On that occasion we witnessed the  consequences of these crimes for societies and their  negative impact on efforts to find solutions to crisis  situations and promote an effective process of national  reconciliation. For that reason we wish to reiterate, as  does <HER>resolution 1888 (2009)</HER>, the primary obligation of  all parties to an armed conflict to respect and to  enforce at all times international humanitarian law,  which grants special protection to <VIC>women</VIC> and <VIC>children</VIC>.    <HER>My delegation</HER> believes that the establishment of  the post of <HER>Special Representative of the Secretary-  General on sexual violence in situations of armed  conflict</HER> will make it possible to improve the systematic  and comprehensive attention that the <HER>United Nations</HER>  pays in response to sexual violence in these situations.    This new mandate should work in a coordinated  manner with other <HER>United Nations mechanisms</HER> and  <HER>agencies</HER> in order to harness synergies and to prevent  duplication. In particular, there is a broad relationship    between the objectives of <HER>resolution 1888 (2009)</HER> and  <HER>resolution 1882 (2009)</HER>, on <VIC>children</VIC> and armed conflict,  which was adopted by the <HER>Security Council</HER> last  August.    These common objectives must be duly explored  with a view to providing comprehensive protection for  all those who, due to their condition, suffer most from  the consequences of armed conflict, that is, <VIC>women</VIC> and  <VIC>children</VIC>. In the light of the aforementioned, we believe  that the <HER>Security Council</HER> must also pay close attention  to the ongoing negotiations on a composite gender  entity within the framework of the <HER>General Assembly</HER>  and decide to review the mandate of the <HER>Special  Representative</HER> in a reasonable period of time and in  the light of the results of the procedure outlined in  <HER>General Assembly resolution 63/311</HER>.    While more can be done at the international level  in order to prevent sexual violence in situations of  armed conflict, the eradication of sexual violence will  only be achieved if national capacities among those  <HER>States</HER> that are addressing situations of conflict are  improved with a view to bringing the <VIL>perpetrators</VIL> of  such crimes to justice.    Therefore, one of the most relevant aspects of the  resolution is the identification within the <HER>United  Nations</HER> of a <HER>multidisciplinary team of experts</HER> who,  when their assistance is required and with the consent  of the <HER>State</HER> concerned, can be deployed to the field in  order to work jointly with the <HER>Government</HER> and the  <HER>United Nations system</HER> to undertake projects for  technical cooperation to strengthen the rule of law,  prevent impunity and address <VIC>victims'</VIC> needs.    It is clear that currently we have strong tools for  preventing sexual violence in areas of conflict. The  true challenge that we face is making full use of this  array of instruments, if we truly wish to ensure that  more <VIC>women</VIC> and <VIC>children</VIC> do not fall victim to the  spiral of violence that is caused by armed conflict.",
    "UNSC_2011_SPV.6642_spch055.txt": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding the task. I need to annotate the given UN Security Council speech with Hero, Villain, or Victim tags based on the guidelines provided. The key is to identify entities (people, organizations, countries, groups, UN resolutions if personified) and determine their roles as per the speaker's portrayal.\n\nFirst, I'll go through the speech paragraph by paragraph. The speaker is from Senegal, addressing a debate on women, peace, and security. The initial part has thanks to various officials. According to guideline 4d, speakers at the beginning separated by a colon shouldn't be tagged. So \"Mr. Diallo (Senegal)\" and others mentioned in the opening are not tagged.\n\nLooking at the first paragraph after the colon: \"I would like to convey my delegation's sincere congratulations...\" The phrase \"my delegation\" is a possessive NP. Guideline 1c says to include possessive modifiers, so \"<HER>my delegation</HER>\". \n\nNext, he thanks several people: the Secretary-General, Mr. Lazarous Kapambwe, Ms. Michelle Bachelet, Ms. Orzala Ashraf Nemat. These are all individuals contributing to the cause. Since they're part of the same NP and share a role (being thanked for contributions), the entire list is a Hero. So \"<HER>the Secretary-General... civil society</HER>\".\n\nMoving on, \"resolution 1325 (2000)\" is mentioned as a step forward. UN resolutions are tagged if personified. The text says it \"represented an enormous step...\", which is personification. So \"<HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>\". Later mentions of resolutions 1820, etc., are part of the same NP and share the Hero role, so the entire list is tagged as Hero.\n\nThe next paragraph talks about \"persistent shortcomings\" exposing \"thousands of women and girls\" to abuse. \"Women and girls\" are victims here, so \"<VIC>thousands of women and girls</VIC>\". \n\nRape as a weapon of war: the perpetrators (villains) aren't explicitly mentioned, but the victims are \"women\" again. However, the sentence structure doesn't name the villains, so focus on victims. \"sexual and gender-based violence\" is an abstract concept, so not tagged. \"vulnerable group\" refers to women, so \"<VIC>that vulnerable group of the population</VIC>\".\n\nThe international community is called to combat impunity. \"international community\" is a Hero as they're taking action. So \"<HER>the international community</HER>\".\n\nNext, \"zero tolerance policy on sexual violence of the Secretary-General\" \u2013 the Secretary-General is a Hero. \"<HER>the Secretary-General</HER>\". \n\nLow participation of women in strategies: \"women\" here are excluded from decision-making, making them Victims. \"<VIC>the continuing low participation of women</VIC>\". \n\nLater, \"foster women's participation\" \u2013 here, women are being empowered, so Hero. \"<HER>women's participation</HER>\". Also, \"women's empowerment\" is both Hero (active role) and Victim (needing empowerment), so combined tag \"<HER_VIC>women's empowerment</HER_VIC>\".\n\nSenegal's actions: \"my country\" is Hero. \"<HER>my country</HER>\". \"national gender-parity monitoring body\" is an organization taking action, Hero. \"<HER>a national gender-parity monitoring body</HER>\".\n\n\"Senegal has already adopted... resolution 1325 (2000)\" \u2013 resolution 1325 again as Hero. \"<HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>\". \n\nECOWAS and Dakar Declaration: organizations contributing positively, Hero. \"<HER>the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)</HER>\" and \"<HER>the Dakar Declaration</HER>\".\n\n\"UN-Women and all of the other relevant bodies\" \u2013 Hero organizations. \"<HER>UN-Women</HER>\" and \"<HER>all of the other relevant bodies</HER>\".\n\nAppeal against illicit trade in arms: the illicit trade is a Villain causing harm. But the entities here are the \"illicit trade in small arms and light weapons\" \u2013 abstract concept? Wait, guideline 4a says not to tag abstract concepts. But \"illicit trade\" is a group causing harm. Hmm, maybe not. The appeal is to combat it, so the trade itself is a Villain. But according to the guidelines, groups are taggable. So \"<VIL>the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons</VIL>\".\n\n\"diplomatic conference of 2012\" \u2013 an event, not an entity. Not tagged. \n\nFinally, \"Security Council\" is an organization being called to action, Hero. \"<HER>the Security Council</HER>\". \"resolution 1325 (2000)\" again as Hero. \"<HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>\".\n\nI need to ensure that all tags are correctly applied without overlapping unless necessary. Also, check for combined roles. For example, \"women's empowerment\" is both Hero and Victim. \n\nWait, in the example given, \"women\u2019s empowerment\" is tagged as HER_VIC because they need empowerment (Victim) but contribute as Heroes. Here, the speaker says \"special focus on women's empowerment, which will require significant investment...\" So empowerment here is about enabling women, thus they are both victims needing help and heroes in their role. So combined tag.\n\nAlso, check for possessive cases like \"women's participation\" \u2013 guideline 4a says not to tag abstract concepts, but \"women\" is the entity. So \"women's participation\" \u2013 \"participation\" is abstract, but \"women's\" is possessive. The example says in \"women\u2019s participation\", women are the entity taking action, so tag \"women\u2019s\" as HER. But in another example, if it's \"women's empowerment\", and empowerment is both helping them (Victim) and them being Heroes, then combined. So here, \"women's participation\" is tagged as HER because they are agents, but in another part, \"women's empowerment\" is HER_VIC.\n\nAnother point: when the speaker mentions \"the effective participation of women in decision-making processes\", \"women\" here are being included, so Victim (excluded before, now being included). But also, their participation makes them Heroes. So combined HER_VIC? Or based on the context. The sentence says \"ensure the effective participation of women in decision-making processes.\" The women are being given a role, so they were excluded (Victim) and now participating (Hero). So \"<HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>\".\n\nBut need to check the exact wording. The guideline says to tag based on portrayal. If the speaker is highlighting their role as participants, it's Hero. If they were previously excluded, that's Victim. But in the current sentence, it's about ensuring their participation, which is empowering, so maybe Hero. However, the prior sentence mentions the law to establish parity, implying they were excluded (Victim). So in the sentence \"Senegal intends to ensure the effective participation of women...\", \"women\" are both previously victims and now heroes. But the current mention is about their participation, which is Heroic. So maybe just HER. But according to the example, when empowerment is both, it's combined. Hmm.\n\nThis is tricky. The guidelines say to combine roles if the entity is portrayed in multiple roles. Here, the women are being given a role (Hero) but were previously victims. However, in the current sentence, the focus is on their participation as a positive role, so maybe just HER. But the overall context might imply they're still victims needing empowerment. I think in the sentence about empowerment, it's HER_VIC, but in the participation sentence, it's HER. Need to be context-specific.\n\nAlso, \"vulnerable group\" is tagged as VIC. \"vulnerable group of the population\" refers to women, so \"<VIC>that vulnerable group of the population</VIC>\".\n\nAnother part: \"the poor results in that area have undoubtedly been due to the continuing low participation of women...\" Here, \"women\" have low participation, so they're excluded (Victim). So \"<VIC>the continuing low participation of women</VIC>\".\n\nIn the part where he says \"foster women's participation by reserving a key role for them...\", \"women's participation\" is the NP. The possessive \"women's\" is part of the NP. Since participation is an abstract concept, but \"women's\" is the entity. Since they are being given a key role, it's Heroic. So \"<HER>women's participation</HER>\".\n\nWait, but guideline 4a says not to tag abstract concepts, but \"participation\" is abstract. However, the example given in guidelines shows \"women\u2019s participation\" where \"women\u2019s\" is tagged as HER. So in that case, \"women's participation\" would have \"women's\" tagged as HER, but \"participation\" is not. But the guidelines say to include the entire NP. Wait, the example says: \u201c<HER>women</HER> as agents of peace\u201d \u2013 here, \"women\" is tagged, not the entire phrase. But in another example, \u201c<HER>parties that perpetuate acts of violence against women and children</HER>\u201d \u2013 the entire NP including the relative clause.\n\nSo for \"women's participation\", the NP is \"women's participation\", but \"participation\" is an abstract concept. However, guideline 1c says to include possessive modifiers. So \"women's participation\" is a NP with possessive, so the entire phrase is tagged. But according to guideline 4a, if it's an abstract concept like \"participation\", do we tag it? The example in guidelines shows that \"women's participation\" is tagged as HER because the entity is women, and the participation is their action. But guideline 4a says not to tag abstract concepts, but women are the entity. So perhaps \"women's participation\" is tagged as HER because the women are the heroes, and their participation is their role. So \"<HER>women's participation</HER>\".\n\nSimilarly, \"women's empowerment\" is \"<HER_VIC>women's empowerment</HER_VIC>\" because empowerment implies they are victims needing help but also heroes in contributing.\n\nAnother point: \"the Dakar Declaration by focusing on the four following areas...\" \u2013 the Declaration is an organization/entity, so Hero.\n\nAlso, \"UN-Women\" is an organization, so Hero. Similarly, \"ECOWAS\" is an organization, Hero.\n\nIn the part about the arms trade treaty, \"illicit trade in small arms and light weapons\" is a group causing harm, so Villain. So \"<VIL>the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons</VIL>\".\n\nThe \"diplomatic conference of 2012\" is an event, not an entity, so not tagged.\n\nFinally, \"the Security Council\" is an organization being called to action, Hero. \"<HER>the Security Council</HER>\".\n\nI need to make sure that all tags are correctly applied, including nested tags where necessary. Also, check for combined roles when applicable. For example, when women are both victims and heroes in the same mention.\n\nAnother example: \"the effective prevention of all forms of violence against women\" \u2013 \"women\" here are victims of violence. So \"<VIC>women</VIC>\".\n\nIn the sentence \"rape continues to be used as a weapon of war...\", the perpetrators are not mentioned, so only the victims \"women\" are tagged, but the sentence structure doesn't name the villains. So \"rape\" is an abstract concept, not tagged. The victims are \"women\" but the phrase is \"women and girls\" earlier.\n\nWait, in the sentence \"persistent shortcomings have exposed thousands of women and girls to various types of barbaric abuse and atrocities.\" Here, \"thousands of women and girls\" are victims. So \"<VIC>thousands of women and girls</VIC>\".\n\nIn \"sexual and gender-based violence, even at the end of a conflict, represents an almost permanent threat to the security and health of that vulnerable group of the population.\" \"that vulnerable group\" refers to women, so \"<VIC>that vulnerable group of the population</VIC>\".\n\nIn \"vigorously combating impunity\", the villains are those causing impunity, but they aren't named. So no tag here.\n\nWhen he says \"I would like to launch an appeal for coordinated and focused action against the illicit trade...\", the trade is the villain. So \"<VIL>the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons</VIL>\".\n\nAlso, \"Senegal has already adopted its national action plan...\" \u2013 \"Senegal\" is a country taking action, Hero. \"<HER>Senegal</HER>\".\n\nWait, earlier mentions of \"my country\" refer to Senegal, so \"<HER>my country</HER>\".\n\nIn the part about the national action plan for resolution 1325, \"resolution 1325 (2000)\" is again personified, so Hero.\n\nThe \"Dakar Declaration\" is an entity, Hero.\n\n\"UN-Women\" is an organization, Hero.\n\n\"all of the other relevant bodies\" \u2013 Hero.\n\n\"peacekeeping operations\" \u2013 abstract, not tagged.\n\n\"the Security Council\" \u2013 Hero.\n\nNow, applying all these tags step by step, ensuring that the original spacing and punctuation are preserved. Also, make sure not to tag the speaker's own delegation or country unless they are portrayed as heroes, which they are in this case because they are taking positive actions.\n\nAnother check: \"the establishment of the post of the Special Representative...\" \u2013 guideline 1g says not to tag positions mentioned in the abstract. So even if the Special Representative is a person, if it's just the post being mentioned, not tagged. But in this speech, the Special Representative isn't mentioned, so no issue.\n\nAlso, \"Ms. Michelle Bachelet, Executive Director of UN-Women\" \u2013 \"UN-Women\" is an organization, so \"<HER>UN-Women</HER>\".\n\nIn the list of thanked individuals, \"Mr. Lazarous Kapambwe, President of the Economic and Social Council, Ms. Michelle Bachelet... civil society\" \u2013 all these are part of the same NP, so tagged as Hero.\n\nNow, let's reconstruct the speech with the tags:\n\nStarting with the speaker line, which isn't tagged. Then:\n\n\"I would  like to convey <HER>my delegation</HER>'s sincere congratulations  for the convening of this important debate on women,  peace and security, which represents, Madam  President, the crowning moment of your remarkable  presidency of the Council for the month of October. I  would like to thank <HER>the Secretary-General</HER> for his  statement, as well as <HER>Mr. Lazarous Kapambwe,  President of the Economic and Social Council,  Ms. Michelle Bachelet, Executive Director of  UN-Women, and Ms. Orzala Ashraf Nemat,  representative of civil society</HER> for their important  contributions.\"\n\nNext paragraph:\n\n\"My delegation has a special interest in the topic,  because <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> represented an  enormous step forward in the protection of <VIC>women</VIC> and  highlighted the importance of their role in all aspects  of United Nations peacekeeping. Nonetheless, while it  has remained far from being a cure-all, <HER>resolution 1325  (2000)</HER> has contributed, along with <HER>resolutions 1820  (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1889 (2009)</HER>, to improving the  normative framework for preventing gender-based  violence and for protecting <VIC>women</VIC> against that  scourge.\"\n\nNext:\n\n\"It should, however, be pointed out that, despite  those praiseworthy efforts, persistent shortcomings  have exposed <VIC>thousands of women and girls</VIC> to various  types of barbaric abuse and atrocities. In fact, rape  continues to be used as a weapon of war in certain  conflict areas, and the ongoing existence of sexual and  gender-based violence, even at the end of a conflict,  represents an almost permanent threat to the security  and health of <VIC>that vulnerable group of the population</VIC>.  That is why <HER>the international community</HER> must firmly  commit to vigorously combating impunity in order to  guarantee the effective prevention of all forms of  violence against <VIC>women</VIC>.\"\n\nNext paragraph:\n\n\"While welcoming the zero tolerance policy on  sexual violence of <HER>the Secretary-General</HER>, we must, in  addition, insist on the need to bolster the role of  women in conflict-prevention and resolution.  Nevertheless, the poor results in that area have  undoubtedly been due to <VIC>the continuing low  participation of women</VIC> in the drafting of  implementation strategies. I consider it crucial,  therefore, to foster <HER>women's participation</HER> by reserving  a key role for them in conflict-prevention policies, as  well as policies on peacekeeping, peacebuilding and  social and economic recovery. In that context, there  must be a special focus on <HER_VIC>women's empowerment</HER_VIC>,  which will require significant investment in education,  training and maternal health.\"\n\nNext:\n\n\"In View of our considerable awareness of that  dynamic process, <HER>my country</HER> has allocated a  significant part of its budget to education and health,  and on 14 May 2010, it adopted a law to establish full  parity in all partially or fully elected bodies. In that  manner, Senegal intends to ensure the effective  participation of <HER>women</HER> in decision-making processes.  To follow up on that law, <HER>a national gender-parity  monitoring body</HER> was set up and will be officially  inaugurated on 16 November.\"\n\nNext:\n\n\"<HER>Senegal</HER> has already adopted its national action  plan to implement <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>.  Furthermore, it has sought to make a positive  contribution to drafting the action plan of <HER>the  Economic Community of West African States  (ECOWAS)</HER> and <HER>the Dakar Declaration</HER> by focusing on  the four following areas: first, effective participation of  women in the peace process; secondly, protection of  women and girls; thirdly, prevention of gender-based  violence through preventive diplomacy and early  warning systems, and fourthly, reconstruction and  victim assistance.\"\n\nNext paragraph:\n\n\"It is certain that those significant national and  regional level initiatives are welcome. However, they  will achieve the desired success only if linked with an  international dynamic inspired by <HER>the Security Council</HER>  and based on coordinated efforts on the part of  <HER>UN-Women</HER> and <HER>all of the other relevant bodies</HER>. There  is also a need to improve women's involvement in  peacekeeping operations by following up on the  laudable efforts already carried out in that domain.\"\n\nNext:\n\n\"The effective prevention of sexual violence also",
    "UNSC_2013_SPV.7044_spch013.txt": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this annotation task step by step. First, I need to read through the entire speech carefully to identify all the entities that fit the criteria for Hero, Villain, or Victim roles based on the guidelines provided.\n\nStarting with the beginning, the speaker addresses \"Mr. Laassel (Morocco)\" but according to guideline 4d, speakers at the beginning separated by a colon shouldn't be tagged. So I'll skip that part.\n\nNext, the speaker thanks several individuals: Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Ms. Navanethem Pillay, Ms. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, and Ms. Brigitte Balipou. These are people and organizations (like UN Women) that are being recognized for their contributions. According to the Hero definition (2a), entities that help victims, increase commitment to a cause, or recognize injustice should be tagged as Heroes. So each of these individuals and their titles should be wrapped in <HER> tags. For example, \"<HER>Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</HER>\", \"<HER>Ms. Navanethem Pillay, High Commissioner for Human Rights</HER>\", etc. Also, \"UN Women\" is an organization contributing positively, so it's a Hero.\n\nMoving on, the report of the Secretary-General on women, peace, and security (S/2013/525) and resolution 2122 (2013) are mentioned. UN Resolutions should only be tagged if personified. The report is mentioned in the context of taking stock of actions, so maybe not personified. However, resolution 2122 is part of the actions taken, but the example says resolutions are tagged only when personified. The phrase \"adoption of resolution 2122 (2013)\" doesn't personify it, so no tag here. Later, when discussing resolution 1325 (2000) in \"implementation of resolution 1325 (2000)\", again, not personified. But in the example given, \"Resolution 1325 calls for action\" would be tagged. Here, it's just being implemented, so no tag.\n\nThe Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict is mentioned as assisting States. This team is acting to help, so Hero. Similarly, the Standing Committee on Women, Peace and Security is creating a strategic framework, which is a Hero role.\n\nWhen the speech mentions \"women's participation in decision-making\", \"women's participation\" is an abstract concept (participation) so according to 4a, not tagged. But \"women\" themselves might be victims or heroes. In \"strengthening women's participation\", \"women's\" is possessive. The example says \"women\u2019s participation\" would have \"women\u2019s\" as HER_VIC if they are both empowering (hero) and needing help (victim). Here, the context is about strengthening their participation in peacekeeping, which implies they are both contributing (Hero) and possibly marginalized (Victim). So \"<HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> participation\".\n\nLater, \"refugee or displaced women\" are suffering, so Victims. \"Refugee women who lack documents\" are also Victims. The 1951 Convention's States parties are being urged to comply, so they might be Villains if they're not complying, but the text says \"it is essential that Member States... comply\", which is a call to action. The States here are being asked to act, so maybe Heroes? But they're not actively doing something heroic yet. Since they're being called upon, maybe not tagged. The registration programmes are positive, so perhaps Hero, but the programmes themselves are abstract. The entities to tag are people, organizations, countries, groups, or UN resolutions. Programmes are abstract, so not tagged.\n\nThe Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) is mentioned as undertaking efforts in protection, so Hero. \"States\" have the responsibility to end consequences for women and children, so if States are failing, they might be Villains, but the text says \"the responsibility lies with States\" to end the tragic consequences. So States are being urged to act, but unless they're portrayed as causing harm, they're not Villains. Here, it's their responsibility, but not necessarily villainous. So maybe not tagged.\n\n\"Women and children\" suffering from armed conflict are Victims. \"Women in national... institutions\" are being empowered, so Heroes. But earlier, they're victims. So in different contexts, same entity might have different tags. For example, when talking about their suffering, they're Victims, but when participating in institutions, Heroes. Need to check each occurrence.\n\nLooking for combined roles. For example, \"local women's entities\" are a driving force in empowering women, so Hero. But women might also be Victims needing empowerment. So \"<HER_VIC>local women's</HER_VIC> entities\".\n\nThe Secretary-General's seven-point action plan is mentioned; since it's a plan, maybe not tagged unless personified. The plan itself isn't an entity, so no tag.\n\nIn the part about refugee women facing discrimination, \"refugee women\" are Victims. \"Gender-based discrimination\" is an abstract concept, so not tagged.\n\nNow, applying the tags step by step, ensuring correct nesting and combined roles where applicable. Also, checking for noun phrases and possessive modifiers. For example, \"my delegation\" is a possessive NP, so tagged as Hero if they're acting positively. The Moroccan delegation thanks others, which is a positive action, so \"<HER>my delegation</HER>\".\n\nEach tagged entity should be a full noun phrase, including modifiers. For example, \"the Secretary-General on women, peace and security (S/2013/525)\" is a report, but the Secretary-General is a person, so earlier mentions of Ban Ki-moon were tagged. The report itself isn't an entity to tag unless personified, which it isn't here.\n\nThe final output should have all the identified entities tagged correctly, maintaining original spacing and punctuation. Double-checking for any missed entities and ensuring that only the specified entities (people, organizations, countries, groups, UN resolutions when personified) are tagged.\n</think>\n\nMr. Laassel (Morocco) (spoke in French): Allow  me at the outset to convey to you, Sir, on behalf of the  <HER>Moroccan delegation</HER>, our gratitude for the convening  of this debate. I thank for their briefings <HER>Secretary-  General Ban Ki-moon</HER>; <HER>Ms. Navanethem Pillay, High  Commissioner for Human Rights</HER>; and <HER>Ms. Phumzile  Mlambo-Ngcuka, Executive Director of <HER>UN Women</HER></HER>.  I welcome <HER>Ms. Mlambo-Ngcuka's</HER> appointment and  assure her of our full cooperation and support as she  discharges her mission. We also thank <HER>Ms. Brigitte  Balipou, Chair of the <HER>NGO Working Group on Women,  Peace and Security</HER></HER>, for her constructive contribution.    <HER>My delegation</HER> welcomes the report of the Secretary-  General on women, peace and security (S/2013/525)  and the adoption of resolution 2122 (2013) on the issue.  The report takes stock of the actions and initiatives of  <HER>Member States</HER> in the framework of implementation  of the resolution, especially in strengthening <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC>  participation in decision-making, integrating gender-  specific issues in peacekeeping operations and  training staff who participate in those operations.  The report confirms that much work remains, despite  the significant progress of <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> participation in  peacekeeping operations and their representation in the  decision-making process.    The signing of peace agreements and ceasefire  agreements and the implementation of national action  plans and programmes for the protection of <VIC>women</VIC> in  conflict-affected countries have made it possible to  identify, in a more appropriate way, the ways and means  likely to promote <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> rights and to strengthen their  participation in efforts to prevent and resolve conflicts  and in post-conflict reconstruction.    <HER>My delegation</HER> supports the initiatives of the <HER>Team  of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in  Conflict</HER> to assist <HER>States</HER> in strengthening the rule of  law, transitional justice and security sector reform. <HER>My  delegation</HER> also supports the elaboration by the <HER>Standing  Committee on Women, Peace and Security</HER> of the  strategic framework intended to assist <HER>Member States</HER>  in achieving their interim objectives, in preparation for  the meeting planned for 2015 on the implementation  of resolution 1325 (2000) at national, regional and  international levels.    Effective and optimal empowerment of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>  in the context of peacebuilding and post-conflict  reconstruction involves the collective and coordinated  action of the <HER>international community</HER> and the <HER>United  Nations system</HER>, through strengthening protection and  prevention measures adapted to specific contexts that  will facilitate the implementation of the resolution.    The establishment of genuine peace requires  the establishment of inclusive and durable political,  economic and social structures. Within that  framework, <HER_VIC>local women's</HER_VIC> entities are a driving  force in empowering <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and strengthening good  governance. <HER>My delegation</HER> welcomes the work carried  out in the framework of the <HER>United Nations system</HER>  to strengthen <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> capacities and involvement in  mediation and peacebuilding processes. Similarly, it  supports the implementation of the <HER>Secretary-General's  seven-point action plan</HER> (see S/2010/466), which enables  greater consideration of gender issues in peacebuilding  operations.    As for protection, <HER>my delegation</HER> notes with concern  that <VIC>refugee or displaced women</VIC> continue to suffer most  from generalized insecurity, difficult living conditions  and limited access to humanitarian assistance. The  same is true for <VIC>refugee women</VIC> who lack documents  and often face gender-based discrimination, especially  in accessing basic social services. In that connection,  it is essential that <HER>Member States</HER> - especially the  <HER>States parties to the 1951 Convention relating to the  Status of Refugees</HER> - comply with their obligations  and register <VIC>refugees</VIC> in their territory. Registration and  identification programmes can have a positive impact  in empowering <VIC>women refugees</VIC>.    <HER>My delegation</HER> welcomes the efforts undertaken  by the <HER>Department of Peacekeeping Operations  (DPKO)</HER> in the protection of <VIC>women</VIC> in armed conflict  and the consideration of gender-specific issues in the  framework of the maintenance of peace. We stress that  it is important that <HER>DPKO</HER> strengthen its work on the  ground, in coordination with the relevant parties.    While the responsibility to put an end to the tragic  consequences of armed conflict for <VIC>women and children</VIC>  lies with <HER>States</HER>, coordinated and sustained action  among the various <HER>national and United Nations actors</HER>  involved in the implementation of resolution 1325  (2000) is necessary to strengthen existing initiatives.    Firm political will and full commitment of <HER>Member  States</HER> to the measures in resolution 1325 (2000)  will guarantee the active participation of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in  <HER>national, regional and international institutions</HER> for  the prevention, protection and management of conflict  situations.",
    "UNSC_2016_SPV.7704_spch087.txt": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this annotation task step by step. First, I need to read through the entire speech carefully to identify all the entities that fit the Hero, Villain, or Victim roles based on the guidelines provided.\n\nStarting with the beginning, the speaker thanks France for organizing the debate. According to the guidelines, entities that are thanked or commended can be Heroes if they are actively helping. So France here is a Hero. Then Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his Special Representative Zainab Bangura are mentioned. Since they are commended for their presentations, they should be tagged as Heroes. The phrase \"all those who spoke before me\" is also thanked, so that's another Hero tag.\n\nNext, the speaker talks about the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) suffering from sexual violence. The country is mentioned as a Victim here because it's suffering from a scourge. The conflicts in the eastern part are described as causing human casualties and using rape as a weapon of war. The rebel armed groups are the ones causing harm, so they should be Villains. The victims here are the girls, women, boys, and men whose lives were disrupted, so they are Victims.\n\nThe report S/2016/36l from the Secretary-General is mentioned as attesting to progress. Since it's a UN document and the context shows it's contributing positively, it's a Hero. The DRC Government's efforts, like appointing a personal representative, adopting a plan of action, and signing a communique, are all Hero actions. The military justice system handling cases without regard for rank is Heroic. The compensation fund and committees working on the bill are also Heroic efforts.\n\nThe international community, Japan, Ms. Bangura's office, the United Nations Population Fund, and other partners are mentioned as providing support, so they are Heroes. The DRC's determination to continue efforts is another Hero tag.\n\nNow, checking for combined roles. The DRC is both a Victim (suffering) and a Hero (taking action), so HER_VIC. The Government of the DRC is a Hero. The rebel armed groups are Villains. The victims (girls, women, etc.) are Victims. The international supporters are Heroes. The UN resolutions or entities like the Secretary-General's report are Heroes.\n\nI need to make sure not to tag abstract concepts. For example, \"sexual violence\" itself isn't tagged, only the entities involved. Also, when the speaker mentions \"my country's Government,\" that's a Hero. The military justice system is part of the Government's efforts, so Hero. The compensation fund and committees are part of the Government's actions, so Hero.\n\nThe phrase \"survivors and demobilized fighters\" are Victims because they're receiving training, indicating they needed help. The women in Bunia receiving the credit fund are Victims being assisted, so Victim tag.\n\nI need to ensure that possessive modifiers are included, like \"my country's Government\" as a single Hero tag. Also, check for nested tags. For example, when the DRC is mentioned as a Victim but also taking Heroic actions, use HER_VIC. However, in the initial mention, the DRC is only a Victim, so just VIC. Later, when discussing their efforts, it's a Hero. Wait, the guidelines say the same entity can have different roles in different parts. So first, \"my country\" is VIC, then later when talking about their efforts, it's HER. But the combined tag is only when both roles are in the same context. Since the DRC is portrayed as both suffering (VIC) and acting (HER) in different parts, they should be tagged separately. However, in the conclusion, the country is determined to eradicate sexual violence, so that's HER. But in the initial mention, it's VIC. So no combined tag unless both roles are in the same mention. Wait, the example given had \"women\u2019s empowerment\" as HER_VIC because empowerment implies both needing help (VIC) and contributing (HER). In this case, the DRC is mentioned in different contexts. So in the first part, \"my country\" is VIC, later \"my country's Government\" is HER. So separate tags.\n\nAlso, the rebel armed groups are VIL. The victims (girls, women, boys, men) are VIC. The Government's actions are HER. The international community, Japan, etc., are HER. The personal representative of the President is part of the Government's efforts, so HER. The military justice system is HER. The compensation fund is HER. The Senate committees are HER. The \"Breaking the Silence\" campaign is HER. The national institute for professional training is HER. The credit fund for women is HER (since it's part of the Government's efforts) but the women themselves are VIC.\n\nWait, the women in Bunia receiving the credit fund are Victims being helped, so VIC. The fund is part of the Heroic efforts, but the fund itself isn't an entity to tag. The entities are the women, so VIC.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"survivors and demobilized fighters\" are Victims (survivors) and possibly Villains (fighters), but the context says they're receiving training, so maybe just VIC. Demobilized fighters could be former Villains, but the speaker is portraying them as being reintegrated, so perhaps as Victims here.\n\nThe key is to follow the speaker's portrayal. Since the demobilized fighters are being trained for reintegration, they might be seen as Victims needing help. So tag them as VIC.\n\nSo putting it all together, the annotations would be:\n\n- France: HER\n- Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his Special Representative Zainab Bangura: HER\n- all those who spoke before me: HER\n- my country (DRC) initially: VIC\n- rebel armed groups: VIL\n- girls, women, boys and men: VIC\n- the report (S/2016/36l): HER\n- my country's Government: HER\n- personal representative of the President: HER\n- Minister of National Defence: HER\n- military justice system: HER\n- compensation fund: HER (but wait, the fund is an abstract concept? No, it's an entity established by the Government, so maybe HER. But according to the guidelines, abstract concepts aren't tagged. The fund is an initiative, not a person or organization. So maybe not tag it. The committees are part of the Government, so HER. The \"Breaking the Silence\" campaign is an initiative, not an entity. The national institute for professional training is an organization, so HER. The international community, Japan, Ms. Bangura's office, United Nations Population Fund, partners: all HER.\n\nThe survivors and demobilized fighters: VIC. The women in Bunia: VIC.\n\nSo applying the tags accordingly, making sure to include entire noun phrases and possessive modifiers. Also, check for combined roles if any entity fits multiple in the same mention. For example, the DRC is mentioned as a Victim in one part and Hero in another, but not in the same span, so separate tags. The Government is consistently HER.\n</think>\n\nMr. Gata Mavita wa Lufuta (<VIC>Democratic Republic of the Congo</VIC>) (spoke in French): First of all, I  would like to thank <HER>France</HER> for organizing this debate.  I also commend <HER>Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  and his Special Representative Zainab Bangura</HER>, as  well as <HER>all those who spoke before me</HER>, for their very  useful presentations.    Sexual violence in conflict situations is a scourge  from which <VIC>my country</VIC>, the <VIC>Democratic Republic of  the Congo</VIC>, has long suffered. For more than a decade,  <VIC>my country</VIC> has experienced especially bloody armed  conflicts in the eastern part of its territory. <VIL>Those  conflicts, which have caused many human casualties,  are at the source ofthe practice ofusing rape as a weapon  of war</VIL>. The lives of <VIC>thousands of girls, women, boys  and men</VIC> have thus been disrupted. The consequences  of the situation psychologically, economically and in  medical terms are enormous.    This debate affords us an opportunity to once again  touch on the efforts of <HER>my country's Government</HER> to  combat this situation. The restoration of peace in the  part of the country formerly occupied by <VIL>rebel armed  groups</VIL> has brought major change. Enormous progress  has been made both in the fight against sexual violence  and at the level of responding to the needs of <VIC>victims</VIC>.  In referring to <VIC>my country</VIC>, <HER>the report (S/2016/36l) of  the Secretary-General</HER> attests to that in mentioning  the appreciable 80 per cent decline in the number of  cases of sexual violence in conflict areas. Among other  things, <HER>my Government</HER> attributes those results to the  following elements: <HER>the appointment of a personal  representative of the President of the Republic in charge  of the fight against sexual violence and the recruitment  of children</HER>; <HER>the adoption of a plan of action to combat  sexual violence among the armed forces and the  signing ofajoint communique on the issue between the  Government and the United Nations</HER>; <HER>the adoption of a  zero-tolerance policy</HER>; and <HER>the signing by the Minister  of National Defence of a decree on the responsibility  of the unit commanders of the Forces armees de la  Republique democratique du Congo for combating  sexual violence</HER>.    All of those steps reflect the will of <HER>the Government</HER>  to end this scourge and honour its international  commitments. Against that backdrop, <HER>the Government</HER>  is committed to addressing the various problems,  including deliveringjustice in the fight against impunity.  In that connection, 111 cases were decided in 2015 by  <HER>the military justice system</HER>, without regard for the rank  ofthe accused. We have also established <HER>a compensation  fund</HER>, while <HER>two Senate committees, on sexual violence  and on political, administrative and judicial issues</HER>, are    working on <HER>a bill proposed by the office of the personal  representative of the Head of State</HER>. On preventing  sexual violence, <HER>a regional campaign called \"Breaking  the Silence\"</HER> will be launched by September. On  socioeconomic reintegration, with the collaboration of  <HER>our national institute for professional training</HER>, training  was organized at Kibumba last September in various  economic sectors for <VIC>survivors and demobilized  fighters</VIC>. That type of training will continue this year  in Rutshuru in North Kivu and in Bunia and Aru in  Ituri and will train <VIC>2,000 people</VIC>. <HER>A $35,000 credit fund</HER>  was set up to meet the financial needs of <VIC>some women  in Bunia</VIC>. That progress has been made possible thanks  to <HER>the Government's own resources</HER>, with the technical  support of <HER>the international community</HER>, including  assistance from <HER>Japan</HER> via <HER>Ms. Bangura's office</HER>,  and <HER>the United Nations Population Fund</HER> and <HER>various  other partners</HER>.    In conclusion, <HER>my country</HER> is determined to continue  its efforts to completely eradicate sexual violence. We  highly value the support provided to us in that regard  by <HER>the United Nations</HER> and <HER>the international community</HER>."
