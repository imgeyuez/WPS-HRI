    "UNSC_2004_SPV.5066Resumption1_spch026.txt": "Mr. Kau (Fiji): We would like to thank you,  Mr. President, for having organized today's debate on  this issue. We also congratulate the <HER>Secretary-General</HER>  for his timely report on the follow-up to the full  implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) on <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>  and peace and security (S/2004/814).    While the <HER>Secretary-General's</HER> report shows that  there have been positive developments in the  implementation of the resolution, further concerted  efforts are needed to ensure that the issue of  implementation is fully addressed. The full  implementation of the resolution will continue to be a  challenge for the <HER>Security Council</HER> and for the <HER>United Nations</HER>.  <HER>Fiji</HER> attaches great importance to this subject, and  we commend the efforts made thus far by the <HER>Security Council</HER>, the <HER>General Assembly</HER>, the <HER>Economic and Social Council</HER> and its functional commissions and  other <HER>United Nations</HER> bodies and entities. We  commend, in particular, the efforts made by the <HER>United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM)</HER> and  by <HER>regional organizations</HER> and other bodies, including the <HER>Commonwealth Secretariat</HER>, which have been active  partners in following up this issue in <HER>Fiji</HER>. Our <HER>Ministry for Women, Social Welfare and Poverty Alleviation</HER> has  been the focal point of efforts to mainstream gender  perspectives in relation to critical peace and security  components in <HER>Government</HER> and other areas.    The necessary groundwork for the launching in  <HER>Fiji</HER> of national policies and strategies pursuant to  resolution 1325 (2000) has been greatly boosted by the  sponsorship and support of <HER>UNIFEM</HER>. and other <HER>actors</HER>, including <HER>civil society</HER>. Work on mainstreaming gender  perspectives in relation to conflict prevention,  peacekeeping operations, humanitarian assistance and  post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation is in  progress.    Recent political and internal upheavals in our  country have brought out the best in our <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>, and  their contribution has been a strong factor for good and  steady progress. They have been effective stabilizers  and mediators in conflict prevention and very active  players in recent efforts in post-conflict peace-building  and reconciliation processes. A week-long peace and  reconciliation process with the objective, inter alia, of  uniting our polarized and divided country, which was  held last month, saw <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and <HER_VIC>children</HER_VIC> playing key  roles. This was preceded by a national workshop on  conflict prevention and early warning.    In peacekeeping, <HER>Fiji</HER>, which is a staunch  supporter of and consistent contributor to international  peacekeeping missions, has introduced specific  measures to ensure the expansion of <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> role in  peacekeeping. Despite the difficulties in overcoming  cultural and traditional barriers, recent deployments  have seen the successful integration of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> into  various specialized duties, including guard duty. The  <HER>military</HER> and <HER>police departments</HER>, together with other  relevant <HER>bodies</HER>, are working on coherent strategies for  gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping. The <HER>Fiji</HER>  peacekeeping deployment to <HER>Iraq</HER> will include six  <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> who have been given specific training in  searching and in counselling. That also illustrates our  view that <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> can be as good as <HER>men</HER> in all areas if  given the opportunity.  We fully agree with the <HER>Secretary-General</HER> that  more effort must be put into capacity-building and  training. Gender mainstreaming in relation to all facets  of peace and security requires knowledge and  information-sharing. Training and capacity-building  must target not only <HER_VIC>girls</HER_VIC> and <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>, but also <HER>boys</HER> and <HER>men</HER> at all levels of <HER>government</HER> and the  <HER>community</HER>. It should be all-encompassing and  comprehensive, targeting both the formal and the non-  formal sectors. Its inclusion in the education  curriculum will ensure early intervention and sustained  impact. The <HER>Government</HER>, through the programmes of  its <HER>Ministry for Women</HER> and through the <HER>UNIFEM</HER>-  sponsored <HER>Women and Peace and Security Committee</HER>,  is addressing the issue with all relevant <HER>stakeholders</HER>.    In addition, there is a need for more effective  coordination and partnerships. There is certainly no  lack of will and enthusiasm at the national level,  particularly in developing <HER>countries</HER>, but enhanced  cooperation and partnership are vital to ensure the  inflow of the resources and expertise which are  generally lacking in our <HER>countries</HER>. We therefore  welcome the call by the <HER>Secretary-General</HER> for the  development and strengthening of cooperation and  effective partnerships at all levels. We acknowledge the  good work done by <HER>UNIFEM</HER>. and other <HER>United Nations</HER>  bodies, together with <HER>regional organizations</HER> such as the  <HER>Pacific Islands Forum</HER> and the <HER>Commonwealth Secretariat</HER>, in the <HER>Pacific region</HER>, including in <HER>Fiji</HER>. We  can only hope for more such cooperation and  partnerships.    We also commend the <HER>Secretary-General</HER> for his  recognition of the role of <HER_VIC>indigenous women</HER_VIC> in conflict  resolution as mediators and peace-builders. <HER_VIC>Indigenous</HER_VIC> and <HER_VIC>local women</HER_VIC> have a strong advocacy role, and it  should be utilized in all aspects of security and peace.    There is a need to ensure that national and  international efforts for the implementation of  resolution 1325 (2000) are undertaken in a  comprehensive manner in the context of the  Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of  Discrimination against <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and the <HER>Beijing Declaration</HER> and Platform for Action. To ensure  complementarity and proper coordination, every effort  must be undertaken in collaboration with, and within,  existing institutional arrangements.    <HER>Fiji</HER> has a total population of approximately  800,000, with <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> making up almost half of that  number. Given our small population, it was easy for us  to recognize the great potential that <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> represent.  In order to make progress, we had to harness all the  resources at our disposal, and <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> have played the  prominent role we expected - and more - in the  measured forward momentum towards our  developmental goals. Our support for the efforts of the  <HER>Security Council</HER> and the <HER>Secretary-General</HER> in the  furtherance of <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> participation in peace and  security is therefore absolute.",
    "UNSC_2009_SPV.6195_spch008.txt": "Mr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): I would  like to thank <HER>Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</HER> for    joining us at this important meeting of the <HER>Security  Council</HER>. We would also like to welcome to the <HER>Council  Chamber</HER> <HER>Mr. Bedouma Alain Yoda, Minister for  Foreign Affairs of Burkina Faso</HER>, and <HER>Mr. Alain  Joyandet, Minister of State for Cooperation and  Francophonie of France</HER>.    I would like in particular to welcome you,  <HER>Madam Secretary of State</HER>, and to acknowledge your  personal commitment and leadership, which have  created renewed impetus for the issue of the protection  of <VIC_VIL>women's</VIC_VIL> rights and the prevention of all forms of  violence against <VIC>women</VIC>. My <HER>delegation</HER> would also  like to thank the <HER>delegation of the United States</HER> for  leading negotiations on resolution 1888 (2009), which  has just been adopted.    With the unanimous adoption of that resolution,  the <HER>Security Council</HER> has reaffirmed its commitment to  the protection of <VIC>women</VIC> in armed conflict. The  significant number of <HER>delegations</HER> that joined in  sponsoring this initiative shows that the international  community is resolved to ensure that <VIC>women</VIC> and  <VIC>children</VIC> no longer remain the principal <VIC>victims</VIC> of the  armed conflicts which, deplorably, are occurring in  many parts of the world.    <HER>Council members</HER> were able to see for ourselves  the gravity of the acts of sexual violence against  <VIC>women</VIC> and <VIC>children</VIC> in areas of armed conflict in the  course of our visit to a number of <HER>African countries</HER> last  May, in particular the <HER>Democratic Republic of the  Congo</HER>. On that occasion we witnessed the  consequences of these crimes for <VIC>societies</VIC> and their  negative impact on efforts to find solutions to crisis  situations and promote an effective process of national  reconciliation. For that reason we wish to reiterate, as  does <HER>resolution 1888 (2009)</HER>, the primary obligation of  all <VIL>parties to an armed conflict</VIL> to respect and to  enforce at all times international humanitarian law,  which grants special protection to <VIC>women</VIC> and <VIC>children</VIC>.    My <HER>delegation</HER> believes that the establishment of  the post of <HER>Special Representative of the Secretary-  General</HER> on sexual violence in situations of armed  conflict will make it possible to improve the systematic  and comprehensive attention that the <HER>United Nations</HER> pays in response to sexual violence in these situations.    This new mandate should work in a coordinated  manner with other <HER>United Nations mechanisms and  agencies</HER> in order to harness synergies and to prevent  duplication. In particular, there is a broad relationship    between the objectives of <HER>resolution 1888 (2009)</HER> and  <HER>resolution 1882 (2009)</HER>, on <VIC>children</VIC> and armed conflict,  which was adopted by the <HER>Security Council</HER> last  August.    These common objectives must be duly explored  with a view to providing comprehensive protection for  all those who, due to their condition, suffer most from  the consequences of armed conflict, that is, <VIC>women</VIC> and  <VIC>children</VIC>. In the light of the aforementioned, we believe  that the <HER>Security Council</HER> must also pay close attention  to the ongoing negotiations on a composite gender  entity within the framework of the <HER>General Assembly</HER> and decide to review the mandate of the <HER>Special Representative</HER> in a reasonable period of time and in  the light of the results of the procedure outlined in  <HER>General Assembly resolution 63/311</HER>.    While more can be done at the international level  in order to prevent sexual violence in situations of  armed conflict, the eradication of sexual violence will  only be achieved if national capacities among those  <HER>States</HER> that are addressing situations of conflict are  improved with a view to bringing the <VIL>perpetrators of  such crimes</VIL> to justice.    Therefore, one of the most relevant aspects of the  <HER>resolution</HER> is the identification within the <HER>United Nations</HER> of a multidisciplinary team of <HER>experts</HER> who,  when their assistance is required and with the consent  of the <HER>State concerned</HER>, can be deployed to the field in  order to work jointly with the <HER>Government</HER> and the  <HER>United Nations system</HER> to undertake projects for  technical cooperation to strengthen the rule of law,  prevent impunity and address <VIC>victims'</VIC> needs.    It is clear that currently we have strong tools for  preventing sexual violence in areas of conflict. The  true challenge that we face is making full use of this  array of instruments, if we truly wish to ensure that  more <VIC>women</VIC> and <VIC>children</VIC> do not fall victim to the  spiral of violence that is caused by armed conflict.",
    "UNSC_2011_SPV.6642_spch055.txt": "Mr. Diallo (Senegal) (spoke in French): I would  like to convey my delegation's sincere congratulations  for the convening of this important debate on <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>,  peace and security, which represents, Madam  President, the crowning moment of your remarkable  presidency of the Council for the month of October. I  would like to thank the <HER>Secretary-General</HER> for his  statement, as well as <HER>Mr. Lazarous Kapambwe</HER>,  President of the <HER>Economic and Social Council</HER>,  <HER>Ms. Michelle Bachelet</HER>, Executive Director of  <HER>UN-Women</HER>, and <HER>Ms. Orzala Ashraf Nemat</HER>,  representative of <HER>civil society</HER>, for their important  contributions.    My delegation has a special interest in the topic,  because <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> represented an  enormous step forward in the protection of <VIC>women</VIC> and  highlighted the importance of their role in all aspects  of <HER>United Nations</HER> peacekeeping. Nonetheless, while it  has remained far from being a cure-all, <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> has contributed, along with <HER>resolutions 1820 (2008)</HER>, <HER>1888 (2009)</HER> and <HER>1889 (2009)</HER>, to improving the  normative framework for preventing gender-based  violence and for protecting <VIC>women</VIC> against that  scourge.    It should, however, be pointed out that, despite  those praiseworthy efforts, persistent shortcomings  have exposed thousands of <VIC>women and girls</VIC> to various  types of barbaric abuse and atrocities. In fact, rape  continues to be used as a weapon of war in certain  conflict areas, and the ongoing existence of sexual and  gender-based violence, even at the end of a conflict,  represents an almost permanent threat to the security  and health of that vulnerable group of the population.  That is why the <HER>international community</HER> must firmly  commit to vigorously combating impunity in order to  guarantee the effective prevention of all forms of  violence against <VIC>women</VIC>.    While welcoming the zero tolerance policy on  sexual violence of the <HER>Secretary-General</HER>, we must, in  addition, insist on the need to bolster the role of  <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in conflict-prevention and resolution.  Nevertheless, the poor results in that area have  undoubtedly been due to the continuing low  participation of <VIC>women</VIC> in the drafting of  implementation strategies. I consider it crucial,  therefore, to foster <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> participation by reserving  a key role for them in conflict-prevention policies, as  well as policies on peacekeeping, peacebuilding and  social and economic recovery. In that context, there  must be a special focus on <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> empowerment,  which will require significant investment in education,  training and maternal health.    In View of our considerable awareness of that  dynamic process, my country, <HER>Senegal</HER>, has allocated a  significant part of its budget to education and health,  and on 14 May 2010, it adopted a law to establish full  parity in all partially or fully elected bodies. In that  manner, <HER>Senegal</HER> intends to ensure the effective  participation of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in decision-making processes.  To follow up on that law, a national gender-parity  monitoring body was set up and will be officially  inaugurated on 16 November.    <HER>Senegal</HER> has already adopted its national action  plan to implement <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>.  Furthermore, it has sought to make a positive  contribution to drafting the action plan of the  <HER>Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)</HER> and the <HER>Dakar Declaration</HER> by focusing on  the four following areas: first, effective participation of  <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in the peace process; secondly, protection of  <VIC>women and girls</VIC>; thirdly, prevention of gender-based  violence through preventive diplomacy and early  warning systems, and fourthly, reconstruction and  victim assistance.  It is certain that those significant national and  regional level initiatives are welcome. However, they  will achieve the desired success only if linked with an  international dynamic inspired by the <HER>Security Council</HER> and based on coordinated efforts on the part of  <HER>UN-Women</HER> and all of the other relevant bodies. There  is also a need to improve <VIC>women's</VIC> involvement in  peacekeeping operations by following up on the  laudable efforts already carried out in that domain.    The effective prevention of sexual violence also  requires stringent measures to vigorously combat the  root causes of conflict exacerbation. Since there is an  established link between what is known as low-level  conflicts and wide-scale violence against <VIC>women</VIC>, I  would like to launch an appeal for coordinated and  focused action against the illicit trade in small arms  and light weapons. In that regard, my delegation  cherishes the hope that the diplomatic conference of  2012 will enable the adoption of a robust arms trade  treaty.    Allow me to conclude by expressing my  country's, <HER>Senegal's</HER>, conviction that the efforts to be undertaken  by 2015 will enable the <HER>Security Council</HER> to take stock  at that time of the positive implementation of  <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>.",
    "UNSC_2013_SPV.7044_spch013.txt": "Mr. Laassel (Morocco) (spoke in French): Allow  me at the outset to convey to you, Sir, on behalf of the  <HER>Moroccan delegation</HER>, our gratitude for the convening  of this debate. I thank for their briefings <HER>Secretary-  General Ban Ki-moon</HER>; <HER>Ms. Navanethem Pillay</HER>, <HER>High  Commissioner for Human Rights</HER>; and <HER>Ms. Phumzile  Mlambo-Ngcuka</HER>, <HER>Executive Director of UN Women</HER>.  I welcome <HER>Ms. Mlambo-Ngcuka's</HER> appointment and  assure her of our full cooperation and support as she  discharges her mission. We also thank <HER>Ms. Brigitte  Balipou</HER>, <HER>Chair of the NGO Working Group on Women,  Peace and Security</HER>, for her constructive contribution.    My <HER>delegation</HER> welcomes the report of the <HER>Secretary-  General</HER> on <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>, peace and security (S/2013/525)  and the adoption of <HER>resolution 2122</HER> (2013) on the issue.  The report takes stock of the actions and initiatives of  <HER>Member States</HER> in the framework of implementation  of the <HER>resolution</HER>, especially in strengthening <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC>  participation in decision-making, integrating gender-  specific issues in peacekeeping operations and  training staff who participate in those operations.  The report confirms that much work remains, despite  the significant progress of <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> participation in  peacekeeping operations and their representation in the  decision-making process.    The signing of peace agreements and ceasefire  agreements and the implementation of national action  plans and programmes for the protection of <VIC>women</VIC> in  conflict-affected countries have made it possible to  identify, in a more appropriate way, the ways and means  likely to promote <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> rights and to strengthen their  participation in efforts to prevent and resolve conflicts  and in post-conflict reconstruction.    My <HER>delegation</HER> supports the initiatives of the <HER>Team  of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in  Conflict</HER> to assist <HER>States</HER> in strengthening the rule of  law, transitional justice and security sector reform. My  <HER>delegation</HER> also supports the elaboration by the <HER>Standing  Committee on Women, Peace and Security</HER> of the  strategic framework intended to assist <HER>Member States</HER>  in achieving their interim objectives, in preparation for  the meeting planned for 2015 on the implementation  of <HER>resolution 1325</HER> (2000) at national, regional and  international levels.    Effective and optimal empowerment of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>  in the context of peacebuilding and post-conflict  reconstruction involves the collective and coordinated  action of the <HER>international community</HER> and the <HER>United  Nations system</HER>, through strengthening protection and  prevention measures adapted to specific contexts that  will facilitate the implementation of the <HER>resolution</HER>.    The establishment of genuine peace requires  the establishment of inclusive and durable political,  economic and social structures. Within that  framework, <HER>local women's entities</HER> are a driving  force in empowering <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and strengthening good  governance. My <HER>delegation</HER> welcomes the work carried  out in the framework of the <HER>United Nations system</HER>  to strengthen <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> capacities and involvement in  mediation and peacebuilding processes. Similarly, it  supports the implementation of the <HER>Secretary-General's</HER>  seven-point action plan (see S/2010/466), which enables  greater consideration of gender issues in peacebuilding  operations.    As for protection, my <HER>delegation</HER> notes with concern  that <VIC>refugee or displaced women</VIC> continue to suffer most  from generalized insecurity, difficult living conditions  and limited access to humanitarian assistance. The  same is true for <VIC>refugee women</VIC> who lack documents  and often face gender-based discrimination, especially  in accessing basic social services. In that connection,  it is essential that <HER>Member States</HER> - especially the  <HER>States parties to the 1951 Convention relating to the  Status of Refugees</HER> - comply with their obligations  and register <VIC>refugees</VIC> in their territory. Registration and  identification programmes can have a positive impact  in empowering <HER_VIC>women refugees</HER_VIC>.    My <HER>delegation</HER> welcomes the efforts undertaken  by the <HER>Department of Peacekeeping Operations</HER>  (DPKO) in the protection of <VIC>women</VIC> in armed conflict  and the consideration of gender-specific issues in the  framework of the maintenance of peace. We stress that  it is important that <HER>DPKO</HER> strengthen its work on the  ground, in coordination with the relevant <HER>parties</HER>.    While the responsibility to put an end to the tragic  consequences of armed conflict for <VIC>women and children</VIC>  lies with <HER>States</HER>, coordinated and sustained action  among the various national and <HER>United Nations actors</HER>  involved in the implementation of <HER>resolution 1325</HER>  (2000) is necessary to strengthen existing initiatives.    Firm political will and full commitment of <HER>Member States</HER>  to the measures in <HER>resolution 1325</HER> (2000)  will guarantee the active participation of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in  national, regional and international institutions for  the prevention, protection and management of conflict  situations.",
    "UNSC_2016_SPV.7704_spch087.txt": "Mr. Gata Mavita wa Lufuta (Democratic Republic of the Congo) (spoke in French): First of all, I  would like to thank <HER>France</HER> for organizing this debate.  I also commend <HER>Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</HER>  and his <HER>Special Representative Zainab Bangura</HER>, as  well as all those who spoke before me, for their very  useful presentations.    Sexual violence in conflict situations is a scourge  from which my country, the <HER_VIC>Democratic Republic of  the Congo</HER_VIC>, has long suffered. For more than a decade,  my country has experienced especially bloody armed  conflicts in the eastern part of its territory. Those  conflicts, which have caused many human casualties,  are at the source ofthe practice ofusing rape as a weapon  of war. The lives of thousands of <VIC>girls, women, boys  and men</VIC> have thus been disrupted. The consequences  of the situation psychologically, economically and in  medical terms are enormous.    This debate affords us an opportunity to once again  touch on the efforts of my country's <HER>Government</HER> to  combat this situation. The restoration of peace in the  part of the country formerly occupied by <VIL>rebel armed  groups</VIL> has brought major change. Enormous progress  has been made both in the fight against sexual violence  and at the level of responding to the needs of <VIC>victims</VIC>.  In referring to my country, the report (S/2016/36l) of  the <HER>Secretary-General</HER> attests to that in mentioning  the appreciable 80 per cent decline in the number of  cases of sexual violence in conflict areas. Among other  things, my <HER>Government</HER> attributes those results to the  following elements: the appointment of a personal  representative of the <HER>President of the Republic</HER> in charge  of the fight against sexual violence and the recruitment  of <VIC>children</VIC>; the adoption of a plan of action to combat  sexual violence among the <VIL>armed forces</VIL> and the  signing ofajoint communique on the issue between the  <HER>Government</HER> and the <HER>United Nations</HER>; the adoption of a  zero-tolerance policy; and the signing by the <HER>Minister  of National Defence</HER> of a decree on the responsibility  of the unit commanders of the <HER>Forces armees de la  Republique democratique du Congo</HER> for combating  sexual violence.    All of those steps reflect the will of the <HER>Government</HER>  to end this scourge and honour its international  commitments. Against that backdrop, the <HER>Government</HER>  is committed to addressing the various problems,  including deliveringjustice in the fight against impunity.  In that connection, 111 cases were decided in 2015 by  the <HER>military justice system</HER>, without regard for the rank  ofthe accused. We have also established a compensation  fund, while two <HER>Senate committees</HER>, on <VIC>sexual violence</VIC>  and on political, administrative and judicial issues, are    working on a bill proposed by the office of the personal  representative of the <HER>Head of State</HER>. On preventing  <VIC>sexual violence</VIC>, a regional campaign called \"Breaking  the Silence\" will be launched by September. On  socioeconomic reintegration, with the collaboration of  our <HER>national institute for professional training</HER>, training  was organized at Kibumba last September in various  economic sectors for <VIC>survivors</VIC> and <VIC>demobilized  fighters</VIC>. That type of training will continue this year  in Rutshuru in North Kivu and in Bunia and Aru in  Ituri and will train 2,000 <VIC>people</VIC>. A $35,000 credit fund  was set up to meet the financial needs of some <VIC>women</VIC>  in Bunia. That progress has been made possible thanks  to the <HER>Government's</HER> own resources, with the technical  support of the <HER>international community</HER>, including  assistance from <HER>Japan</HER> via <HER>Ms. Bangura's</HER> office,  and the <HER>United Nations Population Fund</HER> and various  other <HER>partners</HER>.    In conclusion, my <HER_VIC>country</HER_VIC> is determined to continue  its efforts to completely eradicate <VIC>sexual violence</VIC>. We  highly value the support provided to us in that regard  by the <HER>United Nations</HER> and the <HER>international community</HER>."
