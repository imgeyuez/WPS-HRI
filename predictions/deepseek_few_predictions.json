    "UNSC_2000_SPV.4208_spch004.txt": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this annotation task step by step. The goal is to label entities in the speech as Hero, Villain, Victim, or combinations, following the guidelines provided.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the speech carefully and identify all the entities mentioned: people, organizations, countries, groups, and UN resolutions if they're personified. The annotations should be based on how the speaker portrays these entities, not external knowledge.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the speaker is Ms. King, the Special Adviser on Gender Issues. She mentions \"the Council\" (Security Council) deciding to hold a debate on \"Women and peace and security.\" The Council here is being proactive, so likely Hero. \n\nNext, she refers to \"Your country's strong leadership\" (Namibia's presidency) leading to the Windhoek Declaration. Since Namibia is taking positive action, they're Heroes. The Windhoek Declaration and Namibia Plan of Action are initiatives that help, so they should be Heroes. \n\nShe mentions \"women and girls in armed conflict\" as victims, so those phrases would be Victim tags. However, when discussing women's roles beyond being victims, like participating in peace processes, they might be Heroes or combined roles. For example, \"women as actors in the peace process\" \u2013 here, women are both Heroes (actors) and possibly Victims (if they're also affected). \n\nThe Secretary-General's role in visiting conflict areas and his efforts would make him a Hero. The Brahimi Panel's report is mentioned in the context of improving peace operations, so the Panel is a Hero. \n\nWhen discussing peacekeeping missions like in Bosnia, Cambodia, etc., the missions themselves aren't tagged unless they're personified. However, the study \"Mainstreaming a Gender Perspective...\" is an initiative by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), which is an organization acting positively, so DPKO is a Hero. \n\nReferences to local women mobilizing for peace committees, voter education, etc., show them as Heroes. However, when they're victims of sexual violence or conflict, they're Victims. For example, \"local women are more likely to confide in women peacekeepers on such matters as rape\" \u2013 \"local women\" here are Victims. \n\nThe study's findings about women's participation leading to better outcomes would tag the women involved as Heroes. Mixed teams of women and men contributing positively are Heroes. \n\nEntities like the Department of Political Affairs, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, etc., are part of the UN system working towards peace, so Heroes. \n\nMentions of \"women's groups\" and \"grass-roots women's organizations\" actively building peace are Heroes. However, when discussing their underrepresentation, like \"women are not present in formal peace negotiations,\" they're Victims. \n\nThe Beijing Platform for Action, Windhoek Declaration, etc., are initiatives promoting gender equality, so they're Heroes. \n\nReferences to \"women's right to participate\" and \"equal partners\" indicate Hero roles. However, when discussing exclusion from decision-making, they become Victims. \n\nThe Brahimi report's recommendation to appoint a woman as Assistant Secretary-General in DPKO \u2013 the report is a Hero, and the recommendation is a Hero action. \n\nIn the closing, the emphasis on gender equality as essential for peace tags \"gender equality\" as an abstract concept, which shouldn't be tagged. But references to women's participation being necessary tag \"women\" as Heroes and Victims (since they need empowerment). \n\nNeed to be careful not to tag abstract concepts like \"peace\", \"development\", or \"human rights\". Also, ensure that when entities are mentioned in a positive, active role, they're Heroes, and when they're suffering or excluded, they're Victims. Villains are less present here, but any groups causing harm would be tagged as such. In this speech, the main focus is on Heroes and Victims, with possible combined roles where women are both empowered and victimized.\n</think>\n\nMs. King: I am particularly honoured today, as  Special Adviser on Gender Issues, to have the  opportunity to speak in this debate, which is so  historic, when for the first time <HER>the Council</HER> has decided  to devote an entire open discussion to the topic  \"<HER_VIC>Women</HER_VIC> and peace and security\".    It is only fairly recently that the experience of  <VIC>women and girls</VIC> in armed conflict has been discussed,  and then discussion has usually concentrated on their  role as victims. Today's debate will show that <HER>we</HER> have  come a long way in a relatively short time. <HER>Your  country's strong leadership</HER>, Mr. President, in holding  the landmark May seminar which marked this year's  tenth anniversary of <HER>the United Nations Transition  Assistance Group</HER> resulted in the historic <HER>Windhoek  Declaration</HER> and <HER>Namibia Plan of Action</HER> on  \"Mainstreaming a Gender Perspective in  Multidimensional Peace Support Operations\". This  achievement has won universal admiration among all  those fighting for <HER_VIC>women\u2019s</HER_VIC> right to participate in all  aspects of the peace process. It and <HER>your</HER> distinguished  chairing of <HER>the General Assembly's</HER> twenty-third  special session, \"<HER_VIC>Women</HER_VIC> 2000: gender equality,  development and peace for the twenty-first century\",  which immediately followed in June, constitute  important steps along the way to considering the  <HER>United Nations</HER> peace operations from the point of view  of both <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and men.    Other important developments have led to today's  meeting. They include <HER>the Council's</HER> decision to take a  thematic approach to its work; the recognition that <HER>the  Council</HER> gave - under the chair of <HER>Bangladesh</HER> - on  International <HER_VIC>Women's</HER_VIC> Day, 8 March, to <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> as  actors in the peace process; the discussion on the  situation of <VIC>women in Afghanistan</VIC>, which took place in  April, led by <HER>the representative of Canada</HER>; and the  <HER>Council's</HER> resolution 1314 (2000) of 11 August.    The timeliness of this discussion is also  significant. <HER>The Secretary-General</HER> has just returned  from an area where he undoubtedly had an opportunity  to see at first hand the role <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and men should  play in their societies to bring about peace and to  rebuild those societies. The discussion also coincides  with the consideration of <HER>the Brahimi Panel's</HER> report  (8/2000/809) on peace operations and its  implementation.    There are three broad areas to be considered in  the context of today's discussion: how armed conflict  affects <VIC>women</VIC>; how <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> actually respond to  conflict, the peace process and post-conflict  reconstruction; and how <HER>we</HER> plan strategically for a  future in which <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> are equal partners with men in  enhancing our effectiveness in peace operations.    Today I would like to concentrate on the two  latter points, drawing on my experience as Chief of  Mission in <HER>the United Nations Observer Mission in  South Africa (UNOMSA)</HER>.    What do <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> actually do in conflict situations,  and how do <VIC>they</VIC> respond? <HER>The Secretary-General</HER> has  repeatedly emphasized the changing nature of war. He  has noted that modern warfare is increasingly  conducted within, rather than between, States, and that  <HER>the Security Council</HER> is now called on to deal with such  conflicts. He has stressed that more and more non-State  actors are protagonists in armed conflict; even <VIC>children</VIC>  become involved. The proliferation of small arms and  the ease with which <VIC>they</VIC> can be acquired, clearly  shown in <HER>the Department for Disarmament Affairs</HER> and  <HER>Department of Public Information</HER> video documentary  \"Armed to the Teeth\", has also added a new dimension.    The socio-economic fabric of a country has now  to be the major focus of attention. Societal dynamics  thus become a key guide to finding entry points into  resolving disputes. Groups within each society, and  especially <HER_VIC>women's groups</HER_VIC>, non-governmental,  religious and other groups, have a major role to play.  Whether these groups were formed before the conflict  or during it is not important. What is important is that  <HER>they</HER> must be part of all stages of the peace  negotiations, in planning for the future, in rebuilding  and in crafting preventive strategies to avoid conflict.    Often, those of us who have seen the value of  <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> participation in peace operations at first hand  are challenged by the sceptics to present empirical  rather than anecdotal findings. In this connection, I am  pleased to report on the results of a joint three-year  effort of <HER>the Department of Peacekeeping Operations  (DPKO)</HER>, <HER>my office</HER> and <HER>the Division for the  Advancement of Women</HER> of <HER>the Department of  Economic and Social Affairs</HER>, a study that was  supported by the generous funding of several <HER>Member  States</HER>. This study, \"<HER>Mainstreaming a Gender  Perspective in Multidimensional Peace Operations</HER>\" has  just been finalized.  The study looks at five peace operations, in  <VIC>Bosnia and Herzegovina</VIC>, <VIC>Cambodia</VIC>, <VIC>El Salvador</VIC>,  <VIC>Namibia</VIC> and <VIC>South Africa</VIC>. It answers the sceptics by  giving objective and empirical findings on what  <HER>women staff</HER> do in missions; whether and how <HER>they</HER>  influence the outcomes; and how their participating  equally with men can improve the efficiency of <HER>United  Nations peacekeeping</HER>. <HER>The Windhoek Declaration</HER> and  <HER>the Namibia Plan of Action</HER> were informed by these  findings.    Exactly what does this study tell us? It shows  unequivocally that when there is a critical mass of  <HER>women</HER> in a mission - at least 30 per cent - <VIC>local  women</VIC> are more easily mobilized to join peace  committees. This occurred in <VIC>South Africa</VIC>, <VIC>El Salvador</VIC>  and <VIC>Namibia</VIC>, where <HER>women</HER> actively promoted voter  education and the rights of individual <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> to vote.  In other words, <HER>women's</HER> participation in <HER>United  Nations missions</HER> empowers <VIC>local women</VIC> and may  inspire <HER>them</HER> to organize for the achievement of a  democratic society.    <HER>Women's</HER> participation has the capacity to expand  the debate a little further so that it may encompass  more diverse subjects, including those that may be  more relevant to <VIC>women and children</VIC>. <HER>Women</HER> are  frequently less hierarchical in dealing with <VIC>local  communities</VIC> and listen more, thereby having better  insights into the root causes of conflict. <VIC>Local women</VIC>  are more likely to confide in <HER>women peacekeepers</HER> on  such matters as rape and other sexual violence. The  presence of a critical mass of <HER>women</HER> appears to foster  confidence and trust among <VIC>the local population</VIC>, and  this is critical to successful operations, such as in <VIC>El  Salvador</VIC>. <HER>Women</HER> are active negotiators and able to see  more clearly issues that affect <VIC>women</VIC> differently than  men.    <HER>Women's</HER> participation in all aspects of a mission  can help to break down stereotypes held by <VIC>women</VIC> in  many <VIC>local communities</VIC>, especially where <HER>women  peacekeepers</HER> serve in a broad spectrum of the activities  of a mission. This has had a spin-off effect on the  participation of <HER>local women</HER> in decision-making  positions. <HER>Women political monitors</HER> are just as willing  and capable of serving in dangerous or isolated areas as  men, and do so just as effectively.    The study also shows that mixed teams of <HER>women  and men</HER>, a significant proportion of <HER>women team  leaders</HER>, <HER>women special representatives</HER> or <HER>heads of  mission</HER>, or a conscious effort by a <HER>special  representative</HER> to seek the best staff, whether <HER>women</HER> or  men, has a positive influence on the outcome. <HER>Women</HER>  also respond by participating in <HER>the troop-contributing  countries' military and civilian police contingents</HER>. <HER>The  Department of Peacekeeping Operations</HER> has made  strenuous efforts to encourage <HER>Member States</HER> to send  <HER>women</HER> on missions, on the basis of equity, as their  presence can assist in defusing potentially tense  situations. Much more should be done in order to  encourage <HER>women</HER> to enter this service.    What do this and other studies tell us about what  <VIC>local women</VIC> do? There is abundant evidence to show  that even when having to flee to safety with their  families or protecting <VIC>them</VIC> in refugee or displaced-  persons camps, <HER>women</HER> take on a number of peace-  building activities.    <HER>Women</HER> are active at both formal and informal  levels. With few exceptions, <VIC>women</VIC> are not present in  formal peace negotiations. However, <HER>women</HER> have been  part of these negotiations, as <HER>we</HER> saw in the field in  <VIC>Burundi</VIC>, and in <VIC>Guatemala</VIC> and <VIC>South Africa</VIC>. <HER>Somali  women</HER> helped to bring <VIL>the clan leaders</VIL> back into the  negotiations at one stage and were permitted to join the  negotiations as observers.    Most of the activities, however, take place at the  informal level. <HER>Grass-roots women's organizations</HER> in  several countries have sponsored peace education;  encouraged <VIC>child soldiers</VIC> to lay down arms; organized  groups advocating peace across party and ethnic lines;  organized campaigns against small arms, such as <HER>the  Organization of African Unity (OAU) African  Women's Committee on peace and development</HER>;  influenced repatriation processes and established  services for <VIC>returning exiles</VIC>, such as in <VIC>Guatemala</VIC>;  contributed to ending conflict; negotiated the release of  <VIC>hostages</VIC>; and established legal support groups to get  recognition for <VIC>women's</VIC> rights to land and household  property which may have been in the name of a spouse  killed or \"disappeared\" in a conflict.    <HER>Women at the local level</HER> are a rich resource  waiting to be systematically tapped by <HER>the international  community</HER>. Many aspects of these informal activities  have been encouraged, supported financially and  documented by <HER>the United Nations</HER> and its agencies. In  this connection, in addition to the work of <HER>the  Department of Peacekeeping Operations</HER>, <HER>the  Department of Political Affairs</HER>, <HER>the Office for the  Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</HER> and <HER>the  Department for Disarmament Affairs</HER> should be  mentioned. Special mention should also be made of the  work of <HER>the Office of the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees</HER>, <HER>the Office of the High  Commissioner for Human Rights</HER>, <HER>the United Nations  Children's Fund</HER>, <HER>the World Food Programme</HER> and <HER>the  World Health Organization</HER>. <HER>The United Nations  Development Programme (UNDP)</HER>, <HER>the United Nations  Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM)</HER> and <HER>the  United Nations Centre for Human Settlements  (Habitat)</HER> should also be credited with pioneering work  at the national and grass-roots levels. Good practices  have been identified, studied and published, including  the study by <HER>the United Nations Research Institute for  Social Development</HER>, \"<HER>Women and Post-Conflict  Reconstruction</HER>\". The exchange of information on these  practices has enabled <HER>the United Nations system</HER> to  encourage <HER>States</HER> engaged in rehabilitation to work in  partnership with and sustain <HER>women's groups</HER> and <HER>civil  society</HER> engaged in these essential but often  unrecognized activities. Capacity-building for  leadership and governance led by <HER>UNDP</HER> and <HER>UNIFEM</HER>  has greatly facilitated <HER>women's</HER> ability to play  constructive roles.    These entities are all members of <HER>the  Administrative Committee on Coordination's Inter-  Agency Committee on Women and Gender Equality</HER>,  which I chair. <HER>We</HER> have lately formed a <HER>Task Force on  Women and Peace and Security</HER> to strengthen  collaboration on this critical issue.    This brings me to our vision for the future. The  basic blueprint appears in <HER>the Beijing Platform for  Action</HER>, <HER>the Beijing + 5 outcome document</HER>, <HER>the  Windhoek Declaration</HER> and <HER>the Namibia Plan of Action</HER>.  It also appears in the many powerful statements from  <HER>women's groups</HER> that <HER>we</HER> heard yesterday in the  <HER>Council's</HER> Arria-formula meeting.    The planning of any",
    "UNSC_2005_SPV.5294_spch027.txt": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this annotation task step by step. First, I need to carefully read the provided speech by Mr. Wang Guangya from China and identify all the entities that fit the roles of Hero, Villain, or Victim based on the guidelines.\n\nStarting with the opening, the speaker thanks several individuals and entities. According to the guidelines, entities like the Secretary-General, Under-Secretary-General, and others who are thanked for their contributions or roles in implementing resolutions should be tagged as Heroes. So \"Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan\", \"Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Guehenno\", \"Ms. Rachel Mayanja\", \"Ms. Noeleen Heyzer\" would be <HER> tags. Also, \"the Secretariat, the relevant peacekeeping operations, the Special Adviser... United Nations Development Fund for Women and Member States\" are Heroes because they contributed to implementing resolution 1325.\n\nResolution 1325 (2000) is mentioned multiple times. Since it's a UN resolution and the text says it \"provided guidance\" and is being implemented, it's personified here. So each mention of resolution 1325 should be tagged as Hero. However, in the phrase \"implementation of resolution 1325 (2000)\", it's not personified, so no tag there. But when it's said that \"resolution 1325 (2000) ... provided guidance\", that's a Hero tag.\n\nNext, looking at Victims. The speech mentions \"women\" as primary victims of armed conflicts. So phrases like \"primary victims of armed conflicts\" would tag \"women\" as <VIC>. Also, \"mothers, wives and daughters\" shedding tears are Victims. However, when women are described as participants in peace processes, they might be Heroes. But the example in the guidelines says if they are both victims and heroes, use combined tags. For instance, \"women are both the primary victims... and indispensable participants\" would be <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>.\n\nVillains are trickier here. The speech talks about perpetrators of violence against women, like \"perpetrators must be brought to justice\". But \"perpetrators\" aren't specifically named entities, just a general term. According to the guidelines, generic terms like \"perpetrators\" can be tagged if no specific entity is mentioned. Wait, but the guidelines say in section 5: \"Only annotate generic role terms (like 'victim') when no other specification is included.\" So if the text says \"perpetrators of violence\", and no specific group is named, then \"perpetrators\" could be Villains. However, in the speech, the exact phrase is \"violence against women must be more seriously investigated and its perpetrators must be brought to justice.\" Here, \"perpetrators\" is a generic term, so according to guideline 5, since no specific entity is mentioned, \"perpetrators\" would be tagged as <VIL>.\n\nLooking at the entities to tag: people, organizations, countries, groups, and personified UN resolutions. The Department of Peacekeeping Operations is an organization and mentioned as having mandated protection of women, so that's a Hero. \"General Assembly\", \"Economic and Social Council\" are organizations contributing to women's issues, so Heroes when their roles are active.\n\nNow, checking for combined roles. When women are described both as victims and heroes, like \"indispensable participants\", that's Hero and Victim. So \"women\" in that context would be <HER_VIC>.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"mothers, wives and daughters\" are victims of war's horrors, so <VIC>. The mention of \"sisters worldwide\" as wanting happy lives would be Victims as well.\n\nThe Security Council is mentioned in the context of coordinating activities. Since they are taking action, they might be Heroes. But in example 2, the Security Council was tagged as HER_VIL because of mixed roles, but here it's more about coordination, so likely Hero.\n\nNeed to ensure not to tag abstract concepts. For example, \"gender equality\" is an abstract concept, so not tagged. \"Protection of women\" is a concept, but \"women\" themselves are entities. So \"protection of women\" isn't tagged, but \"women\" when they're victims or heroes are.\n\nAlso, the Chinese saying \"women hold up half the sky\" \u2013 here, women are portrayed positively, so Hero? But the guideline says not to tag predicate nominatives unless they're entities. Since it's a saying, maybe not. Wait, the example in the guidelines had \"women\u2019s participation\" where \"women\" was tagged as HER_VIC. Here, \"women hold up half the sky\" is a metaphor, but \"women\" are the entity. Since they're being praised for their role, that's Hero. So <HER>women</HER> in that phrase.\n\nChecking for overlapping annotations. For example, \"the Department of Peacekeeping Operations has mandated that enhanced protection of women be a very important component...\" Here, \"Department of Peacekeeping Operations\" is a Hero, and \"women\" are Victims. So separate tags.\n\nAnother point: \"world leaders once again stressed the important role of women...\" Here, \"world leaders\" are Heroes, and \"women\" as Hero_Vic? Since they're being recognized for their role, but also victims. Wait, in the sentence, it's about their role in conflict resolution, so maybe just Hero. But earlier they were primary victims. So in different parts, \"women\" might have different tags. So in \"the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts\", women are Heroes. So <HER>women</HER>. But in \"women are both the primary victims...\", it's <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>.\n\nAlso, \"peacekeeping operations\" as entities when they're mentioned as having gender advisers or mandated protection would be Heroes. So \"the Department of Peacekeeping Operations\" is <HER>, and \"peacekeeping operations\" in general when they're doing positive things.\n\nNow, applying all these to the text, making sure to tag each entity correctly, include entire noun phrases, and follow the spacing and punctuation exactly as in the original.\n</think>\n\nMr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese):  I wish at the outset to thank <HER>you, Mr. President</HER>, for  initiating and organizing today's meeting. I thank <HER>the  Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan</HER>, for his report on  the United Nations system-wide action plan  (S/2005/636). Our thanks go also to <HER>Under-Secretary-  General Jean-Marie Guehenno</HER>, <HER>Ms. Rachel Mayanja</HER>,  <HER>Ms. Noeleen Heyzer</HER> and other participants for their  presentations this morning.    In his report, <HER>the Secretary-General</HER> makes many  concrete recommendations for further implementation  by <HER>the United Nations system</HER> of <HER>resolution 1325  (2000)</HER>. We welcome his recommendations and express  the hope that they can be effectively implemented.    This year marks both the fifth anniversary of the  adoption of <HER>Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>  and the tenth anniversary of the Fourth World  Conference on Women, held in Beijing. Those  anniversaries lend particular significance to this open  debate on the question of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and peace and  security.    Five years ago <HER>the Security Council</HER> adopted  <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>, which focused <HER>the international  community</HER>'s attention on the question of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and  armed conflict and which provided guidance for the  endeavour to promote gender equality, protect <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>'s  rights and expand the role played by <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>. In the  five years since then - thanks to the efforts of <HER>the  Secretariat</HER>, <HER>the relevant peacekeeping operations</HER>, <HER>the  Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Gender  Issues and Advancement of Women</HER>, <HER>the United  Nations Development Fund for Women</HER> and <HER>Member  States</HER> - much has been achieved in implementation of  <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>. <HER>The international  community</HER> now attaches greater importance to the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>  in the settlement of armed conflicts, and <HER>the  Department of Peacekeeping Operations</HER> has mandated  that enhanced protection of <VIC>women</VIC> be a very important  component of the daily work of peacekeeping  operations. Both at Headquarters and in many  peacekeeping operations, gender advisers have been  appointed.    At the recent High-level Plenary Meeting of <HER>the  General Assembly</HER>, <HER>world leaders</HER> once again stressed  the important role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in the prevention and  resolution of conflicts and in peacebuilding and  reaffirmed their commitment to the full and effective  implementation of <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>.    Five years on, when we look back on the road we  have travelled and forward to the path ahead, we can  see that a great deal of work remains to be done in  attaining the goals defined in <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>.    First, we must strive to eliminate the root causes  of armed conflict and strengthen our conflict  prevention and early warning systems in order to create  an environment favourable to protecting <VIC>women</VIC> from  the harm that is caused by war. In other words, we  must cure the disease by addressing its root causes.    Secondly, crimes of sexual assault must be  punished more harshly; violence against <VIC>women</VIC> must  be more seriously investigated and <VIL>its perpetrators</VIL>  must be brought to justice. <HER>United Nations  peacekeeping operations</HER> must continue to pursue a  zero-tolerance policy to ensure strict compliance with  rules and adherence to standards.    Thirdly, <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> should be encouraged to  participate in peace processes at all stages. In  particular, it is essential to ensure that <HER_VIC>they</HER_VIC> have  decision-making power so that the special needs and  the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> will be reflected in conflict and  post-conflict processes. <HER_VIC>Women</HER_VIC> are both the primary  victims of armed conflicts of all kinds and  indispensable participants in the resolution of any  conflict. Their ardent yearning for peace enables <HER_VIC>them</HER_VIC>  to play a more important role in the promotion of peace  processes.    Fourthly, a summary should be prepared of  successful experiences in protecting <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>'s rights,  with a view to sharing and actively replicating them.  Efforts should be made to enhance awareness of the  need to protect <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>'s rights and to ensure that  words are translated into deeds.    Fifthly, work carried out on this issue by <HER>the  relevant bodies</HER> should be effectively coordinated. <HER>All  parties</HER> should be encouraged to take steps with the  strength born of collective action and to make every  effort to achieve the best possible outcome. <HER>Organs  such as the General Assembly and the Economic and  Social Council</HER> have been considering <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>'s issues  for many years and have rich experience to offer. <HER>The  Security Council</HER> should coordinate its activities with  theirs.    <HER_VIC>Women</HER_VIC> have played an important - indeed,  irreplaceable - role in the formation of human  civilization and the promotion of social development.  Progress for <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> is progress for all of humankind.  A popular Chinese saying has it that <HER>women</HER> hold up  half of the sky. We hope that, through our common  efforts, <VIC>mothers, wives and daughters</VIC> will no longer  shed their tears at the horrors of war and that all <VIC>our  sisters worldwide</VIC> will lead happy and peaceful lives.  We believe that our world will then be a brighter and  more beautiful place.",
    "UNSC_2010_SPV.6411_spch053.txt": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this annotation task. First, I need to read through the speech carefully and identify all the entities that fit the Hero, Villain, or Victim roles based on the guidelines provided.\n\nStarting with the speaker, Mr. Zidar from Slovenia. The initial part thanks Uganda for the initiative. According to the guidelines, entities like countries can be tagged if they are acting as Heroes. Since Uganda convened the debate, which is a proactive step, I'll tag Uganda as <HER>.\n\nNext, he thanks the Secretary-General, Under-Secretary-General Bachelet, and others. These are individuals and organizations contributing positively, so they should be Heroes. The phrase \"Secretary-General, Under-Secretary-General for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women Bachelet and other distinguished guests\" is a list sharing a common role, so the entire NP is tagged as <HER>.\n\nSlovenia aligns with the EU and Costa Rica's statements. The EU and Costa Rica (as part of the Human Security Network) are organizations promoting positive actions, so they get <HER> tags.\n\nResolution 1325 is mentioned. The guidelines say to tag UN Resolutions only if personified. In \"Resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security acknowledged that women are not just victims...\", the resolution is personified as acknowledging, so it's a Hero. But later in \"implementation of resolution 1325 (2000)\", it's not personified, so no tag.\n\nWomen are mentioned as victims in \"women are not just victims of armed conflict\". Here, \"victims\" is a generic term, so \"women\" would be Victim. But the sentence says they are not just victims, so maybe only \"victims\" is tagged as Victim. Wait, the example says if specific entities are mentioned, tag them. Here, \"women\" are the specific entity, so \"women\" as Victim? Wait, the example in guideline 5 says if \"victims\" is mentioned with a specific group, tag the group. But here, \"women are not just victims\" \u2013 \"victims\" is the generic term, so \"victims\" would be tagged as VIC. But the guidelines say not to tag predicate nominatives. Wait, guideline 1f: Do not annotate predicate nominatives. So in \"women are not only victims\", \"victims\" is a predicate nominative, so shouldn't be tagged. But in the example given, \"Women are not only victims\" would have \"Women\" as VIC. Wait, the example says: \"Women are not only victims.\u201d Here, victims should not be annotated. So in this case, \"women\" are the subject, but since they are described as victims in the predicate, we don't tag \"victims\" but if \"women\" are portrayed as victims elsewhere, we tag them. Wait, the example says: \u201c<VIC>Women</VIC> are not only victims.\u201d Here, victims should not be annotated. So in the given text, \"women are not just victims of armed conflict\", \"women\" are being described as victims, but since it's a predicate, we shouldn't tag \"victims\", but if \"women\" are the ones being portrayed as victims, maybe \"women\" should be tagged as VIC here. But according to the example, the predicate nominative isn't tagged. So in this case, \"women\" are the subject, and the statement is that they are not just victims. So perhaps \"women\" here are being portrayed as both victims and more. But according to guideline 5, if \"victims\" is a generic term and the specific entity is \"women\", then \"women\" should be tagged. However, in the example provided, \"Women are not only victims\" has \"Women\" as VIC. Wait, no: the example says: Example: \u201c<VIC>Women</VIC> are not only victims.\u201d Here, victims should not be annotated. So in that case, \"Women\" are tagged as VIC because they are the subject being described as victims, even though \"victims\" is the predicate. So applying that here, \"women are not just victims of armed conflict\" would have \"women\" as VIC. But the sentence is saying they are not just victims, implying they have other roles. So maybe \"women\" here are VIC. But the example shows that even if they are not only victims, the subject \"Women\" is tagged as VIC. So I'll tag \"women\" here as VIC.\n\nMoving on, in \"violence against women, especially sexual and gender-based violence, persists in conflicts.\" Here, \"women\" are victims of violence, so VIC. The violence itself is an abstract concept, so not tagged.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is mentioned as a place where women are targeted. The perpetrators here are not explicitly named, but the context refers to \"recent events\" where women are targets. Since the perpetrators are not specified, maybe the DRC isn't the villain, but the actors within it. Since the text says \"women continue to be deliberate targets of injustice and sexual violence in the conflict and its aftermath\", the villains would be the parties to the conflict, but they aren't named. So perhaps no villain tag here unless there's a specific entity. Since the DRC is a country but not portrayed as a villain, just the location, it's not tagged.\n\nThe Secretary-General's report is mentioned, and the Secretary-General is a Hero. The \"international community\" is mentioned as needing coordination, so \"international community\" as Hero.\n\nSlovenia supports the Secretary-General's recommendations, so \"Slovenia\" as Hero. The Security Council's decision to take forward indicators is a Hero action, so \"Security Council\" as Hero. Later, the Security Council is urged to impose measures, so again Hero.\n\nWhen discussing perpetrators of violations, \"perpetrators of violations of women's rights, including sexual violence\" would be Villains. So \"perpetrators\" is a generic term, but according to guideline 5, if specific entities are mentioned, tag them. Here, it's generic, so \"perpetrators\" would be VIL. However, the text says \"all parties to a conflict responsible for grave violations\", so \"parties to a conflict\" as VIL.\n\nIn the part about sexual violence being a priority in Council resolutions, the resolutions themselves are not personified, so no tag.\n\nSlovenia's national action plan: \"Slovenia\" is Hero. Gender equality in Slovenia's policies: \"Slovenia\" as Hero again. The security and defence sector activities: \"Slovenia\" as Hero.\n\nFinally, encouraging the Security Council to continue addressing the issue: \"Security Council\" as Hero. The \"United Nations\" and \"Member States\" as Heroes in the comprehensive approach.\n\nNow, checking for combined roles. Are there any entities that are both Hero and Victim? For example, women might be portrayed as both victims and agents of change. In the sentence \"their equal and full participation is vital\", women are participating, which could be Heroic. Earlier, they were victims. So in different parts, women might be both. But according to the guidelines, if in the same mention they have multiple roles, use combined tags. For example, in \"women's empowerment\", if empowerment implies they are victims needing help but also heroes contributing, then HER_VIC. In this speech, when women are mentioned as participants in decision-making, that's Heroic. When they are victims of violence, that's Victim. So each mention needs to be evaluated separately.\n\nIn \"promotion of the participation of women at the decision-making level\", \"women\" here are being empowered, so Hero. So tag as HER.\n\nIn \"violence against women, especially sexual and gender-based violence\", \"women\" are victims, so VIC.\n\nIn \"the empowerment and protection of women\", \"women\" are both being protected (VIC) and empowered (HER), so HER_VIC.\n\nWait, the example given was \"women\u2019s empowerment\" as HER_VIC. So here, \"empowerment and protection of women\" \u2013 empowerment implies Hero, protection implies Victim. So combined HER_VIC.\n\nSimilarly, in \"the plight of women in situations of armed conflict\", \"women\" are victims, so VIC.\n\nAnother point: \"the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and contribute to the empowerment and protection of women\". Here, \"women\" are both empowered (Hero) and protected (Victim), so HER_VIC.\n\nAlso, in the part where Slovenia is finalizing an action plan to empower and protect women, \"women\" would be HER_VIC.\n\nNow, checking for Villains. The perpetrators of sexual violence are villains. The text mentions \"parties to a conflict responsible for grave violations of women's rights, including sexual violence\". So \"parties to a conflict\" as VIL. Also, \"perpetrators of violations\" would be VIL.\n\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo example, the text says \"women continue to be deliberate targets of injustice and sexual violence in the conflict and its aftermath\". The perpetrators here are the conflicting parties, but they are not specifically named. So maybe \"parties to the conflict\" as VIL, but they aren't mentioned here. The text just states the fact that women are targeted, so the villains are implied but not named. Therefore, no tag here unless there's a specific entity mentioned.\n\nAnother possible villain is \"those responsible for grave violations\", which is later referred to as \"parties to a conflict\", so \"parties to a conflict\" as VIL.\n\nAlso, in the sanctions committees part, the Council should impose measures, but the villains are the parties, not the committees.\n\nNow, applying the tags step by step:\n\nOriginal text: \"Mr. Zidar (Slovenia): I would like to thank Uganda for the initiative to convene this important open debate on women, peace and security.\"\n\n- \"Uganda\" is a country taking initiative, so <HER>Uganda</HER>.\n- \"women\" here are part of the topic, not yet portrayed as victims or heroes. No tag yet.\n\nNext: \"I also thank the Secretary-General, Under-Secretary-General for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women Bachelet and other distinguished guests for their presentations today.\"\n\n- The list includes the Secretary-General, Bachelet, and guests. All are Heroes. The entire NP: <HER>the Secretary-General, Under-Secretary-General for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women Bachelet and other distinguished guests</HER>.\n\n\"Slovenia fully aligns itself with the statements to be delivered by the representative of the European Union and by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Human Security Network.\"\n\n- \"European Union\" and \"Costa Rica\" (as part of the Human Security Network) are organizations acting positively, so <HER>European Union</HER> and <HER>Costa Rica</HER>, and <HER>Human Security Network</HER>.\n\n\"Resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security acknowledged that women are not just victims of armed conflict...\"\n\n- \"Resolution 1325\" is personified as acknowledging, so <HER>Resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>.\n- \"women\" are described as victims here. Since it's a predicate, but according to the example, \"Women are not only victims\" would have \"Women\" as VIC. So here, \"women\" are tagged as <VIC>women</VIC>.\n\n\"In the past 10 years, many activities have been carried out to strengthen the role of women during and after conflict.\"\n\n- \"women\" here are having their role strengthened, which is Heroic. So <HER>women</HER>.\n\n\"However, this anniversary reminds us that despite those efforts, much needs to be done in the protection of women and in the promotion of the participation of women at the decision-making level, in conflict resolution and in peace processes.\"\n\n- \"protection of women\" \u2013 women as Victim, so <VIC>women</VIC>.\n- \"promotion of the participation of women\" \u2013 women as Hero, so <HER>women</HER>.\n\n\"Violence against women, especially sexual and gender-based violence, persists in conflicts.\"\n\n- \"women\" as victims of violence: <VIC>women</VIC>.\n\n\"Recent events in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have shown that women continue to be deliberate targets of injustice and sexual violence in the conflict and its aftermath.\"\n\n- \"women\" as victims: <VIC>women</VIC>.\n\n\"In his report (S/2010/498), the Secretary-General takes up United Nations activities in the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).\"\n\n- \"Secretary-General\" as Hero: <HER>Secretary-General</HER>.\n- \"United Nations\" as Hero: <HER>United Nations</HER>.\n\n\"The report shows that a vast range of activities has been carried out in the past 10 years. However, the fragmentation of those activities demonstrates the need to streamline and coordinate the action of all members of the international community.\"\n\n- \"international community\" as Hero: <HER>international community</HER>.\n\n\"Slovenia supports the Secretary-General's recommendation to develop a single comprehensive framework...\"\n\n- \"Slovenia\" as Hero: <HER>Slovenia</HER>.\n- \"Secretary-General\" again as Hero.\n\n\"We are of the opinion that the issue of women, peace and security needs to be addressed in a holistic and comprehensive manner.\"\n\n- \"women\" here are part of the issue, not specifically victims or heroes. No tag.\n\n\"We welcome the Security Council's decision to take forward the set of indicators developed by the Secretary-General to track the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) in situations of armed conflict as well as post-conflict and other situations.\"\n\n- \"Security Council\" as Hero: <HER>Security Council</HER>.\n\n\"Slovenia also supports the recommendation to establish a dedicated working group to review progress in the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and to make recommendations to the Security Council on how to address gaps and challenges to accelerate progress in the implementation of the resolution.\"\n\n- \"Slovenia\" as Hero: <HER>Slovenia</HER>.\n- \"Security Council\" as Hero: <HER>Security Council</HER>.\n\n\"Stronger steps should be taken to address accountability and to end impunity for perpetrators of violations.\"\n\n- \"perpetrators of violations\" as Villains: <VIL>perpetrators of violations</VIL>.\n\n\"The Security Council should impose targeted and graduated measures against all parties to a conflict responsible for grave violations of women's rights, including sexual violence.\"\n\n- \"parties to a conflict\" as Villains: <VIL>parties to a conflict</VIL>.\n- \"women's rights\" \u2013 \"women\" here are victims, but \"rights\" are abstract. Since \"women\" are mentioned in possessive, but according to guideline 1c, possessive modifiers are included. However, \"women's rights\" is an abstract concept, so not tagged. Wait, guideline 4a says abstract concepts like \"women's participation\" are not tagged. So \"women's rights\" is an abstract concept, so \"women\" here are not tagged.\n\n\"Sexual violence should be a priority element in all Council resolutions mandating the sanctions committees.\"\n\n- No entities to tag here.\n\n\"We all have a responsibility to implement resolution 1325 (2000). The development of national action plans is a key means by which Member States commit themselves to fulfilling that responsibility.\"\n\n- \"Member States\" as Heroes: <HER>Member States</HER>.\n\n\"I would like to report that Slovenia is about to finalize and adopt such an action plan.\"\n\n- \"Slovenia\" as Hero: <HER>Slovenia</HER>.\n\n\"The goal is to interconnect existing national and international activities addressing a broader concept of women, peace and security in order to translate them into genuine political commitments, and thus accelerate the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and contribute to the empowerment and protection of women.\"\n\n- \"empowerment and protection of women\": \"women\" here are both empowered (Hero) and protected (Victim), so <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>.\n\n\"In Slovenia, gender equality is a priority not only in the field of human rights and development cooperation but also in security and defence policy.\"\n\n- \"Slovenia\" as Hero: <HER>Slovenia</HER>.\n\n\"Since 2008, much has been done to promote gender equality in the security and defence sector. Those activities range from awareness-raising and training to the adoption and modification of legislation and other measures, including codes of conduct.\"\n\n- No entities to tag here.\n\n\"The recently adopted strategy on the participation of the Republic of Slovenia in international operations and missions promotes equal opportunities with regard to such efforts at all levels, irrespective of gender.\"\n\n- \"Republic of Slovenia\" as Hero: <HER>Republic of Slovenia</HER>.\n\n\"Lastly, let me take this opportunity to encourage the Security Council to continue to address the issue of women, peace and security and to seek the most effective means to improve the situation of women in armed conflict.\"\n\n- \"Security Council\" as Hero: <HER>Security Council</HER>.\n- \"women\" here are in a situation needing improvement, so Victim: <VIC>women</VIC>.\n\n\"With a comprehensive United Nations approach and increased ownership by Member States over their activities, the plight of women in situations of armed conflict and its aftermath can be eliminated.\"\n\n- \"United Nations\" as Hero: <HER>United Nations</HER>.\n- \"Member States\" as Hero: <HER>Member States</HER>.\n- \"plight of women\": \"women\" as Victim: <VIC>women</VIC>.\n\nNow, checking for any missed entities or incorrect tags. Also, ensuring that overlapping annotations are properly nested. For example, if a victim is mentioned within a villain entity, the tags should nest. But in this speech, there don't seem to be such cases.\n\nAlso, checking for combined roles. The empowerment and protection of women was tagged as HER_VIC. Other instances where women are both victims and heroes would need combined tags. For example, in \"contribute to the empowerment and protection of women\", \"women\" are both empowered (HER) and protected (VIC), so HER_VIC.\n\nAnother instance: \"the empowerment and protection of women\" \u2013 same as above.\n\nAlso, in the part where women's participation is promoted, that's Heroic. When they are victims of violence, that's Victim.\n\nI think that's all. Now, applying all these tags to the original text, making sure to preserve spacing and exact wording.\n</think>\n\nMr. Zidar (Slovenia): I would like to thank  <HER>Uganda</HER> for the initiative to convene this important  open debate on women, peace and security. I also thank  <HER>the Secretary-General, Under-Secretary-General for  Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women  Bachelet and other distinguished guests</HER> for their  presentations today.    <HER>Slovenia</HER> fully aligns itself with the statements to  be delivered by the representative of <HER>the European  Union</HER> and by the representative of <HER>Costa Rica</HER> on  behalf of <HER>the Human Security Network</HER>.    <HER>Resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> on women, peace and  security",
    "UNSC_2014_SPV.7289_spch006.txt": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to annotate this speech according to the guidelines provided. Let me start by reading through the speech carefully and identifying the entities that fit into Hero, Villain, or Victim roles based on how the speaker portrays them.\n\nFirst, the speaker is Mr. Beyani, but according to the guidelines, I shouldn't tag the speaker at the beginning if they're separated by a colon. So the first part \"Mr. Beyani:\" stays untagged.\n\nHe starts by thanking the Permanent Mission of Argentina and other Security Council members for holding the debate. The guidelines say to tag organizations if they're acting in a role. Since they're hosting a debate on displaced women and girls, which are victims, maybe the Permanent Mission of Argentina and Security Council members are Heroes. Let me check the role definitions. Hero includes entities that help victims or increase commitment to a cause. Yes, so \"<HER>the Permanent Mission of Argentina</HER> and <HER>the other members of the Security Council</HER>\".\n\nNext, he mentions \"displaced women and girls\" as part of the agenda. These are clearly victims, so \"<VIC>displaced women and girls</VIC>\".\n\nHe talks about the intersection of peace, security, human rights, and development. Those are abstract concepts, so not tagged. Then \"internally displaced women\" are mentioned as playing a role in negotiating peace. Since they're contributing positively, they might be both Victim and Hero. The guidelines say if they're victims but also taking action, use combined tags. So \"<HER_VIC>internally displaced women</HER_VIC>\".\n\nHe mentions his mandate, which involves dialogue with Governments and the international community. Governments and international community here are helping, so \"<HER>Governments</HER>\" and \"<HER>the international community</HER>\". \n\nField missions to Kenya, Azerbaijan, etc., are locations, but unless they're acting in a role, maybe not. The missions themselves are actions, not entities. The support from UN agencies like OHCHR, UNHCR, OCHA are organizations helping, so \"<HER>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights</HER>\", \"<HER>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</HER>\", and \"<HER>the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</HER>\".\n\nMember States supporting IDPs are Heroes: \"<HER>Member States</HER>\". The Arria Formula meeting co-chaired by Chile and Argentina, which he addressed, so \"<HER>Chile</HER>\" and \"<HER>Argentina</HER>\".\n\nHe mentions 33.3 million IDPs, which are victims: \"<VIC>33.3 million internally displaced persons</VIC>\". Women and girls as half the IDP population: \"<VIC>Women and girls</VIC>\".\n\nResolutions like 1325 (2000) are mentioned. The guidelines say to tag UN Resolutions only if personified. Here, it's part of policies, so not tagged. The Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement are mentioned but they're a document, not a personified entity. However, the General Assembly and Security Council resolutions that recognize them are organizations acting, so \"<HER>the General Assembly</HER>\" and \"<HER>Security Council</HER>\".\n\nInstruments like the Pact on Security and the African Union Kampala Convention are mentioned. The African Union is an organization, so \"<HER>the African Union</HER>\".\n\nThematic report to the Human Rights Council: \"<HER>the Human Rights Council</HER>\".\n\nWhen discussing violations during conflict, the perpetrators like armed groups aren't explicitly named here, but the text mentions \"armed conflict\" causing displacement. However, the speaker doesn't name specific villains, so maybe no Villain tags here. The victims are women and girls facing rape, torture, etc., so \"<VIC>women and girls</VIC>\".\n\nHe mentions IDPs facing challenges, so \"<VIC>IDPs</VIC>\". Double discrimination against displaced women: \"<VIC>internally displaced women</VIC>\".\n\nIn Cote d'Ivoire, IDPs in urban areas, girls impregnated during displacement: \"<VIC>girls</VIC>\". Vulnerable communities pushed to outskirts: \"<VIC>the most vulnerable communities, including women and girls</VIC>\".\n\nIn Sri Lanka, IDP women lacking documentation: \"<VIC>IDP women</VIC>\".\n\nStates lacking frameworks: \"<VIC>States</VIC>\" but wait, States here are entities that need to act. Since they're not fulfilling their role, maybe Villain? But the guidelines say Villain causes harm or disrupts peace. If the States are failing to protect, maybe they're Villains. But the speaker is advising States, so maybe they're not portrayed as villains but as needing to improve. Hmm, tricky. The text says \"States have neither policy frameworks...\", which could imply they're not acting, but the role might be passive. Maybe not tagged as Villain here.\n\nData collection disaggregated by sex: abstract concept, not tagged. \n\nPreventive approach to gender-based violence: engaging men and boys. The perpetrators are not specified here, so no Villain tags. \n\nIn Ukraine, IDP women volunteering: \"<HER_VIC>IDP women</HER_VIC>\".\n\nParticipation of IDP women in decision-making: \"<HER_VIC>IDP women and girls</HER_VIC>\".\n\nFinally, thanks Argentina again: \"<HER>Argentina</HER>\".\n\nI need to make sure all entities are tagged correctly, including nested tags where necessary. Also, check for combined roles when entities are both Hero and Victim. For example, \"internally displaced women\" are both victims and heroes when they contribute to peace. Use <HER_VIC> for those instances.\n\nAlso, check possessive cases like \"women's resilience\" \u2013 if \"women\" are mentioned specifically, tag as <VIC>women</VIC> if they're victims, but here \"women's resilience\" is an abstract concept, so maybe not tagged. Wait, the guidelines say not to tag abstract concepts. So \"women's resilience\" is abstract, so \"women's\" is part of the concept, so not tagged.\n\nAnother example: \"the 2009 African Union Kampala Convention\" \u2013 African Union is an organization, so \"<HER>the African Union</HER>\".\n\nMake sure not to tag \"peacekeeping personnel\" unless they're mentioned as perpetrators, which they aren't here. \n\nCheck for exact spacing and punctuation. The user emphasized keeping the original spacing, even if multiple spaces. So need to replicate the original text's spacing exactly, including any double spaces or line breaks.\n\nAlso, when entities are listed together in the same NP, tag the entire sequence. For example, \"Governments and the international community\" \u2013 if both are Heroes, tag as \"<HER>Governments and the international community</HER>\".\n\nWait, in the speech: \"I enter into dialogue with Governments and the international community alike to advise on and advocate for...\". Here, both Governments and international community are entities being advised, so they're Heroes. So \"<HER>Governments and the international community</HER>\".\n\nAnother part: \"the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\" \u2013 these are three separate entities but part of the same NP, so tag the entire list as one Hero: \"<HER>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</HER>\".\n\nAlso, \"Member States, both those working to cope with and to protect IDPs and those supporting action...\" \u2013 Member States are Heroes, so \"<HER>Member States</HER>\".\n\nIn the part about the Arria Formula meeting co-chaired by Chile and Argentina: \"<HER>Chile</HER> and <HER>Argentina</HER>\".\n\nWhen he says \"I was heartened by the resilience of IDP women I met in Ukraine. Many of them were volunteering to help other displaced persons.\" Here, IDP women are both victims and heroes, so \"<HER_VIC>IDP women</HER_VIC>\".\n\nAlso, \"the participation and leadership of IDP women in finding durable solutions\" \u2013 again, \"<HER_VIC>IDP women</HER_VIC>\".\n\nNeed to ensure that all instances of \"women and girls\", \"IDPs\", etc., are tagged correctly as Victims or combined roles where applicable.\n\nAvoid tagging abstract concepts like \"access to justice\", \"resilience\", etc.\n\nCheck for any mentions of Villains. The speech mainly focuses on victims and heroes, with perpetrators like armed groups not specifically named, so maybe no Villain tags. Except maybe in the part about \"armed conflict\" causing displacement, but the speaker doesn't name specific groups. The guidelines say to tag entities causing harm. If the text refers to \"armed conflict\" in general, it's an abstract concept, so not tagged. However, if there's a mention of specific groups like \"armed forces\" or others, but in this speech, it's more about the conditions rather than specific villains. So maybe no Villain tags here.\n\nWait, in the speech: \"during situations of conflict and violence, women and girls flee to escape arbitrary killings, rape, torture, inhumane or degrading treatment or starvation. They may have been the victims of such violations themselves or seen their loved ones attacked and abused. The experience of my mandate is that women and girls are targeted as a means of armed conflict - to destroy and humiliate communities, to manipulate the demographic composition of communities, for sexual slavery including enforced concubinage, and at times enforced sterilization.\"\n\nHere, the perpetrators are those conducting the armed conflict, but they're not named. Since the guidelines say to tag only specific entities (people, organizations, countries, groups), and since the speaker doesn't name them, perhaps no Villain tags here. The victims are the women and girls, so \"<VIC>women and girls</VIC>\".\n\nAnother part: \"displaced women often face double discrimination, based on being both an IDP and a woman\" \u2013 so \"<VIC>displaced women</VIC>\".\n\nIn the example about the women fetching firewood: \"If we let their husbands and male children fetch firewood, food or water, they will be killed, whereas we may be raped but spared death\". Here, \"they\" refers to husbands and male children, but they are not tagged unless they're victims. The women are saying they might be raped, so they are victims: \"<VIC>we</VIC>\".\n\nBut the original text has: \"They have told me, 'If we let their husbands and male children fetch firewood, food or water, they will be killed, whereas we may be raped but spared death'.\" So \"we\" refers to the women, so \"<VIC>we</VIC>\".\n\nBut the guidelines say to tag noun phrases. \"we\" is a pronoun, so needs to check if it's part of a noun phrase. The quote is: \"we may be raped...\", so \"we\" is a pronoun referring to the women. The guidelines say to tag entities, which include groups. Since \"we\" refers to the displaced women, who are already mentioned as victims, maybe tag \"<VIC>we</VIC>\".\n\nBut the example in the guidelines has \"they\" as victims when referring back. For example, in Annotated Example 1: \"deriving profits from <VIC>human beings</VIC> and considering <VIC>them</VIC> as merchandise\". So \"them\" is tagged as Victim. Therefore, in this case, \"we\" would be tagged as Victim: \"<VIC>we</VIC>\".\n\nSimilarly, \"they\" referring to IDPs: \"IDPs at greater risk\" would be \"<VIC>IDPs</VIC>\".\n\nAnother part: \"the perpetrators\" in \"holding perpetrators accountable\" \u2013 but \"perpetrators\" is a general term, not a specific entity, so not tagged unless specified.\n\nSo, compiling all these, the annotated speech should have tags for Heroes (HER), Victims (VIC), and combined roles where applicable. Since there are no specific villains named, maybe no VIL tags. But let me check again.\n\nWait, in the part about \"sexual and gender-based violence\", the perpetrators are implied but not named. Since the guidelines say to tag only specific entities, and since the speaker doesn't name them, no Villain tags here. \n\nTherefore, the final answer should include HER, VIC, and HER_VIC tags where appropriate, following the guidelines strictly.\n</think>\n\nMr. Beyani: I would like to thank <HER>the Permanent Mission of Argentina</HER> and <HER>the other members of the Security Council</HER> for holding this open debate on the critical issue of <VIC>displaced women and girls</VIC> in the framework of the women and peace and security agenda. The intersection of peace and security, human rights and development is critical to dealing with the issue of internal displacement. We must not lose sight of the important role that <HER_VIC>internally displaced women</HER_VIC> can play in negotiating peace, ensuring their human rights and bringing about development in post-conflict situations.    As part of my mandate, I enter into dialogue with <HER>Governments and the international community</HER> alike to advise on and advocate for the best possible protection of <VIC>internally displaced persons (IDPs)</VIC>, and in all my field missions I pay specific attention to the protection of <VIC>internally displaced women and girls</VIC>. This year alone, I have carried out missions to Kenya, Azerbaijan, Cote d'Ivoire, Haiti and Ukraine. Such field missions are significant in that they provide an early warning system for <HER>the international community</HER> through <HER>the Human Rights Council</HER>, <HER>the General Assembly</HER> and, in this instance, <HER>the Security Council</HER> itself on the actual causes, conditions and situations of displacement.    My mandate receives specific support from <HER>United Nations agencies and entities</HER>, in particular <HER>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights</HER>, <HER>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</HER> and <HER>the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</HER>, and I am grateful for their support and great collaboration. My work could not be possible without the outstanding support extended by <HER>Member States</HER>, both those working to cope with and to protect <VIC>IDPs</VIC> and those supporting action to improve the lives of <VIC>internally displaced persons</VIC> internationally. I am grateful for the ever-growing cooperation extended by States to my mandate. I would also like to highlight the Arria Formula meeting in May on the protection of <VIC>IDPs</VIC>, co-chaired by <HER>Chile</HER> and <HER>Argentina</HER>, which I had the privilege to address and during which the issue of internal displacement and threats to international peace and security were tackled.    We started 2014 with an unprecedented peak in the number of <VIC>persons forcibly displaced within their own countries</VIC> due to armed conflict, generalized Violence or human rights violations - <VIC>33.3 million internally displaced persons</VIC>, the highest figure ever recorded. In many countries, <VIC>IDPs</VIC> are also displaced by natural disasters, further compounding existing vulnerabilities. <VIC>Women and girls</VIC> account for some half of the world's <VIC>IDP</VIC> population.    Since the 1990s, greater attention has been paid to the rights and needs of <VIC>women and girls</VIC> in emergency and post-conflict situations and to promoting gender- sensitive approaches in humanitarian, development and early recovery response. A wide range of resolutions - for instance, the landmark resolution 1325 (2000) - but also policies, gender-mainstreaming efforts and targeted programmes have been adopted in this regard, and they have increasingly encompassed <VIC>internally displaced women and girls</VIC>.    The 1998 Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, which detail the specific rights of <VIC>internally displaced women and girls</VIC>, have been recognized by <HER>the General Assembly</HER> and in <HER>Security Council</HER> resolutions. The Guiding Principles have informed the inclusion of concrete and progressive provisions on <VIC>internally displaced women</VIC> in subsequent instruments, such as the 2006 Pact on Security, Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region and the 2009 <HER>African Union</HER> Kampala Convention for the Protection and Assistance of <VIC>Internally Displaced Persons</VIC> in Africa. In 2013, I dedicated my thematic report to <HER>the Human Rights Council</HER> to the situation of <VIC>internally displaced women</VIC>, and during this debate I would like to draw to the attention of <HER>the Security Council</HER> to that report.    Despite such positive developments, responses to internal displacement still do not adequately address the specific concerns and roles of <VIC>women and girls</VIC>. During situations of conflict and violence, <VIC>women and girls</VIC> flee to escape arbitrary killings, rape, torture, inhumane or degrading treatment or starvation. They may have been <VIC>the victims of such violations</VIC> themselves or seen <VIC>their loved ones</VIC> attacked and abused. The experience of my mandate is that <VIC>women and girls</VIC> are targeted as a means of armed conflict - to destroy and humiliate communities, to manipulate the demographic composition of communities, for sexual slavery including enforced concubinage, and at times enforced sterilization. As <VIC>IDPs</VIC>, <VIC>women</VIC> experience the various human rights challenges that are characteristic to displacement situations and that often place <VIC>IDPs</VIC> at greater risk than other affected populations. Such challenges include the loss of livelihoods and key documentation, as well as the lack of effective access to a number of important rights and services.    In addition, <VIC>internally displaced women</VIC> often face double discrimination, based on being both an <VIC>IDP</VIC> and a <VIC>woman</VIC>, and experience human rights challenges due to the intersection of gender with other factors such as age, group affiliation such as minority status, disability and civil or socioeconomic situations. <VIC>Displaced women</VIC> often have to assume new gender roles that further expose them to gender-based violence, including physical violence and trafficking. Those roles include being the only breadwinners and taking on the increased burden of care for extended families. <VIC>Internally displaced women</VIC> risk their lives, safety and physical integrity to protect <VIC>their husbands and families</VIC>. They have told me, \"If we let <VIC>their husbands and male children</VIC> fetch firewood, food or water, <VIC",
    "UNSC_2017_SPV.8079_spch078.txt": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this annotation task step by step. First, I need to read through the speech carefully and identify all the entities that fit the criteria: people, organizations, countries, groups, and UN Resolutions if they're personified.\n\nStarting with the speaker, Mr. Hilale from Morocco. The instructions say not to tag speakers at the beginning separated by a colon, so he's out. The first mention is \"my delegation\" which is a possessive noun phrase. According to guideline 1c, possessive modifiers are included. Since the delegation is thanking France for organizing the debate, France here is acting as a Hero because they're facilitating a discussion. So France would be <HER>.\n\nNext, resolution 1325 (2000) is mentioned. The example says to tag UN Resolutions if they're personified. In \"the historic adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) represented international recognition...\", the resolution isn't personified here; it's just being referenced. But later, when talking about implementing resolution 1325, it's still not personified. Wait, in the example, \"Resolution 1325 calls for action\" is tagged as Hero. Here, the resolution is recognized for its role, so maybe it's personified. Let me check. The text says \"the role played by women... as agents of change\" which the resolution recognized. The resolution itself is being credited with enabling that recognition, so maybe it's a Hero. But the example shows that when a resolution is mentioned in the context of implementation, it's not tagged. Hmm. The line says \"the provisions of resolution 1325 (2000)\" which is more about implementation, so maybe not tagged. But the initial adoption is about recognition, so perhaps that's personified. I'm a bit confused. Let me check the guidelines again. Guideline 3e says to tag UN Resolutions only if explicitly personified. The example given is \"Resolution 1325 calls for action\" where it's tagged. Here, the resolution is \"represented international recognition\", which is more of a passive role, not an active entity. So maybe not tagged. I'll skip tagging the resolution here.\n\nMoving on, \"UN-Women-led global study\" \u2013 UN-Women is an organization, so that's a Hero. \"Morocco organized an international conference\" \u2013 Morocco as a country is acting as a Hero here. The \"independent regional centre\" in Rabat created by Morocco would be an organization, so Hero. \"The Kingdom of Morocco\" is mentioned later, also Hero. \"UN-Women\" again when commended, so Hero. \n\nLooking for Victims: \"women and girls have special needs\" \u2013 they're in need of protection, so Victim. \"women are often underrepresented\" \u2013 excluded from decision-making, so Victim. \"women and girls\" again in post-conflict needs. \"they are not included\" \u2013 exclusion, so Victim. \n\nVillains: Are there any entities causing harm? The speech mainly focuses on positive actions and the needs of women, so maybe no Villains. The root causes of conflict mentioned in the 2030 Agenda part are abstract (poverty, etc.), which aren't tagged. \n\nCombined roles: When women are both agents of change (Hero) and victims. For example, \"women in peace and security, not only as victims but also as agents of change\" \u2013 here, women are both Victim and Hero. So \"women\" would be <HER_VIC>. Similarly, later mentions where women are underrepresented (Victim) but also contributing (Hero) might need combined tags. \n\nCheck for nested or overlapping annotations. For example, \"the role played by women in peace and security, not only as victims but also as agents of change\" \u2013 \"women\" here are both Victim and Hero, so <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>.\n\nAlso, \"the inclusion of women and gender equality\" \u2013 \"women\" here are being included, which is Heroic, but gender equality is an abstract concept. So only tag \"women\" as Hero if they're portrayed as active. Here, inclusion is a positive action, so Hero.\n\nNeed to ensure not to tag abstract concepts. \"gender equality\" is abstract, so not tagged. \"peace and security\" \u2013 abstract. \n\nCheck possessive cases: \"women's participation\" \u2013 \"women's\" is a possessive, so include as part of the NP. If participation is a concept, but the entity is women. Since participation is an abstract concept, but the guidelines say if the entity is specified, tag it. In \"women's participation\", the entity is women, so if they're portrayed as Hero/Victim. Here, participation in negotiations increases sustainability, so Hero. So \"<HER>women's</HER> participation\".\n\nWait, but in the example given, \"women\u2019s empowerment\" is tagged as HER_VIC because empowerment implies they need help (Victim) but also contribute (Hero). So \"women's participation\" here might be similar. Since participation is part of their role as agents of change, maybe just Hero. But in the example, when women are both victims and heroes, it's a combined tag. In the speech, women are mentioned as both victims and agents, so maybe combined. Let me check the specific context.\n\nOriginal line: \"not only as victims but also as agents of change\". So here, \"women\" are explicitly both. So the NP \"women\" should be <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>. Later mentions where they're underrepresented are Victim, but when they participate, Hero. So each mention needs to be evaluated.\n\nAnother example: \"the presence of women in peace negotiations promoted the sustainability\" \u2013 here, women are Heroes. So \"<HER>women</HER>\".\n\nBut when it's \"women are often underrepresented\", that's Victim. So each instance depends on context.\n\nAlso, \"the inclusion of women\" \u2013 inclusion is a positive action, so Hero.\n\nNow, applying the tags:\n\n- \"my delegation\" \u2192 possessive, Hero.\n- \"France\" organizing debate \u2192 Hero.\n- \"Morocco organized\" \u2192 Hero.\n- \"UN-Women-led global study\" \u2192 Hero.\n- \"Morocco\" creating a center \u2192 Hero.\n- \"the Kingdom of Morocco\" \u2192 Hero.\n- \"UN-Women\" commended \u2192 Hero.\n- \"women\" as victims and agents \u2192 HER_VIC.\n- \"women and girls\" with special needs \u2192 Victim.\n- \"women are often underrepresented\" \u2192 Victim.\n- \"they are not included\" \u2192 Victim.\n- \"women and men share resources\" \u2013 both, but here it's about equality, so maybe not tagged unless one is a victim. Since it's about equitable development, maybe women as Victim needing inclusion. But the sentence is about sharing, so perhaps not. Wait, the guideline says Victims are excluded from decision-making. Here, \"ensure that... women and men share... decision-making and power.\" So women are included, which is Heroic? Or previously they were excluded, now being included. The sentence is about the approach to ensure inclusion, so maybe women here are being portrayed as needing inclusion (Victim) but also as part of the solution (Hero). So combined HER_VIC. Hmm, but the sentence itself is stating the goal, so maybe women are still Victims here because the approach is needed to include them. So just Victim.\n\nThis is tricky. Each mention needs careful consideration based on the role definitions.\n\nAlso, \"peacekeeping personnel\" in other examples are sometimes Villains if they commit crimes, but here, there's no mention of negative actions by them.\n\nI think I've covered most entities. Now, applying the tags without missing any, keeping original spacing and spelling.\n</think>\n\nMr. Hilale (Morocco) (spoke in French): First of all,  <HER>my delegation</HER> would like to thank <HER>France</HER> for organizing  this open debate during its presidency of the Security  Council, on an issue that is of the utmost importance to  <HER>Morocco</HER> - <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and peace and security.    The historic adoption of resolution 1325 (2000)  represented international recognition of the role  played by <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peace and security, not only as  victims but also as agents of change and essential  players in restoring, maintaining and consolidating  peace. Maintaining peace and security requires the  integration of the gender perspective into all peace  efforts, in accordance with the provisions of resolution  1325 (2000) and the other resolutions that followed in  that regard.    <HER>Women</HER>'s participation in negotiation processes  increases the chances of settling conflicts and  sustaining peace. That finding was confirmed by a <HER>UN-  Women</HER>-led global study in 2015, which revealed that  the presence of <HER>women</HER> in peace negotiations promoted  the sustainability of peace agreements, and that 35 per  cent of agreements negotiated by <HER>women</HER> lasted more  than 15 years. That means that the presence of <HER>women</HER> in  peace negotiations is a great help for the sustainability  ofpeace agreements.    On 7 September, 2016, <HER>Morocco</HER> organized an  international conference on the topic of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and  peace and security. It contributed to the international  debate on the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peace processes and  the implementation of national plans of action to  promote collective action on implementing resolution  1325 (2000). It was an occasion to reaffirm the  international community's consensus on the need to  strengthen <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>'s participation in negotiations and  agreements concerning the settlement of conflicts and  peacebuilding, as well as to renew the United Nations  commitment to the issue of the inclusion of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>  and gender equality in all peacebuilding and conflict-  prevention strategies.    During the conference, debates focused on  three areas: the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in mediation and  conflict-prevention processes, the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in  deradicalization and the lessons learned and best  practices in the prevention of sexual violence in  conflict. At the conference, <HER>my country</HER> announced the  creation in Rabat of an independent regional centre, a  think-tank, dedicated to studying the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in  peacekeeping operations and their contribution to the  achievement of sustainable development. The centre  could serve as a space for reflection, a think-tank and  a source of independent thought regarding the role and  place of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peacekeeping and peacebuilding  operations in conflict zones. It is in keeping with the  priorities ofthe Security Council in promoting <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>'s  empowerment and gender equality in the establishment  of peace and international security, the dissemination  of the culture of peace, ensuring access to justice and  the protection of civil rights.    <VIC>Women and girls</VIC> have special needs in the post-  conflict period, such as health services, livelihood,  land rights and property rights and employment.  <HER_VIC>They</HER_VIC> must also participate in decision-making and  the development of national strategies for post-  conflict economic recovery. Unfortunately, <VIC>women</VIC>  are often underrepresented in the decision-making  process associated with economic recovery and public  governance in the post-conflict phase. <VIC>They</VIC> are  not included in formal decision-making structures,  including key economic sectors, such as infrastructure,  extractive industries and commercial agriculture.  To that end, the preparation of an approach based on  gender and development in a post-conflict context is  imperative in order to ensure that, from the beginning  of the reconstruction process, there is sustainable  and equitable development where both <VIC>women</VIC> and  men share resources, opportunities, decision-making  and power.    In that context, <HER>the Kingdom of Morocco</HER> takes  this opportunity to commend the work of <HER>UN-Women</HER>  to promote the implementation of the Security  Council resolutions on <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and peace and security,  particularly with regard to economic recovery and  reconstruction through the three areas of intervention:  post-conflict planning, economic recovery and  governance restoration.    The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development  has placed great emphasis on peace, including the  prevention of conflict and the elimination of its root  causes through Sustainable Development Goal 16,  which seeks to promote peaceful and inclusive societies  for sustainable development, provide access to justice  for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive  institutions at all levels.  The universal 2030 Agenda, which advocates a  cross-cutting incorporation of gender in all Sustainable  Development Goals, emphasizes the need to redouble  efforts to prevent conflict and help countries emerging  from conflict, while ensuring that <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> are involved  in peacekeeping and reconstruction. In that sense,  the Goals demonstrate that gender, peace, security  and development are interconnected, interrelated and  inseparable from one another."
