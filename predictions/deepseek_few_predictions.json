    "UNSC_2004_SPV.5066Resumption1_spch026.txt": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this annotation task. First, I need to understand the guidelines thoroughly. The goal is to tag entities in the speech as Hero, Villain, Victim, or combinations. The tags must be inline, preserving the original text's spacing and structure.\n\nStarting with the speaker: Mr. Kau from Fiji. The speech begins with thanks to the President and the Secretary-General. According to the guidelines, I shouldn't tag the speaker at the beginning separated by a colon. So \"Mr. President\" here is being thanked, which is a passive action. But in example 2, \"you, Mr. President\" was tagged as Hero. Wait, in example 2, the speaker congratulated the President and tagged him as Hero. Here, the speaker thanks the President. The guidelines say entities hoping for/welcoming/thanking are passive and not tagged. Wait, no\u2014the guidelines under \"Entities NOT to tag\" part 4b: \"Entities hoping for/welcoming/thanking/commending something good. These are passive actions.\" So thanking someone doesn't automatically make them a Hero. But in example 2, \"you, Mr. President\" was tagged as Hero because the speaker was congratulating them for their initiative. So maybe the action of organizing the debate is active, making the President a Hero here. Let me check the role definitions. Hero includes entities that make a call to action or recognize injustice. The President organized the debate, which could be seen as a call to action. So \"Mr. President\" might be Hero. But in the input speech, the first line is \"We would like to thank you, Mr. President, for having organized today's debate...\" So organizing the debate is a positive action, so Hero. So tag \"<HER>you, Mr. President</HER>\".\n\nNext, the Secretary-General's report. The speaker thanks the Secretary-General for his report. The report shows positive developments. The Secretary-General is an organization leader, so if his actions are helping, he's a Hero. So \"<HER>the Secretary-General</HER>\".\n\nResolution 1325 (2000) is mentioned. The guidelines say to tag UN Resolutions only if personified. In the example, \"Resolution 1325 calls for action\" is tagged as Hero. Here, the speech refers to \"the full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000)\". Since it's about implementation, not personified, so not tagged. Later, \"the full implementation of the resolution will continue to be a challenge...\" Again, not personified. So no tag here.\n\nFiji attaches importance to the subject and commends efforts by Security Council, General Assembly, etc. These are organizations. The speaker's own country, Fiji, is mentioned as attaching importance. The guidelines say to tag countries. But when the speaker refers to their own delegation or government, like \"Fiji attaches great importance...\"\u2014this is a country acting as a Hero by commending efforts. So \"<HER>Fiji</HER>\".\n\n\"We commend the efforts made thus far by the Security Council, the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council...\" These are all organizations contributing positively, so Heroes. Each should be tagged. But the guideline 1d says if multiple entities in the same NP sharing a role, tag the entire sequence. So \"<HER>the Security Council, the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and its functional commissions and other United Nations bodies and entities</HER>\".\n\nThen commends UNIFEM, regional organizations, Commonwealth Secretariat. These are organizations active in Fiji, so Heroes. \"<HER>the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM)</HER>\", \"<HER>regional organizations and other bodies, including the Commonwealth Secretariat</HER>\".\n\n\"Our Ministry for Women...\" is a government body working on gender mainstreaming. The ministry is part of Fiji's government, which is a Hero. So \"<HER>Our Ministry for Women, Social Welfare and Poverty Alleviation</HER>\".\n\nUNIFEM's support is mentioned again. Tag as Hero. \"the sponsorship and support of <HER>UNIFEM</HER>. and other actors, including civil society.\" Wait, the original text has \"UNIFEM. and other actors\"\u2014probably a typo with a period. Need to preserve that. So \"<HER>UNIFEM</HER>. and other actors\".\n\n\"Recent political upheavals... brought out the best in our women, their contribution... strong factor for good... effective stabilizers and mediators...\" Women here are portrayed as Heroes (mediators, contributors to peace) and possibly Victims if they were affected by upheavals. But the text emphasizes their positive role. So \"<HER>our women</HER>\", \"<HER>they</HER> have been effective stabilizers\", \"<HER>women and children</HER> playing key roles\".\n\nIn peacekeeping, Fiji is a contributor, so \"<HER>Fiji</HER>\". \"expansion of women's role in peacekeeping\" \u2013 women as Hero. \"women's role\" is a possessive, so include the modifier: \"<HER>women's</HER> role\".\n\n\"recent deployments have seen the successful integration of women...\" \u2013 women as Hero. \"<HER>women</HER>\".\n\n\"Fiji peacekeeping deployment to Iraq will include six women...\" \u2013 the women are Heroes contributing. \"<HER>six women</HER>\".\n\n\"We fully agree with the Secretary-General...\" \u2013 Secretary-General again as Hero. \"<HER>the Secretary-General</HER>\".\n\n\"Gender mainstreaming... training and capacity-building must target girls and women, but also boys and men...\" Girls and women as Victims (need capacity building) and Heroes (being trained to contribute). But the context is about empowering them, so maybe Hero and Victim. However, the sentence says \"target not only girls and women, but also boys and men\". The targeting here is for training, which is a positive action. Are girls and women here Victims because they need training? Or Heroes because they're being empowered? The example given in guidelines had \"women\u2019s empowerment\" as HER_VIC. Here, targeting them for training could be seen as both empowering (Hero) and addressing a need (Victim). So \"<HER_VIC>girls and women</HER_VIC>\", but \"boys and men\" are just targeted, not necessarily Victims. Wait, the guideline says not to tag predicate nominatives. Here, \"target\" is a verb, so \"girls and women\" are the direct object. Since they're being targeted for capacity-building, which is helping them, they could be Heroes. But if the need arises from a lack, maybe Victim. It's ambiguous. The example with \"women's empowerment\" was HER_VIC. So maybe here, \"girls and women\" are both Hero and Victim. So \"<HER_VIC>girls and women</HER_VIC>\".\n\n\"The Government, through... Ministry for Women... UNIFEM-sponsored Women and Peace and Security Committee...\" Government and Ministry as Heroes. \"<HER>The Government</HER>\", \"<HER>its Ministry for Women</HER>\", \"<HER>the UNIFEM-sponsored Women and Peace and Security Committee</HER>\".\n\n\"more effective coordination and partnerships... developing countries... enhanced cooperation...\" Not entities to tag here. \"We welcome the call by the Secretary-General...\" Again, Secretary-General as Hero. \"<HER>the Secretary-General</HER>\".\n\n\"good work done by UNIFEM. and other United Nations bodies...\" Tag UNIFEM and others as Heroes. \"<HER>UNIFEM</HER>. and other United Nations bodies, together with regional organizations such as the Pacific Islands Forum and the Commonwealth Secretariat</HER>\".\n\n\"indigenous women in conflict resolution as mediators...\" Indigenous women as Heroes. \"<HER>indigenous women</HER>\".\n\n\"Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women\" \u2013 a law/treaty, not tagged. \"Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action\" \u2013 same, not tagged.\n\n\"Fiji has a total population... women making up almost half...\" Women as potential Heroes. \"women have played the prominent role...\" So \"<HER>women</HER>\".\n\n\"Our support for the efforts of the Security Council and the Secretary-General...\" Security Council and Secretary-General as Heroes. \"<HER>the Security Council</HER>\", \"<HER>the Secretary-General</HER>\".\n\n\"women's participation in peace and security\" \u2013 women's participation is an abstract concept, but \"women\" here are the entity. Since participation is a concept, but \"women\" are the ones participating. The example had \"women's participation\" not tagged, but \"women as agents of peace\" where \"women\" were tagged. Here, \"women's participation\" is similar to the example where \"participation\" is abstract, so maybe not tag. Wait, the guidelines say under 4a: \"women\u2019s participation\" is an abstract concept, so \"women\" in that case are not tagged. But in the example, \"women as agents of peace\" were tagged as Hero. So here, \"women's participation\" is abstract, so \"women's\" is part of the concept and not tagged. But in the speech, \"women have played the prominent role\" \u2013 that's a direct action, so tagged as Hero.\n\nSo putting it all together, making sure to apply the tags correctly without overlapping errors and preserving original spacing and typos like \"UNIFEM. and other actors\".\n</think>\n\nMr. Kau (Fiji): We would like to thank <HER>you,  Mr. President</HER>, for having organized today's debate on  this issue. We also congratulate <HER>the Secretary-General</HER>  for his timely report on the follow-up to the full  implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) on women  and peace and security (S/2004/814).    While <HER>the Secretary-General</HER>'s report shows that  there have been positive developments in the  implementation of the resolution, further concerted  efforts are needed to ensure that the issue of  implementation is fully addressed. The full  implementation of the resolution will continue to be a  challenge for <HER>the Security Council</HER> and for <HER>the United  Nations</HER>.  <HER>Fiji</HER> attaches great importance to this subject, and  we commend the efforts made thus far by <HER>the Security  Council, the General Assembly, the Economic and  Social Council and its functional commissions and  other United Nations bodies and entities</HER>. We  commend, in particular, the efforts made by <HER>the United  Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM)</HER> and  by <HER>regional organizations and other bodies, including  the Commonwealth Secretariat</HER>, which have been active  partners in following up this issue in Fiji. <HER>Our Ministry  for Women, Social Welfare and Poverty Alleviation</HER> has  been the focal point of efforts to mainstream gender  perspectives in relation to critical peace and security  components in Government and other areas.    The necessary groundwork for the launching in  Fiji of national policies and strategies pursuant to  resolution 1325 (2000) has been greatly boosted by the  sponsorship and support of <HER>UNIFEM</HER>. and other actors,  including civil society. Work on mainstreaming gender  perspectives in relation to conflict prevention,  peacekeeping operations, humanitarian assistance and  post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation is in  progress.    Recent political and internal upheavals in our  country have brought out the best in <HER>our women</HER>, and  their contribution has been a strong factor for good and  steady progress. <HER>They</HER> have been effective stabilizers  and mediators in conflict prevention and very active  players in recent efforts in post-conflict peace-building  and reconciliation processes. A week-long peace and  reconciliation process with the objective, inter alia, of  uniting our polarized and divided country, which was  held last month, saw <HER>women and children</HER> playing key  roles. This was preceded by a national workshop on  conflict prevention and early warning.    In peacekeeping, <HER>Fiji</HER>, which is a staunch  supporter of and consistent contributor to international  peacekeeping missions, has introduced specific  measures to ensure the expansion of <HER>women's</HER> role in  peacekeeping. Despite the difficulties in overcoming  cultural and traditional barriers, recent deployments  have seen the successful integration of <HER>women</HER> into  various specialized duties, including guard duty. <HER>The  military and police departments, together with other  relevant bodies</HER>, are working on coherent strategies for  gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping. <HER>The Fiji  peacekeeping deployment to Iraq</HER> will include <HER>six  women</HER> who have been given specific training in  searching and in counselling. That also illustrates our  view that <HER>women</HER> can be as good as men in all areas if  given the opportunity.  We fully agree with <HER>the Secretary-General</HER> that  more effort must be put into capacity-building and  training. Gender mainstreaming in relation to all facets  of peace and security requires knowledge and  information-sharing. Training and capacity-building  must target not only <HER_VIC>girls and women</HER_VIC>, but also boys  and men at all levels of government and the  community. It should be all-encompassing and  comprehensive, targeting both the formal and the non-  formal sectors. Its inclusion in the education  curriculum will ensure early intervention and sustained  impact. <HER>The Government</HER>, through the programmes of  <HER>its Ministry for Women</HER> and through <HER>the UNIFEM-  sponsored Women and Peace and Security Committee</HER>,  is addressing the issue with all relevant stakeholders.    In addition, there is a need for more effective  coordination and partnerships. There is certainly no  lack of will and enthusiasm at the national level,  particularly in developing countries, but enhanced  cooperation and partnership are vital to ensure the  inflow of the resources and expertise which are  generally lacking in our countries. We therefore  welcome the call by <HER>the Secretary-General</HER> for the  development and strengthening of cooperation and  effective partnerships at all levels. We acknowledge the  good work done by <HER>UNIFEM</HER>. and other <HER>United Nations  bodies, together with regional organizations such as the  Pacific Islands Forum and the Commonwealth  Secretariat</HER>, in the Pacific region, including in Fiji. We  can only hope for more such cooperation and  partnerships.    We also commend <HER>the Secretary-General</HER> for his  recognition of the role of <HER>indigenous women</HER> in conflict  resolution as mediators and peace-builders. <HER>Indigenous  and local women</HER> have a strong advocacy role, and it  should be utilized in all aspects of security and peace.    There is a need to ensure that national and  international efforts for the implementation of  resolution 1325 (2000) are undertaken in a  comprehensive manner in the context of the  Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of  Discrimination against Women and the Beijing  Declaration and Platform for Action. To ensure  complementarity and proper coordination, every effort  must be undertaken in collaboration with, and within,  existing institutional arrangements.    <HER>Fiji</HER> has a total population of approximately  800,000, with women making up almost half of that  number. Given our small population, it was easy for us  to recognize the great potential that <HER>women</HER> represent.  In order to make progress, we had to harness all the  resources at our disposal, and <HER>women</HER> have played the  prominent role we expected - and more - in the  measured forward momentum towards our  developmental goals. Our support for the efforts of <HER>the  Security Council</HER> and <HER>the Secretary-General</HER> in the  furtherance of <HER>women</HER>'s participation in peace and  security is therefore absolute.",
    "UNSC_2009_SPV.6195_spch008.txt": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this annotation task step by step. First, I need to understand the guidelines thoroughly. The goal is to label entities in the speech as Hero, Villain, Victim, or combinations, using precise tags. The key points are:\n\n1. **Character Level Rules**: Annotate entire noun phrases, including modifiers and possessive cases. Avoid splitting lists if they share the same role. Don't include punctuation at the end. Don't tag abstract concepts or positions unless they're personified.\n\n2. **Role Definitions**:\n   - **Hero**: Helps victims, fights villains, calls to action.\n   - **Victim**: Suffers harm, needs protection.\n   - **Villain**: Causes harm, disrupts peace.\n\n3. **Entities to Tag**: People, organizations, countries, groups, UN resolutions (if personified).\n\n4. **Avoid Tagging**: Abstract concepts, laws, speakers at the beginning.\n\nStarting with the speech by Mr. Heller from Mexico. Let's go through each paragraph.\n\nFirst paragraph: He thanks Ban Ki-moon, welcomes ministers from Burkina Faso and France. According to the guidelines, speakers at the beginning (before the colon) shouldn't be tagged. \"Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\" is a person, so he's a Hero for his role. The ministers are also Heroes as they're being welcomed for their roles. So tag them as <HER>.\n\nNext, he addresses the Madam Secretary of State, acknowledging her leadership. She's a Hero. The delegation of the United States led negotiations on resolution 1888, which is a Hero action. Resolution 1888 is mentioned as being adopted; since it's a UN resolution and personified (\"reaffirmed commitment\"), it should be tagged as Hero.\n\nThe international community is resolved to protect women and children\u2014here, \"women and children\" are Victims. \"Armed conflicts\" are abstract, so not tagged. The visit to African countries, specifically the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which is a country. The DRC is mentioned as a place where crimes occurred, but the country itself isn't a Villain. The parties to the armed conflict are the Villains as they're responsible for the violence. \"Women and children\" again as Victims.\n\nThe establishment of the post of Special Representative is an abstract position unless it's personified. The resolution mentions the mandate, which is part of the UN, so the Special Representative's role is Hero. The UN mechanisms and agencies are Heroes. Resolutions 1888 and 1882 are mentioned in the context of their objectives; since they're being personified (working in a coordinated manner), they should be Heroes. The Security Council is taking action, so Hero. The General Assembly resolution 63/311 is a law/treaty, so not tagged.\n\nNational capacities of States are being improved\u2014States here are Heroes as they're working to bring perpetrators to justice. The multidisciplinary team of experts under the UN is a Hero. The perpetrators are Villains. \"Victims' needs\" refers to Victims. The challenge is using existing tools (Heroes) to prevent violence. \"Women and children\" as Victims again.\n\nNeed to check for combined roles. For example, if an entity is both Hero and Victim. In this speech, women and children are consistently Victims. The international community, UN entities, and specific countries are Heroes. The perpetrators and parties to conflict are Villains.\n\nMake sure not to tag abstract concepts like \"sexual violence\" or \"impunity.\" Also, check possessive cases: \"victims' needs\" is a possessive, so \"victims\" here would be tagged as Victim.\n\nNow, applying the tags:\n\n- \"Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\" \u2192 <HER>\n- \"Mr. Bedouma Alain Yoda, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Burkina Faso\" \u2192 <HER>\n- \"Mr. Alain Joyandet, Minister of State for Cooperation and Francophonie of France\" \u2192 <HER>\n- \"Madam Secretary of State\" \u2192 <HER>\n- \"delegation of the United States\" \u2192 <HER>\n- \"resolution 1888 (2009)\" \u2192 <HER> (personified as it's adopted and reaffirms commitment)\n- \"international community\" \u2192 <HER>\n- \"women and children\" \u2192 <VIC>\n- \"Democratic Republic of the Congo\" \u2192 Not tagged as it's a location, not a character.\n- \"parties to an armed conflict\" \u2192 <VIL>\n- \"Special Representative of the Secretary-General on sexual violence in situations of armed conflict\" \u2192 <HER>\n- \"United Nations mechanisms and agencies\" \u2192 <HER>\n- \"resolution 1882 (2009)\" \u2192 <HER>\n- \"Security Council\" \u2192 <HER>\n- \"General Assembly resolution 63/311\" \u2192 Not tagged (law/treaty)\n- \"States\" (those addressing conflicts) \u2192 <HER>\n- \"multidisciplinary team of experts\" \u2192 <HER>\n- \"perpetrators of such crimes\" \u2192 <VIL>\n- \"victims\" \u2192 <VIC>\n- \"women and children\" \u2192 <VIC>\n\nCheck for overlapping or nested tags. For example, in \"parties to an armed conflict to respect... women and children\", \"parties\" are Villains, and \"women and children\" are Victims nested within. But in the text, it's \"parties to an armed conflict\" as VIL and \"women and children\" as VIC separately. No overlap in the same phrase here.\n\nAlso, ensure that possessive cases are included: \"victims' needs\" \u2192 <VIC>victims</VIC>' needs.\n\nFinally, maintain exact spacing and punctuation as in the original. The user emphasized strict adherence to original formatting, including spaces and line breaks.\n</think>\n\nMr. Heller (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): I would  like to thank <HER>Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</HER> for    joining us at this important meeting of the Security  Council. We would also like to welcome to the Council  Chamber <HER>Mr. Bedouma Alain Yoda, Minister for  Foreign Affairs of Burkina Faso</HER>, and <HER>Mr. Alain  Joyandet, Minister of State for Cooperation and  Francophonie of France</HER>.    I would like in particular to welcome you,  <HER>Madam Secretary of State</HER>, and to acknowledge your  personal commitment and leadership, which have  created renewed impetus for the issue of the protection  of <VIC>women's</VIC> rights and the prevention of all forms of  violence against <VIC>women</VIC>. <HER>My delegation</HER> would also  like to thank <HER>the delegation of the United States</HER> for  leading negotiations on <HER>resolution 1888 (2009)</HER>, which  has just been adopted.    With the unanimous adoption of that resolution,  <HER>the Security Council</HER> has reaffirmed its commitment to  the protection of <VIC>women</VIC> in armed conflict. The  significant number of delegations that joined in  sponsoring this initiative shows that <HER>the international  community</HER> is resolved to ensure that <VIC>women and  children</VIC> no longer remain the principal victims of the  armed conflicts which, deplorably, are occurring in  many parts of the world.    Council members were able to see for ourselves  the gravity of the acts of sexual violence against  <VIC>women and children</VIC> in areas of armed conflict in the  course of our visit to a number of African countries last  May, in particular the Democratic Republic of the  Congo. On that occasion we witnessed the  consequences of these crimes for societies and their  negative impact on efforts to find solutions to crisis  situations and promote an effective process of national  reconciliation. For that reason we wish to reiterate, as  does <HER>resolution 1888 (2009)</HER>, the primary obligation of  all <VIL>parties to an armed conflict</VIL> to respect and to  enforce at all times international humanitarian law,  which grants special protection to <VIC>women and children</VIC>.    <HER>My delegation</HER> believes that the establishment of  the post of <HER>Special Representative of the Secretary-  General on sexual violence in situations of armed  conflict</HER> will make it possible to improve the systematic  and comprehensive attention that <HER>the United Nations</HER>  pays in response to sexual violence in these situations.    This new mandate should work in a coordinated  manner with other <HER>United Nations mechanisms and  agencies</HER> in order to harness synergies and to prevent  duplication. In particular, there is a broad relationship    between the objectives of <HER>resolution 1888 (2009)</HER> and  <HER>resolution 1882 (2009)</HER>, on <VIC>children</VIC> and armed conflict,  which was adopted by <HER>the Security Council</HER> last  August.    These common objectives must be duly explored  with a view to providing comprehensive protection for  all those who, due to their condition, suffer most from  the consequences of armed conflict, that is, <VIC>women and  children</VIC>. In the light of the aforementioned, we believe  that <HER>the Security Council</HER> must also pay close attention  to the ongoing negotiations on a composite gender  entity within the framework of <HER>the General Assembly</HER>  and decide to review the mandate of the <HER>Special  Representative</HER> in a reasonable period of time and in  the light of the results of the procedure outlined in  General Assembly resolution 63/311.    While more can be done at the international level  in order to prevent sexual violence in situations of  armed conflict, the eradication of sexual violence will  only be achieved if national capacities among those  <HER>States</HER> that are addressing situations of conflict are  improved with a view to bringing <VIL>the perpetrators of  such crimes</VIL> to justice.    Therefore, one of the most relevant aspects of the  resolution is the identification within <HER>the United  Nations</HER> of a <HER>multidisciplinary team of experts</HER> who,  when their assistance is required and with the consent  of the <HER>State</HER> concerned, can be deployed to the field in  order to work jointly with <HER>the Government</HER> and <HER>the  United Nations system</HER> to undertake projects for  technical cooperation to strengthen the rule of law,  prevent impunity and address <VIC>victims'</VIC> needs.    It is clear that currently we have strong tools for  preventing sexual violence in areas of conflict. The  true challenge that we face is making full use of this  array of instruments, if we truly wish to ensure that  more <VIC>women and children</VIC> do not fall victim to the  spiral of violence that is caused by armed conflict.",
    "UNSC_2011_SPV.6642_spch055.txt": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this annotation task step by step. First, I need to carefully read through the speech by Mr. Diallo from Senegal and identify all the entities that fit the Hero, Villain, or Victim roles based on the guidelines provided.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the speaker addresses the President and thanks several individuals and organizations. According to the guidelines, entities like the Secretary-General, Mr. Lazarous Kapambwe, Ms. Michelle Bachelet, and Ms. Orzala Ashraf Nemat should be considered. Since they are being thanked for their contributions, they're likely Heroes. The guidelines mention that thanking someone is a passive action and shouldn't be tagged, but in example 1, similar entities like the Secretary-General were tagged as Heroes. Wait, the guidelines say in section 4b: \"Entities hoping for/welcoming/thanking/commending something good. These are passive actions.\" So maybe I shouldn't tag them? But in the first example, the Secretary-General was tagged even when thanked. Hmm, maybe because they are recognized for their active roles. Let me check the example again. In example 1, \"the Secretary-General... for their briefings\" was tagged as Hero. So even though they're being thanked, they are considered Heroes because they are entities contributing positively. So I should tag them as Heroes here as well.\n\nNext, the speaker mentions resolution 1325 (2000) and other resolutions. According to guideline 3e, UN Resolutions should only be tagged if personified. The example given is \"Resolution 1325 calls for action\" would be a Hero. In the speech, it says \"resolution 1325 (2000) represented an enormous step forward...\" Here, the resolution is being credited with contributing to protection, so it's personified. So tag as Hero. Similarly, resolutions 1820, 1888, 1889 are mentioned in the same context, so they should also be Heroes.\n\nThen, \"thousands of women and girls\" are mentioned as being exposed to abuse. These are Victims. The phrase \"women and girls\" is a group that's suffering, so tag as VIC. Later, \"vulnerable group of the population\" refers back to women, so that's also VIC. \n\nThe international community is called upon to combat impunity. The international community is acting to help victims, so Hero. The Secretary-General's zero tolerance policy is mentioned; the Secretary-General is an organization, so Hero. \n\nThe speaker talks about the poor participation of women in drafting strategies. Here, women are excluded from decision-making, making them Victims. However, when the speaker says \"foster women's participation by reserving a key role for them,\" women are being empowered, so here they could be Hero and Victim combined? Because they're both needing help (Victim) and being agents of change (Hero). The example given in the guidelines shows \"women's empowerment\" as HER_VIC. So \"women's participation\" here might be HER_VIC. Wait, but guideline 4a says not to tag abstract concepts like participation. Wait, the example says: \u201cwomen\u2019s participation.\u201d In the latter example, women are the entities that are taking heroic action, while their participation refers to a concept. So in the example, \"women's participation\" is not tagged, but \"women\" in \"women as agents of peace\" is tagged as HER. Wait, the example says: \"women as agents of peace\" would be HER. So in the current speech, \"foster women's participation\" \u2013 here, \"women's\" is possessive, so according to guideline 1c, possessive modifiers are included. So \"women's\" would be part of the NP. But participation is an abstract concept. So the entire NP is \"women's participation\", but since participation is abstract, do we tag \"women's\" as the entity? The guidelines say to include possessive modifiers within the NP. So \"women's participation\" \u2013 the NP is \"women's participation\", but participation is an abstract concept. However, guideline 4a says not to tag abstract concepts. So maybe only \"women\" is the entity here. But \"women's\" is a possessive modifier. Wait, in the example given in guidelines 4a: \u201cwomen\u2019s participation.\u201d In that example, women are the entities taking action, but participation is the concept, so only \"women's\" is tagged as HER. Wait, the example given in the guidelines under 4a is: \u201c<HER>women\u2019s</HER> participation.\u201d So in that case, \"women's\" is tagged as Hero. So applying that here, \"foster women's participation\" would tag \"women's\" as HER_VIC if they are both victims and heroes. But in the context here, women are being empowered (Hero) but previously were victims. The sentence says \"the poor results... due to the continuing low participation of women... crucial to foster women's participation by reserving a key role for them in conflict-prevention policies...\" So women are being excluded (Victim) and need to be included (Hero). So \"women's participation\" here, the \"women's\" would be HER_VIC. So tag as <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC>.\n\nMoving on, the speaker mentions Senegal adopting a law for parity. \"My country\" refers to Senegal, which is taking action to help women, so Hero. The national gender-parity monitoring body is an organization, so Hero. ECOWAS is an organization contributing positively, so Hero. The Dakar Declaration is a document, but unless personified, not tagged. The speech says \"the action plan of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Dakar Declaration by focusing on...\" Since ECOWAS is an organization involved in positive action, tag as Hero. The Dakar Declaration might not be personified here, so not tagged.\n\nLater, \"UN-Women and all of the other relevant bodies\" are organizations acting to help, so Heroes. The Security Council is mentioned as inspiring an international dynamic. The Security Council here is being portrayed as a Hero, but in example 2, the Security Council was tagged as HER_VIL because it took five decades to act. Here, the context is positive, so just HER. \n\nThe mention of \"illicit trade in small arms and light weapons\" \u2013 the traders would be Villains, but the phrase itself is an abstract concept. However, \"illicit trade\" is not a person or organization. The \"diplomatic conference of 2012\" is an event, not an entity, so not tagged. \n\nFinally, the speaker expresses hope about the arms trade treaty. The treaty itself is a law, so not tagged. \n\nNow, checking for combined roles. For example, when women are both victims and heroes. In the part where women are victims of violence but also being empowered, their mentions might need combined tags. \n\nAlso, need to check for nested annotations. For example, if a villain group is mentioned that includes victims within them. But in this speech, I don't see examples of that. \n\nAnother point: when the speaker refers to \"my delegation\" or \"Senegal\", these are possessive NPs and should be tagged as Hero since they're taking positive actions. \n\nMake sure not to tag abstract concepts like \"peacekeeping\", \"conflict-prevention\", etc., only the entities involved. \n\nLet me go through each paragraph again to ensure I didn't miss any entities.\n\nFirst paragraph: Thanks to Secretary-General, Mr. Lazarous Kapambwe, Ms. Michelle Bachelet, Ms. Orzala Ashraf Nemat. These are people/organizations contributing, so Heroes. \n\nSecond paragraph: resolution 1325 (2000) as Hero, along with 1820, 1888, 1889. \n\nThird paragraph: \"thousands of women and girls\" as Victims. \"vulnerable group\" referring to them as VIC. \"international community\" as Hero. \n\nFourth paragraph: Secretary-General's policy \u2013 Hero. \"women\" in participation as HER_VIC. \n\nFifth paragraph: \"my country\" (Senegal) as Hero. \"national gender-parity monitoring body\" as Hero. \n\nSixth paragraph: ECOWAS as Hero. \"UN-Women\" as Hero. \"Security Council\" as Hero. \n\nSeventh paragraph: \"illicit trade in small arms\" \u2013 not an entity, so no tag. \n\nConclusion: \"Security Council\" again as Hero. \n\nAlso, note that \"peacekeeping personnel\" in other examples were sometimes Villains if involved in abuse, but here, there's no mention of negative actions by them. \n\nI think that's all. Now applying the tags accordingly.\n</think>\n\nMr. Diallo (Senegal) (spoke in French): I would  like to convey <HER>my delegation</HER>'s sincere congratulations  for the convening of this important debate on women,  peace and security, which represents, Madam  President, the crowning moment of your remarkable  presidency of the Council for the month of October. I  would like to thank <HER>the Secretary-General</HER> for his  statement, as well as <HER>Mr. Lazarous Kapambwe</HER>,  President of the Economic and Social Council,  <HER>Ms. Michelle Bachelet</HER>, Executive Director of  <HER>UN-Women</HER>, and <HER>Ms. Orzala Ashraf Nemat</HER>,  representative of civil society, for their important  contributions.    <HER>My delegation</HER> has a special interest in the topic,  because <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> represented an  enormous step forward in the protection of <VIC>women</VIC> and  highlighted the importance of their role in all aspects  of United Nations peacekeeping. Nonetheless, while it  has remained far from being a cure-all, <HER>resolution 1325  (2000)</HER> has contributed, along with <HER>resolutions 1820  (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1889 (2009)</HER>, to improving the  normative framework for preventing gender-based  violence and for protecting <VIC>women</VIC> against that  scourge.    It should, however, be pointed out that, despite  those praiseworthy efforts, persistent shortcomings  have exposed <VIC>thousands of women and girls</VIC> to various  types of barbaric abuse and atrocities. In fact, rape  continues to be used as a weapon of war in certain  conflict areas, and the ongoing existence of sexual and  gender-based violence, even at the end of a conflict,  represents an almost permanent threat to the security  and health of <VIC>that vulnerable group of the population</VIC>.  That is why <HER>the international community</HER> must firmly  commit to vigorously combating impunity in order to  guarantee the effective prevention of all forms of  violence against <VIC>women</VIC>.    While welcoming the zero tolerance policy on  sexual violence of <HER>the Secretary-General</HER>, we must, in  addition, insist on the need to bolster the role of  <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in conflict-prevention and resolution.  Nevertheless, the poor results in that area have  undoubtedly been due to the continuing low  participation of <VIC>women</VIC> in the drafting of  implementation strategies. I consider it crucial,  therefore, to foster <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> participation by reserving  a key role for <HER_VIC>them</HER_VIC> in conflict-prevention policies, as  well as policies on peacekeeping, peacebuilding and  social and economic recovery. In that context, there  must be a special focus on <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> empowerment,  which will require significant investment in education,  training and maternal health.    In View of our considerable awareness of that  dynamic process, <HER>my country</HER> has allocated a  significant part of its budget to education and health,  and on 14 May 2010, it adopted a law to establish full  parity in all partially or fully elected bodies. In that  manner, <HER>Senegal</HER> intends to ensure the effective  participation of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in decision-making processes.  To follow up on that law, <HER>a national gender-parity  monitoring body</HER> was set up and will be officially  inaugurated on 16 November.    <HER>Senegal</HER> has already adopted its national action  plan to implement <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>.  Furthermore, it has sought to make a positive  contribution to drafting the action plan of <HER>the  Economic Community of West African States  (ECOWAS)</HER> and the Dakar Declaration by focusing on  the four following areas: first, effective participation of  <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in the peace process; secondly, protection of  <VIC>women and girls</VIC>; thirdly, prevention of gender-based  violence through preventive diplomacy and early  warning systems, and fourthly, reconstruction and  victim assistance.  It is certain that those significant national and  regional level initiatives are welcome. However, they  will achieve the desired success only if linked with an  international dynamic inspired by <HER>the Security Council</HER>  and based on coordinated efforts on the part of  <HER>UN-Women</HER> and all of the other relevant bodies. There  is also a need to improve <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> involvement in  peacekeeping operations by following up on the  laudable efforts already carried out in that domain.    The effective prevention of sexual violence also  requires stringent measures to vigorously combat the  root causes of conflict exacerbation. Since there is an  established link between what is known as low-level  conflicts and wide-scale violence against <VIC>women</VIC>, I  would like to launch an appeal for coordinated and  focused action against the illicit trade in small arms  and light weapons. In that regard, <HER>my delegation</HER>  cherishes the hope that the diplomatic conference of  2012 will enable the adoption of a robust arms trade  treaty.    Allow me to conclude by expressing <HER>my  country</HER>'s conviction that the efforts to be undertaken  by 2015 will enable <HER>the Security Council</HER> to take stock  at that time of the positive implementation of  <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>.",
    "UNSC_2013_SPV.7044_spch013.txt": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this annotation task step by step. First, I need to carefully read the provided speech and identify all the entities that fit the roles of Hero, Villain, or Victim based on the guidelines. \n\nStarting with the speaker, Mr. Laassel from Morocco. The initial part includes thanks to various officials. According to the guidelines, entities like the Secretary-General, High Commissioner, and Executive Director of UN Women should be tagged as Heroes because they are recognized for their roles in helping victims or promoting peace. So, \"Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\", \"Ms. Navanethem Pillay\", and \"Ms. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka\" would be <HER> tags.\n\nNext, Ms. Brigitte Balipou is mentioned as the Chair of an NGO Working Group. Since NGOs are organizations working towards a cause, she should also be a Hero. The report and resolution 2122 (2013) are mentioned, but resolutions are only tagged if personified. Here, the report is just referenced, so no tag. However, when they mention the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence, that's an organization taking action, so <HER>.\n\nThe speech talks about women's participation and protection. Phrases like \"women's participation in decision-making\" involve women as both Heroes (participating) and Victims (needing protection). But according to guideline 4a, abstract concepts like participation aren't tagged. However, when specific groups like \"refugee or displaced women\" are mentioned, they are Victims because they suffer from insecurity and limited access to services. So those should be <VIC>.\n\nThe Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) is acting to protect women, so they're Heroes. Member States are mentioned in the context of complying with obligations, which is a call to action, so they might be Heroes. However, when they're urged to register refugees, it's a call to action, so <HER> for Member States here.\n\nThere's a mention of \"States parties to the 1951 Convention\" needing to comply. Since they're being called to action, they're Heroes. The \"refugees\" themselves, especially women, are Victims. \n\nThe part about \"women and children\" suffering consequences of armed conflict clearly marks them as Victims. The responsibility lies with States, which are Heroes if they take action, but here it's about their responsibility, so maybe Hero. However, if they're failing, they might be Villains, but the text doesn't portray them negatively. So States are Heroes here as they're supposed to act.\n\nThe strategic framework and seven-point action plan by the Secretary-General are initiatives led by Heroes. Local women's entities as a driving force are Heroes. \n\nNeed to check for combined roles. For example, \"women refugees\" are Victims, but if they're also agents in peacebuilding, maybe combined. However, in the text, they're mainly portrayed as needing protection, so just <VIC>. \n\nAlso, ensure not to tag abstract concepts. Terms like \"peace agreements\" or \"security sector reform\" aren't tagged. Only specific entities like DPKO or Member States when they're acting.\n\nNow, applying the tags line by line, making sure to include entire noun phrases and possessive modifiers. For example, \"my delegation\" is a Hero. \"Refugee or displaced women\" as a single NP tagged as Victim. \n\nCheck for overlapping annotations. For example, if a Villain is causing harm to a Victim within the same phrase. But in this speech, most entities are either Heroes or Victims without overlap. \n\nFinally, ensure spacing and punctuation are preserved exactly as in the original. No adding or removing spaces, even if there are multiple spaces. Also, check for any mentions of UN Resolutions. Resolution 1325 is mentioned, but only tagged if personified. In \"implementation of resolution 1325 (2000)\", it's not personified, so no tag. However, in \"the meeting planned for 2015 on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000)\", still not personified. So no tag there.\n\nMake sure not to tag the speaker or entities separated by colons at the beginning. The initial \"Mr. Laassel (Morocco)\" isn't tagged. \n\nDouble-check all guidelines to ensure compliance. For example, \"women's rights\" is an abstract concept, so \"women\" in that context isn't tagged. But when \"women\" are specifically mentioned as participants or victims, they are tagged accordingly.\n</think>\n\nMr. Laassel (Morocco) (spoke in French): Allow  me at the outset to convey to you, Sir, on behalf of the  <HER>Moroccan delegation</HER>, our gratitude for the convening  of this debate. I thank for their briefings <HER>Secretary-  General Ban Ki-moon</HER>; <HER>Ms. Navanethem Pillay, High  Commissioner for Human Rights</HER>; and <HER>Ms. Phumzile  Mlambo-Ngcuka, Executive Director of UN Women</HER>.  I welcome <HER>Ms. Mlambo-Ngcuka's</HER> appointment and  assure her of our full cooperation and support as she  discharges her mission. We also thank <HER>Ms. Brigitte  Balipou, Chair of the NGO Working Group on Women,  Peace and Security</HER>, for her constructive contribution.    <HER>My delegation</HER> welcomes the report of the Secretary-  General on women, peace and security (S/2013/525)  and the adoption of resolution 2122 (2013) on the issue.  The report takes stock of the actions and initiatives of  <HER>Member States</HER> in the framework of implementation  of the resolution, especially in strengthening women's  participation in decision-making, integrating gender-  specific issues in peacekeeping operations and  training staff who participate in those operations.  The report confirms that much work remains, despite  the significant progress of women's participation in  peacekeeping operations and their representation in the  decision-making process.    The signing of peace agreements and ceasefire  agreements and the implementation of national action  plans and programmes for the protection of <VIC>women</VIC> in  conflict-affected countries have made it possible to  identify, in a more appropriate way, the ways and means  likely to promote women's rights and to strengthen their  participation in efforts to prevent and resolve conflicts  and in post-conflict reconstruction.    <HER>My delegation</HER> supports the initiatives of <HER>the Team  of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in  Conflict</HER> to assist <HER>States</HER> in strengthening the rule of  law, transitional justice and security sector reform. <HER>My  delegation</HER> also supports the elaboration by <HER>the Standing  Committee on Women, Peace and Security</HER> of the  strategic framework intended to assist <HER>Member States</HER>  in achieving their interim objectives, in preparation for  the meeting planned for 2015 on the implementation  of resolution 1325 (2000) at national, regional and  international levels.    Effective and optimal empowerment of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>  in the context of peacebuilding and post-conflict  reconstruction involves the collective and coordinated  action of <HER>the international community</HER> and <HER>the United  Nations system</HER>, through strengthening protection and  prevention measures adapted to specific contexts that  will facilitate the implementation of the resolution.    The establishment of genuine peace requires  the establishment of inclusive and durable political,  economic and social structures. Within that  framework, <HER>local women's entities</HER> are a driving  force in empowering <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and strengthening good  governance. <HER>My delegation</HER> welcomes the work carried  out in the framework of <HER>the United Nations system</HER>  to strengthen <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> capacities and involvement in  mediation and peacebuilding processes. Similarly, it  supports the implementation of <HER>the Secretary-General's  seven-point action plan</HER> (see S/2010/466), which enables  greater consideration of gender issues in peacebuilding  operations.    As for protection, <HER>my delegation</HER> notes with concern  that <VIC>refugee or displaced women</VIC> continue to suffer most  from generalized insecurity, difficult living conditions  and limited access to humanitarian assistance. The  same is true for <VIC>refugee women</VIC> who lack documents  and often face gender-based discrimination, especially  in accessing basic social services. In that connection,  it is essential that <HER>Member States</HER> - especially the  <HER>States parties to the 1951 Convention relating to the  Status of Refugees</HER> - comply with their obligations  and register <VIC>refugees</VIC> in their territory. Registration and  identification programmes can have a positive impact  in empowering <VIC>women refugees</VIC>.    <HER>My delegation</HER> welcomes the efforts undertaken  by <HER>the Department of Peacekeeping Operations  (DPKO)</HER> in the protection of <VIC>women</VIC> in armed conflict  and the consideration of gender-specific issues in the  framework of the maintenance of peace. We stress that  it is important that <HER>DPKO</HER> strengthen its work on the  ground, in coordination with <HER>the relevant parties</HER>.    While the responsibility to put an end to the tragic  consequences of armed conflict for <VIC>women and children</VIC>  lies with <HER>States</HER>, coordinated and sustained action  among <HER>the various national and United Nations actors  involved in the implementation of resolution 1325  (2000)</HER> is necessary to strengthen existing initiatives.    Firm political will and full commitment of <HER>Member  States</HER> to the measures in resolution 1325 (2000)  will guarantee the active participation of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in  <HER>national, regional and international institutions</HER> for  the prevention, protection and management of conflict  situations.",
    "UNSC_2016_SPV.7704_spch087.txt": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this annotation task step by step. First, I need to carefully read through the provided speech and identify all the entities that fit the criteria for Hero, Villain, or Victim based on the guidelines.\n\nStarting with the speaker: Mr. Gata Mavita wa Lufuta from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). According to the guidelines, speakers at the beginning separated by a colon shouldn't be tagged, so I'll leave that part as is.\n\nThe first paragraph thanks France, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and Special Representative Zainab Bangura. These are individuals and a country (France) that are being commended for their efforts, so they should be tagged as Heroes. The phrase \"all those who spoke before me\" is a group being thanked, so also Hero.\n\nNext, the DRC is mentioned as suffering from sexual violence. The country itself isn't a victim here, but the people are. \"girls, women, boys and men\" are victims of rape used as a weapon of war. So those groups should be tagged as Victims.\n\nThe Government of the DRC is taking actions like appointing representatives, adopting plans, and signing decrees. These are proactive steps to combat sexual violence, so the Government is a Hero. Specific roles like the personal representative of the President, the Minister of National Defence, and the military justice system are Heroes as they're part of the government's efforts.\n\nThe rebel armed groups are mentioned as causing conflicts and using rape as a weapon. These groups are Villains. The Forces arm\u00e9es de la R\u00e9publique d\u00e9mocratique du Congo (FARDC) are part of the government's efforts, so their commanders are Heroes when mentioned in the context of their responsibilities.\n\nThe international community, Japan, Ms. Bangura's office, the United Nations Population Fund, and other partners are providing support, so they're Heroes. The United Nations as an organization is also a Hero.\n\nI need to ensure that possessive modifiers are included, like \"my country's Government\" becomes <HER>my country's Government</HER>. Also, when entities are listed together under the same role, like the international community and its components, they should be tagged as a single Hero entity.\n\nCheck for combined roles. The victims (women, girls, etc.) are only Victims here. The Government and its agencies are Heroes. Rebel groups are Villains. No instances where an entity is both Hero and Villain or other combinations based on the context provided.\n\nMake sure not to tag abstract concepts. For example, \"sexual violence\" itself isn't tagged, only the groups affected or perpetrating it. Also, UN resolutions aren't mentioned here, so no need to tag those.\n\nFinally, ensure spacing and punctuation are preserved exactly as in the original. No extra line breaks or missing spaces. Tags should enclose the entire noun phrases without trailing punctuation.\n\nDouble-check each identified entity against the role definitions. Heroes help victims, Villains cause harm, Victims suffer. The Government's actions fit Hero, rebel groups as Villains, and the affected populations as Victims.\n</think>\n\nMr. Gata Mavita wa Lufuta (Democratic Republic of the Congo) (spoke in French): First of all, I  would like to thank <HER>France</HER> for organizing this debate.  I also commend <HER>Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</HER>  and <HER>his Special Representative Zainab Bangura</HER>, as  well as <HER>all those who spoke before me</HER>, for their very  useful presentations.    Sexual violence in conflict situations is a scourge  from which my country, the Democratic Republic of  the Congo, has long suffered. For more than a decade,  my country has experienced especially bloody armed  conflicts in the eastern part of its territory. Those  conflicts, which have caused many human casualties,  are at the source ofthe practice ofusing rape as a weapon  of war. The lives of thousands of <VIC>girls, women, boys  and men</VIC> have thus been disrupted. The consequences  of the situation psychologically, economically and in  medical terms are enormous.    This debate affords us an opportunity to once again  touch on the efforts of <HER>my country's Government</HER> to  combat this situation. The restoration of peace in the  part of the country formerly occupied by <VIL>rebel armed  groups</VIL> has brought major change. Enormous progress  has been made both in the fight against sexual violence  and at the level of responding to the needs of <VIC>victims</VIC>.  In referring to my country, the report (S/2016/36l) of  the Secretary-General attests to that in mentioning  the appreciable 80 per cent decline in the number of  cases of sexual violence in conflict areas. Among other  things, <HER>my Government</HER> attributes those results to the  following elements: the appointment of <HER>a personal  representative of the President of the Republic in charge  of the fight against sexual violence and the recruitment  of children</HER>; the adoption of a plan of action to combat  sexual violence among <HER>the armed forces</HER> and the  signing ofajoint communique on the issue between <HER>the  Government</HER> and <HER>the United Nations</HER>; the adoption of a  zero-tolerance policy; and the signing by <HER>the Minister  of National Defence</HER> of a decree on the responsibility  of <HER>the unit commanders of the Forces armees de la  Republique democratique du Congo</HER> for combating  sexual violence.    All of those steps reflect the will of <HER>the Government</HER>  to end this scourge and honour its international  commitments. Against that backdrop, <HER>the Government</HER>  is committed to addressing the various problems,  including deliveringjustice in the fight against impunity.  In that connection, 111 cases were decided in 2015 by  <HER>the military justice system</HER>, without regard for the rank  ofthe accused. We have also established a compensation  fund, while <HER>two Senate committees, on sexual violence  and on political, administrative and judicial issues</HER>, are    working on a bill proposed by <HER>the office of the personal  representative of the Head of State</HER>. On preventing  sexual violence, a regional campaign called \"Breaking  the Silence\" will be launched by September. On  socioeconomic reintegration, with the collaboration of  <HER>our national institute for professional training</HER>, training  was organized at Kibumba last September in various  economic sectors for <VIC>survivors</VIC> and <VIC>demobilized  fighters</VIC>. That type of training will continue this year  in Rutshuru in North Kivu and in Bunia and Aru in  Ituri and will train 2,000 people. A $35,000 credit fund  was set up to meet the financial needs of <VIC>some women</VIC>  in Bunia. That progress has been made possible thanks  to <HER>the Government's own resources</HER>, with the technical  support of <HER>the international community</HER>, including  assistance from <HER>Japan</HER> via <HER>Ms. Bangura's office</HER>,  and <HER>the United Nations Population Fund</HER> and <HER>various  other partners</HER>.    In conclusion, <HER>my country</HER> is determined to continue  its efforts to completely eradicate sexual violence. We  highly value the support provided to us in that regard  by <HER>the United Nations</HER> and <HER>the international community</HER>."
