    "UNSC_2000_SPV.4208_spch004.txt": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this annotation task. First, I need to read through the entire speech carefully to identify all the characters mentioned and determine their roles based on the guidelines provided. The roles are Hero, Villain, Victim, or combinations. \n\nStarting with the first paragraph: The speaker is Ms. King, the Special Adviser on Gender Issues. She's addressing the Security Council about a historic debate on \"Women and peace and security.\" The Council is mentioned here. According to the guidelines, organizations like the Security Council can be tagged. Since the Council is holding a significant debate and showing leadership, they might be Heroes. The President's country (Namibia, I think) is credited with leadership in the Windhoek Declaration, which is a positive action. So \"Your country\" here refers to Namibia, which would be a Hero.\n\nNext, the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) is mentioned. Since it's a UN group contributing to peace, they're likely Heroes. The Windhoek Declaration and Namibia Plan of Action are outcomes that helped mainstream gender perspectives, so those initiatives are Heroic. The entities fighting for women's rights here are \"all those fighting for women's right to participate,\" which would be Heroes. The General Assembly's special session \"Women 2000\" is another Hero entity.\n\nMoving on, the Security Council's decision to take a thematic approach, under Bangladesh's chair, recognizing women as actors in the peace process. Bangladesh here is a Hero. The representative of Canada led a discussion on Afghanistan women's situation, so Canada is a Hero. Resolution 1314 (2000) by the Council is a Hero if it's personified. The Secretary-General is mentioned returning from an area where he saw women and men's roles in peacebuilding. The Secretary-General is a Hero. The Brahimi Panel's report on peace operations is mentioned; since it's a report leading to action, maybe Hero.\n\nIn discussing conflict's effects, women and girls in armed conflict are initially seen as victims. So \"women and girls\" would be Victims. But later, the debate shows progress, so maybe they transition to Hero and Victim? The study on peace operations in Bosnia, Cambodia, etc., by DPKO, the Division for the Advancement of Women, etc., are Hero organizations. Member States funding the study are Heroes.\n\nThe study's findings: women in missions empowering local women. Local women are Victims but also Heroes when they participate. So \"local women\" might be HER_VIC. Women peacekeepers are Heroes. The Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) encouraging women's participation is Hero. Troop-contributing countries sending women are Heroes.\n\nIn examples like South Africa, El Salvador, Namibia, women promoting voter education are Heroes. Women in refugee camps taking peace-building activities are Heroes and Victims (since they're in camps). Grass-roots women's organizations, OAU African Women's Committee, etc., are Heroes. UN agencies like UNHCR, UNICEF, UNDP, UNIFEM are Heroes.\n\nThe Beijing Platform for Action, Windhoek Declaration are Hero documents if personified. The Brahimi report's recommendation to appoint women as special representatives is Hero. The call by women heads of State is Hero. The Millennium Declaration and UN Charter are mentioned as foundational documents promoting equality, so if personified, they're Heroes.\n\nNeed to check for Villains. Are there any entities causing harm? The speech mentions non-State actors, children involved in conflict, proliferation of small arms. \"Non-State actors\" and \"children\" (as child soldiers) might be Villains. The video \"Armed to the Teeth\" shows small arms proliferation, so maybe the arms dealers or those responsible are Villains. However, the guidelines say to tag only people, organizations, countries, groups. So \"non-State actors\" could be VIL. \"Children\" as child soldiers might be Victims forced into roles, but the ones making them soldiers could be Villains. However, the text says \"even children become involved\" without specifying who involves them. Maybe \"children\" here are Victims. The \"proliferation of small arms\" is an abstract concept, so not tagged. The video is a document, maybe not tagged unless personified.\n\nIn the part about women's rights to land when spouses are killed or disappeared, the spouses are Victims. The ones causing the disappearances would be Villains, but they aren't explicitly mentioned here. So \"spouse killed or 'disappeared'\" is VIC.\n\nAlso, when discussing code of conduct for peacekeepers, any infringements would involve Villains, but the peacekeepers themselves might be Heroes unless they commit violations. The text mentions \"where there are infringements, there should be... discipline,\" so the infringing peacekeepers would be VIL, but the text doesn't specify them, just refers to the process. So maybe no tag there.\n\nNow, applying the tags:\n\n- \"the Council\" (Security Council) as HER.\n- \"Your country\" (Namibia) as HER.\n- \"United Nations Transition Assistance Group\" as HER.\n- \"Windhoek Declaration and Namibia Plan of Action\" as HER.\n- \"all those fighting for women's right to participate\" as HER.\n- \"General Assembly's twenty-third special session\" as HER.\n- \"Council's decision\" (thematic approach) as HER.\n- \"Bangladesh\" as HER.\n- \"representative of Canada\" as HER.\n- \"resolution 1314 (2000)\" as HER if personified.\n- \"Secretary-General\" as HER.\n- \"Brahimi Panel's report\" as HER.\n- \"Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO)\" as HER.\n- \"Division for the Advancement of Women\" as HER.\n- \"Member States\" (funding the study) as HER.\n- \"local women\" as HER_VIC.\n- \"women peacekeepers\" as HER.\n- \"troop-contributing countries\" as HER.\n- \"grass-roots women's organizations\" as HER.\n- \"Organization of African Unity (OAU) African Women's Committee\" as HER.\n- \"United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\" as HER.\n- \"Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights\" as HER.\n- \"United Nations Children's Fund\" as HER.\n- \"World Food Programme\" as HER.\n- \"World Health Organization\" as HER.\n- \"United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\" as HER.\n- \"United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM)\" as HER.\n- \"United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat)\" as HER.\n- \"Administrative Committee on Coordination's Inter-Agency Committee on Women and Gender Equality\" as HER.\n- \"Task Force on Women and Peace and Security\" as HER.\n- \"Beijing Platform for Action\" as HER.\n- \"Beijing +5 outcome document\" as HER.\n- \"Windhoek Declaration\" as HER.\n- \"Namibia Plan of Action\" as HER.\n- \"Brahimi report\" as HER.\n- \"women heads of State and Government\" as HER.\n- \"Millennium Declaration\" as HER.\n- \"United Nations Charter\" as HER.\n\nVictims:\n- \"women and girls in armed conflict\" as VIC.\n- \"women in Afghanistan\" as VIC.\n- \"local women\" (when referring to those in conflict areas) as VIC.\n- \"women in refugee or displaced-persons camps\" as VIC.\n- \"spouse killed or 'disappeared'\" as VIC.\n\nVillains:\n- \"non-State actors\" as VIL.\n- \"those who commit sexual violence\" (implied in local women confiding in peacekeepers about rape) but not explicitly mentioned as an entity. The perpetrators are not named, so maybe no tag.\n- \"child soldiers\" might be VIC if forced, but the text says \"children become involved\" without blaming them, so perhaps not tagged as Villains.\n\nCombined roles:\n- When women are both contributing to peace (Hero) and suffering (Victim), like \"local women\" in conflict zones, use HER_VIC.\n\nNow, applying the tags inline, ensuring noun phrases are fully captured, possessive modifiers included, and overlapping tags nested where necessary.\n\nFor example, \"women and girls in armed conflict\" is a Victim. Later, \"local women\" might be HER_VIC when they are empowered but also victims. The study's mention of \"women staff\" in missions as Heroes. \n\nAlso, organizations like DPKO, UNDP, etc., are Heroes. When the speech mentions \"the sceptics,\" but they are abstract, not specific entities, so not tagged.\n\nIn the part about \"women's right to participate,\" the right itself is abstract, but \"those fighting for women's right\" are Heroes.\n\nNeed to check each mention of entities and apply tags accordingly, making sure not to miss any. Also, ensure that combined roles are applied where the context indicates multiple roles.\n</think>\n\n<HER>Ms. King</HER>: I am particularly honoured today, as  \n<HER>Special Adviser on Gender Issues</HER>, to have the  \nopportunity to speak in this debate, which is so  \nhistoric, when for the first time <HER>the Council</HER> has decided  \nto devote an entire open discussion to the topic  \n\"<VIC>Women</VIC> and peace and security\".  \n\nIt is only fairly recently that the experience of  \n<VIC>women and girls in armed conflict</VIC> has been discussed,  \nand then discussion has usually concentrated on their  \nrole as <VIC>victims</VIC>. Today's debate will show that we have  \ncome a long way in a relatively short time. <HER>Your  \ncountry</HER>'s strong leadership, <HER>Mr. President</HER>, in holding  \nthe landmark May seminar which marked this year's  \ntenth anniversary of the <HER>United Nations Transition  \nAssistance Group</HER> resulted in the historic <HER>Windhoek  \nDeclaration</HER> and <HER>Namibia Plan of Action</HER> on  \n\"Mainstreaming a Gender Perspective in  \nMultidimensional Peace Support Operations\". This  \nachievement has won universal admiration among <HER>all  \nthose fighting for <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>'s right to participate in all  \naspects of the peace process</HER>. It and your distinguished  \nchairing of the <HER>General Assembly</HER>'s twenty-third  \nspecial session, \"<HER_VIC>Women 2000: gender equality,  \ndevelopment and peace for the twenty-first century</HER_VIC>\",  \nwhich immediately followed in June, constitute  \nimportant steps along the way to considering the  \n<HER>United Nations peace operations</HER> from the point of view  \nof both <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and men.  \n\nOther important developments have led to today's  \nmeeting. They include <HER>the Council</HER>'s decision to take a  \nthematic approach to its work; the recognition that <HER>the  \nCouncil</HER> gave - under the chair of <HER>Bangladesh</HER> - on  \nInternational <HER_VIC>Women</HER_VIC>'s Day, 8 March, to <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> as  \nactors in the peace process; the discussion on the  \nsituation of <VIC>women in Afghanistan</VIC>, which took place in  \nApril, led by <HER>the representative of Canada</HER>; and <HER>the  \nCouncil</HER>'s <HER>resolution 1314 (2000)</HER> of 11 August.  \n\nThe timeliness of this discussion is also  \nsignificant. <HER>The Secretary-General</HER> has just returned  \nfrom an area where he undoubtedly had an opportunity  \nto see at first hand the role <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and men should  \nplay in their societies to bring about peace and to  \nrebuild those societies. The discussion also coincides  \nwith the consideration of <HER>the Brahimi Panel</HER>'s report  \n(8/2000/809) on peace operations and its  \nimplementation.  \n\nThere are three broad areas to be considered in  \nthe context of today's discussion: how armed conflict  \naffects <VIC>women</VIC>; how <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> actually respond to  \nconflict, the peace process and post-conflict  \nreconstruction; and how we plan strategically for a  \nfuture in which <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> are equal partners with men in  \nenhancing our effectiveness in peace operations.  \n\nToday I would like to concentrate on the two  \nlatter points, drawing on my experience as <HER>Chief of  \nMission in the United Nations Observer Mission in  \nSouth Africa (UNOMSA)</HER>.  \n\nWhat do <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> actually do in conflict situations,  \nand how do they respond? <HER>The Secretary-General</HER> has  \nrepeatedly emphasized the changing nature of war. He  \nhas noted that modern warfare is increasingly  \nconducted within, rather than between, <VIC>States</VIC>, and that  \n<HER>the Security Council</HER> is now called on to deal with such  \nconflicts. He has stressed that more and more <VIL>non-State  \nactors</VIL> are protagonists in armed conflict; even <VIC>children</VIC>  \nbecome involved. The proliferation of small arms and  \nthe ease with which they can be acquired, clearly  \nshown in the <HER>Department for Disarmament Affairs</HER> and  \n<HER>Department of Public Information</HER> video documentary  \n\"Armed to the Teeth\", has also added a new dimension.  \n\nThe socio-economic fabric of a country has now  \nto be the major focus of attention. Societal dynamics  \nthus become a key guide to finding entry points into  \nresolving disputes. <HER>Groups within each society</HER>, and  \nespecially <HER>women's groups</HER>, <HER>non-governmental</HER>,  \n<HER>religious</HER> and <HER>other groups</HER>, have a major role to play.  \nWhether these groups were formed before the conflict  \nor during it is not important. What is important is that  \nthey must be part of all stages of the peace  \nnegotiations, in planning for the future, in rebuilding  \nand in crafting preventive strategies to avoid conflict.  \n\nOften, those of us who have seen the value of  \n<HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>'s participation in peace operations at first hand  \nare challenged by the sceptics to present empirical  \nrather than anecdotal findings. In this connection, I am  \npleased to report on the results of a joint three-year  \neffort of <HER>the Department of Peacekeeping Operations  \n(DPKO)</HER>, <HER>my office</HER> and <HER>the Division for the  \nAdvancement of Women</HER> of <HER>the Department of  \nEconomic and Social Affairs</HER>, a study that was  \nsupported by the generous funding of <HER>several Member  \nStates</HER>. This study, \"<HER>Mainstreaming a Gender  \nPerspective in Multidimensional Peace Operations</HER>\" has  \njust been finalized.  \nThe study looks at five peace operations, in  \n<HER>Bosnia and Herzegovina</HER>, <HER>Cambodia</HER>, <HER>El Salvador</HER>,  \n<HER>Namibia</HER> and <HER>South Africa</HER>. It answers the sceptics by  \ngiving objective and empirical findings on what  \n<HER>women staff</HER> do in missions; whether and how they  \ninfluence the outcomes; and how their participating  \nequally with men can improve the efficiency of <HER>United  \nNations peacekeeping</HER>. <HER>The Windhoek Declaration</HER> and  \n<HER>the Namibia Plan of Action</HER> were informed by these  \nfindings.  \n\nExactly what does this study tell us? It shows  \nunequivocally that when there is a critical mass of  \n<HER>women</HER> in a mission - at least 30 per cent - <HER_VIC>local  \nwomen</HER_VIC> are more easily mobilized to join peace  \ncommittees. This occurred in <HER>South Africa</HER>, <HER>El Salvador</HER>  \nand <HER>Namibia</HER>, where <HER>women</HER> actively promoted voter  \neducation and the rights of <VIC>individual women</VIC> to vote.  \nIn other words, <HER>women</HER>'s participation in <HER>United  \nNations missions</HER> empowers <HER_VIC>local women</HER_VIC> and may  \ninspire them to organize for the achievement of a  \ndemocratic society.  \n\n<HER>Women</HER>'s participation has the capacity to expand  \nthe debate a little further so that it may encompass  \nmore diverse subjects, including those that may be  \nmore relevant to <VIC>women and children</VIC>. <HER>Women</HER> are  \nfrequently less hierarchical in dealing with <VIC>local  \ncommunities</VIC> and listen more, thereby having better  \ninsights into the root causes of conflict. <HER_VIC>Local women</HER_VIC>  \nare more likely to confide in <HER>women peacekeepers</HER> on  \nsuch matters as rape and other sexual violence. The  \npresence of a critical mass of <HER>women</HER> appears to foster  \nconfidence and trust among <VIC>the local population</VIC>, and  \nthis is critical to successful operations, such as in <HER>El  \nSalvador</HER>. <HER>Women</HER> are active negotiators and able to see  \nmore clearly issues that affect <VIC>women</VIC> differently than  \nmen.  \n\n<HER>Women</HER>'s participation in all aspects of a mission  \ncan help to break down stereotypes held by <VIC>women</VIC> in  \nmany <VIC>local communities</VIC>, especially where <HER>women  \npeacekeepers</HER> serve in a broad spectrum of the activities  \nof a mission. This has had a spin-off effect on the  \nparticipation of <HER_VIC>local women</HER_VIC> in decision-making  \npositions. <HER>Women political monitors</HER> are just as willing  \nand capable of serving in dangerous or isolated areas as  \nmen, and do so just as effectively.  \n\nThe study also shows that mixed teams of <HER>women  \nand men</HER>, a significant proportion of <HER>women team  \nleaders</HER>, <HER>women special representatives</HER> or <HER>heads of  \nmission</HER>, or a conscious effort by a <HER>special  \nrepresentative</HER> to seek the best staff, whether <HER>women</HER> or  \nmen, has a positive influence on the outcome. <HER>Women</HER>  \nalso respond by participating in <HER>the troop-contributing  \ncountries</HER>' military and civilian police contingents. <HER>The  \nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations</HER> has made  \nstrenuous efforts to encourage <HER>Member States</HER> to send  \n<HER>women</HER> on missions, on the basis of equity, as their  \npresence can assist in defusing potentially tense  \nsituations. Much more should be done in order to  \nencourage <HER>women</HER> to enter this service.  \n\nWhat do this and other studies tell us about what  \n<HER_VIC>local women</HER_VIC> do? There is abundant evidence to show  \nthat even when having to flee to safety with their  \nfamilies or protecting them in <VIC>refugee or displaced-  \npersons camps</VIC>, <HER>women</HER> take on a number of peace-  \nbuilding activities.  \n\n<HER>Women</HER> are active at both formal and informal  \nlevels. With few exceptions, <HER>women</HER> are not present in  \nformal peace negotiations. However, <HER>women</HER> have been  \npart of these negotiations, as we saw in the field in  \n<HER>Burundi</HER>, and in <HER>Guatemala</HER> and <HER>South Africa</HER>. <HER>Somali  \nwomen</HER> helped to bring the clan leaders back into the  \nnegotiations at one stage and were permitted to join the  \nnegotiations as observers.  \n\nMost of the activities, however, take place at the  \ninformal level. <HER>Grass-roots women's organizations</HER> in  \nseveral countries have sponsored peace education;  \nencouraged <VIC>child soldiers</VIC> to lay down arms; organized  \n<HER>groups advocating peace across party and ethnic lines</HER>;  \norganized campaigns against small arms, such as <HER>the  \nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) African  \nWomen's Committee on peace and development</HER>;  \ninfluenced repatriation processes and established  \nservices for <VIC>returning exiles</VIC>, such as in <HER>Guatemala</HER>;  \ncontributed to ending conflict; negotiated the release of  \n<VIC>hostages</VIC>; and established <HER>legal support groups</HER> to get  \nrecognition for <VIC>women</VIC>'s rights to land and household  \nproperty which may have been in the name of a <VIC>spouse  \nkilled or \"disappeared\" in a conflict</VIC>.  \n\n<HER>Women at the local level</HER> are a rich resource  \nwaiting to be systematically tapped by <HER>the international  \ncommunity</HER>. Many aspects of these informal activities  \nhave been encouraged, supported financially and  \ndocumented by <HER>the United Nations</HER> and its agencies. In  \nthis connection, in addition to the work of <HER>the  \nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations</HER>, <HER>the  \nDepartment of Political Affairs</HER>, <HER>the Office for the  \nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs</HER> and <HER>the  \nDepartment for Disarmament Affairs</HER> should be  \nmentioned. Special mention should also be made of <HER>the  \nwork of the Office of the United Nations High  \nCommissioner for Refugees</HER>, <HER>the Office of the High  \nCommissioner for Human Rights</HER>, <HER>the United Nations  \nChildren's Fund</HER>, <HER>the World Food Programme</HER> and <HER>the  \nWorld Health Organization</HER>. <HER>The United Nations  \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP)</HER>, <HER>the United Nations  \nDevelopment Fund for Women (UNIFEM)</HER> and <HER>the  \nUnited Nations Centre for Human Settlements  \n(Habitat)</HER> should also be credited with pioneering work  \nat the national and grass-roots levels. <HER>Good practices</HER>  \nhave been identified, studied and published, including  \nthe study by <HER>the United Nations Research Institute for  \nSocial Development</HER>, \"<HER>Women and Post-Conflict  \nReconstruction</HER>\". The exchange of information on these  \npractices has enabled <HER>the United Nations system</HER> to  \nencourage <HER>States</HER> engaged in rehabilitation to work in  \npartnership with and sustain <HER>women's groups</HER> and <HER>civil  \nsociety</HER> engaged in these essential but often  \nunrecognized activities. <HER>Capacity-building for  \nleadership and governance</HER> led by <HER>UNDP</HER> and <HER>UNIFEM</HER>  \nhas greatly facilitated <HER>women</HER>'s ability to play  \nconstructive roles.  \n\n<HER>These entities</HER> are all members of <HER>the  \nAdministrative Committee on Coordination's Inter-  \nAgency Committee on Women and Gender Equality</HER>,  \nwhich I chair. We have lately formed <HER>a Task Force on  \nWomen and Peace and Security</HER> to strengthen  \ncollaboration on this critical issue.  \n\nThis brings me to our vision for the future. The  \nbasic blueprint appears in <HER>the Beijing Platform for  \nAction</HER>, <HER>the Beijing + 5 outcome document</HER>, <HER>the  \nWindhoek Declaration</HER> and <HER>the Namibia Plan of Action</HER>.  \nIt also appears in the many powerful statements from  \n<HER>women's groups</HER> that we heard yesterday in <HER>the  \nCouncil</HER>'s Arria-formula meeting.  \n\nThe planning of any mission must include gender  \nequality aspects. The mandate of the mission and the  \nguidelines for <HER>special representatives</HER> must clearly  \nindicate that gender considerations must be integrated  \ninto the mission's goals and <HER>the head of mission</HER> be  \naccountable. Each mission should have a plan for  \nincorporating gender issues into all aspects of the  \nmission's work. There should be a <HER>gender unit</HER>,  \nadequately staffed and resourced to provide the  \nnecessary backstopping on the mission site, and one in  \n<HER>DPKO</HER> for overall oversight. I am pleased to state that  \n<HER>DPKO</HER> has established two such units- one in <HER>East  \nTimor</HER> and one in <HER>Kosovo</HER> - and <HER>gender focal points</HER> in  \n<HER>Sierra Leone</HER> and <HER>Western Sahara</HER>. All sectors of the  \ntransition or rebuilding process should take gender  \nissues into account. Greater attention must be paid to  \nensuring the appointment of <HER>women</HER> as <HER>special  \nrepresentatives</HER>, in accordance with <HER>the Brahimi report</HER>  \nand <HER>the call by women heads of State and Government</HER>  \nof 5 September. <HER>The Council</HER> may wish to ensure that  \nall the reports that it receives on missions contain  \ninformation and data on the extent to which a gender  \nperspective has been introduced and on the number and  \nlevel of <HER>women</HER> working in the various missions.  \nWorking with <HER>the agencies</HER> on the ground, <HER>the political  \nand development wings of the mission</HER> should organize  \nthe mobilization of <HER>community groups</HER>, especially  \n<HER>women's groups</HER>, and expand the pool of skills needed  \nto sustain the peace process. <HER>A roster of such groups</HER>  \ncould be kept by <HER>DPKO</HER>, in collaboration with <HER>regional  \nbodies</HER> and <HER>agencies</HER>. <HER>The code of conduct for  \npeacekeepers</HER> should be regularly updated and where  \nthere are infringements, there should be a continuation  \nof apprehension and discipline. Should it be decided to  \nappoint <HER>a new assistant secretary-general</HER> in <HER>the  \nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations</HER>, as proposed  \nin <HER>the Panel</HER>'s report, strong consideration should be  \ngiven to appointing <HER>a woman</HER> to one of the three  \n<HER>assistant secretary-general</HER> posts in <HER>the Department</HER>.  \n\nIn closing, may I recall the main finding of the  \njoint study made by <HER>the Department of Peacekeeping  \nOperations</HER> and <HER>the Division for the Advancement of  \nWomen</HER>. It was that the most important lesson learned  \nis that lessons are not always learned. Lessons from  \n<HER>Namibia</HER> and <HER>South Africa</HER> had little effect on  \n<HER>Cambodia</HER> or <HER>Bosnia Herzegovina</HER>, for example. <HER>Gender  \nequality issues</HER> are absolutely essential to the success of  \nany peace operation. We cannot exclude half the  \nworld's resources from participating in peace.  \nThe fundamental human right to have and to  \nenjoy equality is a given. It was emphasized by <HER>the  \nBeijing Conference</HER> and reaffirmed again in <HER>the  \nBeijing +5 outcome document</HER> and even more so at <HER>the  \nMillennium Declaration</HER>. There can be no peace  \nwithout gender equality and no development without  \nboth peace and equality. Without the equal and fair  \nparticipation of <HER>women</HER> in decision-making positions in  \n<HER>the United Nations</HER> and also in <HER>Member States</HER>, as well  \nas in this central organ of <HER>the United Nations</HER>, we will  \nnever achieve the vision outlined in <HER>the United Nations  \nCharter</HER>. May this discussion and the decisions that  \nfollow be those in which we demonstrate that, at least  \nin the area of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and peace and security, this is one  \nlesson that we have learned and intend to put into  \naction.",
    "UNSC_2005_SPV.5294_spch027.txt": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this annotation task step by step. First, I need to understand the guidelines thoroughly. The goal is to identify and label characters in the speech as Hero, Villain, Victim, or combinations. The tags should be applied to people, organizations, countries, or groups, not abstract concepts. \n\nStarting with the first paragraph: The speaker thanks several individuals and entities. According to guideline 2a, Heroes are those who help victims, increase agreement, recognize injustice, etc. The Secretary-General, Under-Secretary-General, and others like Ms. Mayanja and Ms. Heyzer are likely Heroes because they're contributing to implementing resolution 1325. So, I'll tag them with <HER>. The United Nations system-wide action plan is mentioned, but since it's a plan, not a personified entity, maybe not. The report (S/2005/636) is a document, so probably not tagged.\n\nNext, the Secretary-General's report makes recommendations for implementing resolution 1325. The resolution itself is mentioned here. Guideline 4 says to tag UNSC resolutions only if personified. In \"implementation of resolution 1325 (2000)\", it's not personified, so no tag. But later, when the resolution is discussed as providing guidance, maybe it's more active. Wait, in the example, \"Resolution 1325 calls for action\" would be tagged as Hero. Here, \"resolution 1325 (2000) which focused the international community's attention...\" might be considered personified. So I should check if the resolution is acting here. The resolution \"provided guidance\", which is a bit active. Maybe tag as Hero here. But the example says \"calls for action\" is personified. \"Provided guidance\" might be similar. So <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>.\n\nThen, the Secretariat, peacekeeping operations, Special Adviser, UNDFW, Member States are mentioned. These are all organizations or groups contributing to implementing the resolution, so Heroes. Each of these should be tagged. \"Member States\" as a group. \n\nLater, \"the international community\" is mentioned. It's a group, but is it an abstract concept? Guideline 4 says not to tag abstract concepts. \"International community\" might be considered an abstract group. But sometimes, in context, it's acting (attaches greater importance). Hmm. The example says \"French diplomacy\" is abstract. Maybe \"international community\" is abstract here. So not tagged. \n\n\"Department of Peacekeeping Operations\" is an organization, and they've mandated protection of women. So Hero. \"gender advisers\" are people, part of peacekeeping operations, so Hero.\n\nIn the High-level Plenary Meeting, \"world leaders\" are a group, acting by stressing women's role. Hero. \n\nMoving to the numbered points. First point: \"protecting women from the harm caused by war.\" Women here are victims. \"Women\" as a group. So <VIC>women</VIC>. \n\nSecond point: \"crimes of sexual assault\", \"violence against women\" \u2013 women are victims here. \"Perpetrators\" would be Villains. So \"perpetrators\" as <VIL>. \n\nThird point: \"women should be encouraged to participate...\" \u2013 here, women are both victims (primary victims) and Heroes (indispensable participants). So combined tag <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>. \n\nFourth point: \"protecting women's rights\" \u2013 women as Victims. \n\nFifth point: \"General Assembly\", \"Economic and Social Council\" as organizations contributing, so Heroes. \n\nIn the conclusion: \"mothers, wives and daughters\" are mentioned as victims (shedding tears due to war). So <VIC>. \"Sisters worldwide\" also Victims. \n\nNow, checking for overlapping tags. For example, in \"women are both the primary victims... and indispensable participants\", the entire \"women\" should be <HER_VIC>. \n\nAlso, need to ensure noun phrases are fully captured, including possessives. Like \"Secretary-General's report\" \u2013 the report isn't tagged, but the Secretary-General is. Wait, the Secretary-General was already tagged earlier. In \"Secretary-General's report\", \"Secretary-General\" is part of a possessive noun phrase. According to guideline 1c, include possessive modifiers. So \"<HER>Secretary-General</HER>'s report\".\n\nAnother example: \"peacekeeping operations\" are mentioned multiple times. When they are the ones mandated to protect women, they're Heroes. \n\nAlso, \"Security Council\" in the last point \u2013 they are coordinating, so Hero. \n\nNeed to check for combined roles. Are there any entities that are both Hero and Villain? Not obvious in this speech. Mostly Heroes and Victims. \n\nNow, applying the tags step by step in the text. Let's go through each paragraph:\n\nFirst paragraph: \n\n\"Mr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese): I wish at the outset to thank you, Mr. President, for initiating and organizing today's meeting. I thank the <HER>Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan</HER>, for his report on the United Nations system-wide action plan (S/2005/636). Our thanks go also to <HER>Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Guehenno</HER>, <HER>Ms. Rachel Mayanja</HER>, <HER>Ms. Noeleen Heyzer</HER> and other participants for their presentations this morning.\"\n\nHere, the Secretary-General, Under-Secretary-General, and the two Ms. are Heroes. \"Other participants\" \u2013 not specific, so maybe not tagged. \n\nNext paragraph:\n\n\"In his report, the <HER>Secretary-General</HER> makes many concrete recommendations for further implementation by the <HER>United Nations system</HER> of <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>. We welcome his recommendations and express the hope that they can be effectively implemented.\"\n\nHere, the Secretary-General again as Hero. \"United Nations system\" as an organization, Hero. Resolution 1325 is personified here because it's being implemented, so Hero.\n\n\"This year marks both the fifth anniversary of the adoption of <HER>Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> and the tenth anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing. Those anniversaries lend particular significance to this open debate on the question of women and peace and security.\"\n\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 is again Hero. \"Fourth World Conference on Women\" \u2013 an event, not a character, so not tagged. \"Women\" here are part of the topic, not specifically victims or heroes yet.\n\n\"Five years ago the <HER>Security Council</HER> adopted <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>, which focused the international community's attention on the question of women and armed conflict and which provided guidance for the endeavour to promote gender equality, protect women's rights and expand the role played by women. In the five years since then - thanks to the efforts of the <HER>Secretariat</HER>, the relevant <HER>peacekeeping operations</HER>, the <HER>Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women</HER>, the <HER>United Nations Development Fund for Women</HER> and <HER>Member States</HER> - much has been achieved in implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). The international community now attaches greater importance to the role of women in the settlement of armed conflicts, and the <HER>Department of Peacekeeping Operations</HER> has mandated that enhanced protection of women be a very important component of the daily work of peacekeeping operations. Both at Headquarters and in many peacekeeping operations, <HER>gender advisers</HER> have been appointed.\"\n\nSecurity Council, resolution 1325, Secretariat, peacekeeping operations, Special Adviser, UNDFW, Member States, Department of Peacekeeping Operations, gender advisers \u2013 all Heroes.\n\n\"At the recent High-level Plenary Meeting of the <HER>General Assembly</HER>, <HER>world leaders</HER> once again stressed the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peacebuilding and reaffirmed their commitment to the full and effective implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).\"\n\nGeneral Assembly and world leaders as Heroes.\n\n\"Five years on, when we look back on the road we have travelled and forward to the path ahead, we can see that a great deal of work remains to be done in attaining the goals defined in <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>.\"\n\nResolution again as Hero.\n\nFirst point: \"protecting <VIC>women</VIC> from the harm that is caused by war.\"\n\nSecond point: \"crimes of sexual assault must be punished more harshly; violence against <VIC>women</VIC> must be more seriously investigated and its <VIL>perpetrators</VIL> must be brought to justice. <HER>United Nations peacekeeping operations</HER> must continue to pursue a zero-tolerance policy to ensure strict compliance with rules and adherence to standards.\"\n\nPerpetrators as Villains, UN peacekeeping as Heroes.\n\nThird point: \"<HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> should be encouraged to participate in peace processes at all stages. In particular, it is essential to ensure that they have decision-making power so that the special needs and the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> will be reflected in conflict and post-conflict processes. <HER_VIC>Women</HER_VIC> are both the primary victims of armed conflicts of all kinds and indispensable participants in the resolution of any conflict. Their ardent yearning for peace enables them to play a more important role in the promotion of peace processes.\"\n\nWomen as both Hero and Victim.\n\nFourth point: \"protecting <VIC>women</VIC>'s rights\"\n\nFifth point: \"<HER>General Assembly</HER> and the <HER>Economic and Social Council</HER> have been considering women's issues for many years and have rich experience to offer. The <HER>Security Council</HER> should coordinate its activities with theirs.\"\n\nThese councils as Heroes.\n\n\"Women have played an important - indeed, irreplaceable - role in the formation of human civilization and the promotion of social development. Progress for <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> is progress for all of humankind. A popular Chinese saying has it that <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> hold up half of the sky. We hope that, through our common efforts, <VIC>mothers, wives and daughters</VIC> will no longer shed their tears at the horrors of war and that all our <VIC>sisters worldwide</VIC> will lead happy and peaceful lives. We believe that our world will then be a brighter and more beautiful place.\"\n\nHere, women are Heroes for their role and Victims for the suffering. \"Mothers, wives, daughters\" and \"sisters worldwide\" as Victims.\n\nI need to ensure that all noun phrases are captured correctly, including possessives and full NPs. Also check for any overlapping tags. For example, in the third point, \"women\" is tagged as HER_VIC each time. \n\nAlso, check if \"peacekeeping personnel\" are mentioned anywhere as villains. In the example given, peacekeeping personnel were part of a villain group. In this speech, peacekeeping operations are Heroes. So no villain tag there.\n\nFinally, ensure that combined tags are used where necessary and that nesting is done correctly if there are overlaps. In this speech, there don't seem to be nested tags, but women are sometimes both Hero and Victim, hence HER_VIC.\n</think>\n\n<HER>Mr. Wang Guangya (China)</HER> (spoke in Chinese):  \nI wish at the outset to thank you, <HER>Mr. President</HER>, for initiating and organizing today's meeting.

    "UNSC_2010_SPV.6411_spch053.txt": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this annotation task step by step. First, I need to read through the entire speech carefully to identify all the characters mentioned, which include people, organizations, countries, and groups. Then, based on the guidelines, I have to label each as Hero, Villain, Victim, or a combination.\n\nStarting with the first paragraph: The speaker thanks Uganda for convening the debate. Uganda is an organization/country taking initiative, so likely a Hero. The Secretary-General, Under-Secretary-General Bachelet, and other guests are mentioned. These are individuals in roles that help promote gender equality, so Heroes. Slovenia aligns with the EU and Costa Rica (Human Security Network), which are organizations working towards positive goals, so Heroes.\n\nResolution 1325 is mentioned as acknowledging women's roles beyond being victims. Since the resolution is personified here (\"acknowledged\"), it should be tagged as a Hero. Women are described as not just victims but participants, so they might be both Hero and Victim. However, in the phrase \"women are not just victims of armed conflict,\" the victims part is explicitly mentioned, so \"women\" here are Victim and Hero? Wait, the resolution acknowledges they are not just victims, so maybe Hero because they're participating. But the context also mentions their victimhood. Hmm, maybe \"women\" here are both Victim and Hero. But according to the guidelines, if specific entities are mentioned, like women, they should be tagged. So \"women\" as Victim when they are referred to as victims, but also Hero when their participation is highlighted. The sentence says \"women are not just victims... their equal and full participation is vital.\" So \"women\" here are both Victim (as they are victims of conflict) and Hero (as participants). So combined tag HER_VIC.\n\nNext, in the following paragraphs: \"protection of women\" \u2013 women as Victim. \"Violence against women... sexual violence\" \u2013 women as Victim. \"Democratic Republic of the Congo\" \u2013 where women are targeted, so DRC might be a location, but the perpetrators are parties in the conflict. The parties causing violence would be Villains. However, DRC is mentioned as the place where events happened, but the actual villains are the parties responsible. The report by the Secretary-General (Hero) discusses UN activities. The Secretary-General is a Hero. The international community needs coordination, so \"international community\" as Hero? Or is that an abstract concept? The guidelines say not to tag abstract concepts. \"International community\" is a group, so maybe Hero. Slovenia supports recommendations, so Slovenia is Hero. The Security Council imposing sanctions on perpetrators \u2013 perpetrators are Villains. \"Perpetrators of violations\" \u2013 VIL. Member States developing action plans \u2013 Hero. Slovenia adopting an action plan \u2013 Hero. Gender equality in Slovenia's policies \u2013 Hero. The Security Council again as Hero for addressing women's issues. The United Nations approach \u2013 Hero. Member States \u2013 Hero.\n\nWait, need to check each entity against the role definitions. Heroes help victims, increase agreement, etc. Victims suffer harm. Villains cause harm.\n\nSo, \"women\" in contexts of being victims of violence are VIC. When they participate, they're HER. But in the sentence where it's said they are not just victims but participants, maybe both tags. But the example in guidelines says if a role term like \"victim\" is used with a specific entity, tag it. Here, \"women are not just victims\" \u2013 \"victims\" is a role term, but the entity is \"women\", so \"women\" would be VIC here. But the following clause says their participation is vital, so maybe HER as well. So combined HER_VIC.\n\nSimilarly, \"perpetrators of violations\" are VIL. \"Parties to a conflict responsible for grave violations\" \u2013 VIL. \"Security Council\" when taking action is HER. \"Slovenia\" as taking actions is HER. \"Secretary-General\" \u2013 HER. \"United Nations\" \u2013 HER. \"Human Security Network\" \u2013 HER. \"European Union\" \u2013 HER. \"Costa Rica\" \u2013 HER. \"Democratic Republic of the Congo\" as the location where events happen, but the villains are the parties causing violence there. So \"Democratic Republic of the Congo\" itself isn't a villain unless it's the government, but the text says \"events in DRC have shown women are targets\", so the villains are the perpetrators within DRC, which are not explicitly named, so maybe not tagged. Instead, \"parties to a conflict\" later mentioned are VIL.\n\nAlso, \"sanctions committees\" \u2013 part of the UN, so HER? Or just a mechanism. Probably not tagged unless they are personified. The text says \"impose measures against parties\", so the parties are VIL.\n\nIn the part about sexual violence being a priority in Council resolutions, the Council is HER.\n\nWhen the speaker mentions Slovenia's actions, like adopting an action plan, Slovenia is HER. \"Gender equality in security and defense policy\" \u2013 Slovenia as HER.\n\nThe final paragraph encourages the Security Council (HER) and mentions Member States (HER) and the United Nations (HER). \"Plight of women\" \u2013 women as VIC.\n\nNow, applying the tags:\n\nFirst paragraph: Uganda (HER), Secretary-General (HER), Bachelet (HER), other guests (HER). Slovenia (HER), EU (HER), Costa Rica (HER), Human Security Network (HER).\n\nResolution 1325 (HER) as it's personified. Women as HER_VIC.\n\nLater mentions of women as victims: VIC. Perpetrators as VIL. Parties to conflict as VIL. Security Council as HER. Secretary-General's report (HER). International community (HER). Slovenia (HER). Sanctions committees (HER? Maybe not, since they're part of the UN structure but not personified. The text says \"impose measures\", so the Council is HER, the parties are VIL.\n\n\"Member States\" developing plans \u2013 HER. Slovenia again HER. \"Security and defence sector\" in Slovenia \u2013 HER. \"Security Council\" in the end \u2013 HER.\n\nNow, checking for nested tags. For example, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo part: \"women continue to be deliberate targets...\" \u2013 women as VIC. The perpetrators are not explicitly named, so maybe just VIC here.\n\nAnother point: \"the fragmentation of those activities demonstrates the need to streamline and coordinate the action of all members of the international community.\" International community is a group, so HER.\n\nAlso, \"targeted and graduated measures against all parties to a conflict responsible for grave violations of women's rights\" \u2013 parties as VIL, women's rights being violated, so women as VIC.\n\nIn the example given, when women are both victims and heroes, use HER_VIC. So in the initial mention where they're not just victims but participants, HER_VIC. Later when they're victims of violence, VIC.\n\nPutting it all together with tags. Let me go through each paragraph:\n\n\"Mr. Zidar (Slovenia): I would like to thank <HER>Uganda</HER> for the initiative to convene this important open debate on <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>, peace and security. I also thank <HER>the Secretary-General</HER>, <HER>Under-Secretary-General for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women Bachelet</HER> and other distinguished guests for their presentations today.\n\n<HER>Slovenia</HER> fully aligns itself with the statements to be delivered by <HER>the representative of the European Union</HER> and by <HER>the representative of Costa Rica</HER> on behalf of <HER>the Human Security Network</HER>.\n\n<HER>Resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> on <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>, peace and security acknowledged that <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> are not just victims of armed conflict and that their equal and full participation is of vital importance in conflict prevention, peacekeeping, conflict resolution, peacebuilding and post-conflict recovery.\n\nIn the past 10 years, many activities have been carried out to strengthen the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> during and after conflict. However, this anniversary reminds us that despite those efforts, much needs to be done in the protection of <VIC>women</VIC> and in the promotion of the participation of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> at the decision-making level, in conflict resolution and in peace processes.\n\nViolence against <VIC>women</VIC>, especially sexual and gender-based violence, persists in conflicts. Recent events in <VIC>the Democratic Republic of the Congo</VIC> have shown that <VIC>women</VIC> continue to be deliberate targets of injustice and sexual violence in the conflict and its aftermath.\n\nIn his report (S/2010/498), <HER>the Secretary-General</HER> takes up <HER>United Nations</HER> activities in the implementation of <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>. The report shows that a vast range of activities has been carried out in the past 10 years. However, the fragmentation of those activities demonstrates the need to streamline and coordinate the action of <HER>all members of the international community</HER>. <HER>Slovenia</HER> supports <HER>the Secretary-General's</HER> recommendation to develop a single comprehensive framework that consists of an agreed set of goals, targets and indicators to guide the implementation of the resolution in its second decade.\n\nWe are of the opinion that the issue of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>, peace and security needs to be addressed in a holistic and comprehensive manner. We welcome <HER>the Security Council's</HER> decision to take forward the set of indicators developed by <HER>the Secretary-General</HER> to track the implementation of <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> in situations of armed conflict as well as post-conflict and other situations. We hope that the indicators will now become operational.\n\n<HER>Slovenia</HER> also supports the recommendation to establish a dedicated working group to review progress in the implementation of <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> and to make recommendations to <HER>the Security Council</HER> on how to address gaps and challenges to accelerate progress in the implementation of the resolution.\n\nStronger steps should be taken to address accountability and to end impunity for <VIL>perpetrators of violations</VIL>. <HER>The Security Council</HER> should impose targeted and graduated measures against <VIL>all parties to a conflict</VIL> responsible for grave violations of <VIC>women's</VIC> rights, including sexual violence. Sexual violence should be a priority element in all <HER>Council</HER> resolutions mandating <HER>the sanctions committees</HER>.\n\nWe all have a responsibility to implement <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>. The development of national action plans is a key means by which <HER>Member States</HER> commit themselves to fulfilling that responsibility. I would like to report that <HER>Slovenia</HER> is about to finalize and adopt such an action plan. The goal is to interconnect existing national and international activities addressing a broader concept of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>, peace and security in order to translate them into genuine political commitments, and thus accelerate the implementation of <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> and contribute to the empowerment and protection of <VIC>women</VIC>.\n\nIn <HER>Slovenia</HER>, gender equality is a priority not only in the field of human rights and development cooperation but also in security and defence policy. Since 2008, much has been done to promote gender equality in the security and defence sector. Those activities range from awareness-raising and training to the adoption and modification of legislation and other measures, including codes of conduct. The recently adopted strategy on the participation of <HER>the Republic of Slovenia</HER> in international operations and missions promotes equal opportunities with regard to such efforts at all levels, irrespective of gender.\n\nLastly, let me take this opportunity to encourage <HER>the Security Council</HER> to continue to address the issue of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>, peace and security and to seek the most effective means to improve the situation of <VIC>women</VIC> in armed conflict. With a comprehensive <HER>United Nations</HER> approach and increased ownership by <HER>Member States</HER> over their activities, the plight of <VIC>women</VIC> in situations of armed conflict and its aftermath can be eliminated.\"\n\nWait, in the part about the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the text says \"Recent events in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have shown that women continue to be deliberate targets...\" Here, the DRC is the location, but the women are victims. So \"Democratic Republic of the Congo\" is a country, but are they a villain? The events there show women are targeted, but the villains are the perpetrators (parties to the conflict), not the country itself. So DRC is not a villain, just the context where it happens. So \"Democratic Republic of the Congo\" should not be tagged as a villain. Instead, the women are victims. So the correct tag would be \"<VIC>women</VIC>\" in that sentence. The mention of DRC is just a location, so no tag.\n\nAlso, in the sentence \"the protection of women\", women are victims (VIC). In \"promotion of the participation of women\", they're HER_VIC. But the guidelines say if they're both, use combined tags. So when women are referred to in a context that includes both their victimhood and participation, use HER_VIC. When they're only victims (e.g., targets of violence), use VIC.\n\nAnother check: \"perpetrators of violations\" \u2013 VIL. \"all parties to a conflict responsible for grave violations\" \u2013 VIL. \"women's rights\" \u2013 VIC.\n\nIn the final paragraph, \"plight of women\" \u2013 VIC.\n\nI think that covers all entities. Now, making sure all tags are correctly applied according to the guidelines, especially regarding combined roles and nested tags. Since there's no instance where a villain contains a victim within the same noun phrase, but women are sometimes victims within the context of villains' actions. However, in the example given, the Democratic Republic of the Congo isn't a villain, so no nested tags there.\n\nAnother point: \"United Nations\" is an organization, so tagged as HER when they're acting. \"Secretary-General\" as a person is HER. \"Security Council\" as an organization is HER. \"Human Security Network\" \u2013 HER. \"European Union\" \u2013 HER. \"Costa Rica\" \u2013 HER. \"Slovenia\" \u2013 HER. \"Member States\" \u2013 HER. \"sanctions committees\" \u2013 part of the UN, so HER.\n\nI think that's all. Now, applying the tags as per the above analysis.\n</think>\n\n\u201cMr. Zidar (<HER>Slovenia</HER>): I would like to thank <HER>Uganda</HER> for the initiative to convene this important open debate on <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>, peace and security.

    "UNSC_2014_SPV.7289_spch006.txt": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this annotation task step by step. First, I need to understand the guidelines thoroughly. The goal is to identify characters (people, organizations, countries, groups) in the speech and label them as Hero, Villain, Victim, or combinations. The tags need to be applied to entire noun phrases, including modifiers and possessive cases. Also, overlapping annotations should be nested when necessary.\n\nStarting with the first paragraph: The speaker thanks the Permanent Mission of Argentina and other Security Council members. According to the guidelines, organizations like the Permanent Mission and Security Council are entities to tag. Since they're holding a debate on displaced women and girls, which is part of the women and peace and security agenda, they're likely Heroes because they're addressing critical issues. The displaced women and girls are Victims here.\n\nNext, the speaker mentions his mandate involves dialogue with Governments and the international community. Governments and international community are groups. The mandate's purpose is to protect IDPs, so the speaker's role is Hero. The international community here is also a Hero as they're part of the protective efforts.\n\nIn field missions to countries like Kenya, Azerbaijan, etc., these countries are mentioned as places visited. But unless they're portrayed in a specific role, maybe not tagged. However, the international community is again mentioned as part of an early warning system through bodies like the Human Rights Council, General Assembly, and Security Council. These are organizations acting as Heroes since they're part of the protective framework.\n\nThe speaker thanks UN agencies like OHCHR, UNHCR, OCHA. These are organizations supporting his mandate, so Heroes. Member States supporting IDP protection are Heroes as well. Chile and Argentina co-chaired a meeting on IDP protection, so they're Heroes.\n\nThe speech then discusses the number of IDPs, especially women and girls as Victims. The Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and resolutions like 1325 are mentioned. Since the guidelines say to tag UNSC resolutions if personified, resolution 1325 is a Hero here. The Guiding Principles are also Heroes as they inform protections.\n\nThe African Union Kampala Convention is an organization, so Hero. The report to the Human Rights Council is part of the mandate's work, so the Council is a Hero.\n\nIn discussing the challenges faced by displaced women, they are clearly Victims. The perpetrators causing displacement (armed conflict, generalized violence) are Villains, but the text doesn't explicitly name them. Instead, it refers to \"those who commit crimes\" indirectly. However, the speech mainly focuses on the victims and the heroes helping them. When the speaker mentions women being targeted in armed conflict, the armed groups are Villains, but they aren't named. Since the entities to tag are people, organizations, countries, groups, and if the group is implied (like perpetrators), but here it's more abstract. Maybe not tag unless explicitly mentioned.\n\nThe part where displaced women face double discrimination as IDPs and women: they are Victims. The mention of urban displacement leading to vulnerability again highlights women and girls as Victims. Sri Lanka is a country mentioned, but unless it's acting as a Villain or Hero, maybe not. The example given is about IDP women lacking documentation, so Sri Lanka isn't tagged here.\n\nIn the conclusion, the speaker talks about States needing to build capacity. States here are entities but their role is mixed\u2014some lack frameworks, so maybe not Heroes, but the call is for them to act. However, since they're being urged to improve, maybe not tagged unless they're explicitly acting. The resilience of IDP women in Ukraine is mentioned; Ukraine is a country, but the women are Victims and Heroes for volunteering. So combined tag HER_VIC.\n\nThroughout, I need to ensure that noun phrases are fully captured, including possessives. For example, \"my mandate\" includes the possessive, so tag as HER. Also, check for combined roles. When women are both victims and heroes (e.g., participating in peace), use HER_VIC.\n\nNow, applying tags:\n\n- \"Permanent Mission of Argentina\" and \"Security Council\" as HER.\n- \"displaced women and girls\" as VIC.\n- \"Governments\" and \"international community\" as HER.\n- \"Kenya, Azerbaijan, Cote d'Ivoire, Haiti and Ukraine\" as countries but not tagged unless acting. Since they're places of missions, maybe not.\n- \"Human Rights Council, the General Assembly, and... Security Council\" as HER.\n- \"United Nations agencies... OHCHR, UNHCR, OCHA\" as HER.\n- \"Member States\" as HER.\n- \"Chile and Argentina\" as HER.\n- \"33.3 million internally displaced persons\" as VIC.\n- \"women and girls\" as VIC.\n- \"resolution 1325 (2000)\" as HER.\n- \"Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement\" as HER.\n- \"Pact on Security... Great Lakes Region\" and \"African Union Kampala Convention\" as HER.\n- \"internally displaced women\" as VIC.\n- \"IDPs\" as VIC when referring to them as displaced.\n- \"perpetrators\" of violence are implied but not named, so not tagged.\n- \"displaced women\" as VIC, and when they take on roles like volunteers, HER_VIC.\n- \"States\" when mentioned in lacking capacity, but since they're being urged to act, maybe not tagged unless they're part of the solution. The text says \"States should take measures,\" so perhaps HER as they're called to action.\n- \"IDP women in Ukraine\" as HER_VIC.\n\nNeed to be careful with overlapping tags. For example, when women are both victims and heroes, use HER_VIC. Also, ensure that lists of entities sharing the same role are tagged as a single NP.\n\nFinally, check for entities not to tag: abstract concepts like \"resilience\" aren't tagged. Laws or treaties only if personified. Here, resolutions and conventions are tagged as Heroes because they're personified as taking action.\n</think>\n\n<HER>Mr. Beyani</HER>: I would like to thank <HER>the Permanent Mission of Argentina</HER> and <HER>the other members of the Security Council</HER> for holding this open debate on the critical issue of <VIC>displaced women and girls</VIC> in the framework of <HER>the women and peace and security agenda</HER>. The intersection of peace and security, human rights and development is critical to dealing with the issue of internal displacement. We must not lose sight of the important role that <HER_VIC>internally displaced women</HER_VIC> can play in negotiating peace, ensuring their human rights and bringing about development in post-conflict situations.\n\nAs part of <HER>my mandate</HER>, I enter into dialogue with <HER>Governments</HER> and <HER>the international community</HER> alike to advise on and advocate for the best possible protection of <VIC>internally displaced persons (IDPs)</VIC>, and in all my field missions I pay specific attention to the protection of <VIC>internally displaced women and girls</VIC>. This year alone, I have carried out missions to Kenya, Azerbaijan, Cote d'Ivoire, Haiti and Ukraine. Such field missions are significant in that they provide an early warning system for <HER>the international community</HER> through <HER>the Human Rights Council</HER>, <HER>the General Assembly</HER> and, in this instance, <HER>the Security Council itself</HER> on the actual causes, conditions and situations of displacement.\n\n<HER>My mandate</HER> receives specific support from <HER>United Nations agencies and entities</HER>, in particular <HER>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights</HER>, <HER>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</HER> and <HER>the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</HER>, and I am grateful for their support and great collaboration. <HER>My work</HER> could not be possible without the outstanding support extended by <HER>Member States</HER>, both those working to cope with and to protect <VIC>IDPs</VIC> and those supporting action to improve the lives of <VIC>internally displaced persons</VIC> internationally. I am grateful for the ever-growing cooperation extended by <HER>States</HER> to <HER>my mandate</HER>. I would also like to highlight <HER>the Arria Formula meeting</HER> in May on the protection of <VIC>IDPs</VIC>, co-chaired by <HER>Chile</HER> and <HER>Argentina</HER>, which I had the privilege to address and during which the issue of internal displacement and threats to international peace and security were tackled.\n\nWe started 2014 with an unprecedented peak in the number of <VIC>persons forcibly displaced within their own countries</VIC> due to armed conflict, generalized violence or human rights violations - <VIC>33.3 million internally displaced persons</VIC>, the highest figure ever recorded. In many countries, <VIC>IDPs</VIC> are also displaced by natural disasters, further compounding existing vulnerabilities. <VIC>Women and girls</VIC> account for some half of the world's <VIC>IDP population</VIC>.\n\nSince the 1990s, greater attention has been paid to the rights and needs of <VIC>women and girls</VIC> in emergency and post-conflict situations and to promoting gender-sensitive approaches in humanitarian, development and early recovery response. A wide range of resolutions - for instance, <HER>the landmark resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> - but also policies, gender-mainstreaming efforts and targeted programmes have been adopted in this regard, and they have increasingly encompassed <VIC>internally displaced women and girls</VIC>.\n\n<HER>The 1998 Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement</HER>, which detail the specific rights of <VIC>internally displaced women and girls</VIC>, have been recognized by <HER>the General Assembly</HER> and in <HER>Security Council resolutions</HER>. <HER>The Guiding Principles</HER> have informed the inclusion of concrete and progressive provisions on <VIC>internally displaced women</VIC> in subsequent instruments, such as <HER>the 2006 Pact on Security, Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region</HER> and <HER>the 2009 African Union Kampala Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa</HER>. In 2013, I dedicated <HER>my thematic report</HER> to <HER>the Human Rights Council</HER> to the situation of <VIC>internally displaced women</VIC>, and during this debate I would like to draw to the attention of <HER>the Security Council</HER> to that report.\n\nDespite such positive developments, responses to internal displacement still do not adequately address the specific concerns and roles of <VIC>women and girls</VIC>. During situations of conflict and violence, <VIC>women and girls</VIC> flee to escape arbitrary killings, rape, torture, inhumane or degrading treatment or starvation. They may have been <VIC>the victims of such violations themselves</VIC> or seen <VIC>their loved ones</VIC> attacked and abused. The experience of <HER>my mandate</HER> is that <VIC>women and girls</VIC> are targeted as a means of armed conflict - to destroy and humiliate communities, to manipulate the demographic composition of communities, for sexual slavery including enforced concubinage, and at times enforced sterilization. As <VIC>IDPs</VIC>, <VIC>women</VIC> experience the various human rights challenges that are characteristic to displacement situations and that often place <VIC>IDPs</VIC> at greater risk than other affected populations. Such challenges include the loss of livelihoods and key documentation, as well as the lack of effective access to a number of important rights and services.\n\nIn addition, <VIC>internally displaced women</VIC> often face double discrimination, based on being both <VIC>an IDP</VIC> and <VIC>a woman</VIC>, and experience human rights challenges due to the intersection of gender with other factors such as age, group affiliation such as minority status, disability and civil or socioeconomic situations. <VIC>Displaced women</VIC> often have to assume new gender roles that further expose them to gender-based violence, including physical violence and trafficking. Those roles include being the only breadwinners and taking on the increased burden of care for extended families. <VIC>Internally displaced women</VIC> risk their lives, safety and physical integrity to protect <VIC>their husbands and families</VIC>. They have told me, \"If we let <VIC>their husbands and male children</VIC> fetch firewood, food or water, <VIC>they</VIC> will be killed, whereas <VIC>we</VIC> may be raped but spared death\".\n\nOther specific protection concerns for <VIC>internally displaced women</VIC> include inequitable access to assistance and psychosocial support, education, training and livelihoods; poor reproductive health care; and exclusion from decision-making processes. The fact that more <VIC>IDPs</VIC> tend to live in urban rather than camp or rural settings also raises additional challenges that have detrimental impacts on <VIC>women and girls</VIC>. I first visited Cote d'Ivoire a year after the end of the post-electoral violence. Many <VIC>IDPs</VIC> had found refuge in urban areas, including <VIC>girls who had been impregnated during displacement</VIC> and could not go back to their communities as a result. However, the inability of <VIC>IDPs</VIC> to continue renting their shelters in those urban centres, once the cash grant they received to enable them to stay in urban areas ran out, pushed <VIC>the most vulnerable communities, including women and girls</VIC>, to the outskirts of the city. Many <VIC>displaced women and girls</VIC>, particularly those belonging to minorities, are at risk of statelessness.\n\nPre-existing patterns of discrimination in many of those contexts are exacerbated during conflict and contribute to violations of <VIC>women's</VIC> rights to housing, land and property. For instance, during my visit to Sri Lanka, I was struck by the fact that many <VIC>IDP women</VIC> either lacked proper documentation to their land or had documents in the name of <VIC>their deceased husbands or fathers</VIC>, preventing them from accessing their land.\n\nTo respond to those intricate problems with far-reaching consequences, we need to look at long-term solutions. Displacement is not just a humanitarian issue, but also an issue of building peace, and constitutes a long-term development challenge with profound political, economic, environmental and security implications. If left unaddressed, protracted displacement generates further marginalization, inequality, fragility and vulnerability and erodes <VIC>women's</VIC> resilience.\n\nDisplacement can overwhelm the institutional capacities of <HER>affected States</HER>, which are already dealing with major conflicts or disasters. Many <HER>States</HER> have neither policy frameworks or coordination systems in place to respond to internal displacement, nor a set of procedures to bring quick assistance to <VIC>populations made extremely vulnerable from one day to another</VIC> as they have lost livelihoods, social protection and have gone through traumatic experiences. <HER>States</HER> also lack comprehensive <VIC>IDP</VIC> registration systems by age and gender.\n\nMore needs to be done if we are to respond adequately to the specific protection concerns of <VIC>IDP women</VIC>. Data collection disaggregated by sex, age, location and other key indicators is critical for effective advocacy and the development of programmes to respond to the specific needs of <VIC>IDP women</VIC> at all stages of displacement, irrespective of the cause of displacement. <HER>National and international efforts</HER> to collect, update, analyse and disseminate both quantitative and qualitative data on <VIC>IDPs</VIC>, including those outside of camps, displacement-affected communities and communities at risk of displacement should be strengthened.\n\nA more preventive approach to sexual and gender-based violence in the context of internal displacement is also essential. In that regard, gender-sensitive training should be provided more systematically to <HER>police and military forces</HER>, <HER>judiciary personnel</HER> and <HER>social workers</HER>. A stronger focus on prevention is also required within the households and communities of <VIC>the internally displaced</VIC>, including engaging <HER>men and boys</HER> in those prevention and protection efforts. <HER>States</HER> should take all measures to combat impunity for sexual and gender-based violence, including by investigating and holding <VIL>perpetrators</VIL> accountable. Efforts to reduce exposure to sexual violence also entails ensuring that <VIC>survivors</VIC> have access to appropriate support, including reproductive health care and psychosocial services.\n\nEnsuring access to justice and accountability mechanisms is key when addressing internal displacement with a gender lens. In addition to promoting access to criminal and civil justice systems for <VIC>IDP women</VIC>, it is also essential to consider how their concerns can be addressed through transitional justice measures such as <HER>truth and reconciliation commissions</HER> and reparations. <HER>Donor accountability</HER> for gender-equality programming for <VIC>IDPs</VIC> is essential and entails more effective integration of gender issues into donor practices.\n\nI was heartened by the resilience of <HER_VIC>IDP women I met in Ukraine</HER_VIC>. Many of them were volunteering to help <VIC>other displaced persons</VIC>. Meaningful participation by <HER_VIC>IDP women and girls</HER_VIC> in the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of laws, policies, programmes and activities that affect their lives at all stages of displacement is key in the response to internal displacement. <HER_VIC>IDP women</HER_VIC>, as individuals, have the right to make free and informed decisions concerning the resolution of their displacement on the basis of adequate and appropriately communicated information, participate fully in building peace and in planning and management of their return, local integration or resettlement elsewhere. The participation and leadership of <HER_VIC>IDP women</HER_VIC> in finding durable solutions that address their very specific concerns is critical.\n\nI would like to thank again <HER>Argentina</HER> for the opportunity to address <HER>the Security Council</HER> today.",
    "UNSC_2017_SPV.8079_spch078.txt": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this annotation task step by step. First, I need to read through the entire speech carefully to understand the context and identify the entities mentioned. The goal is to label each relevant character as Hero, Villain, Victim, or a combination, based on the guidelines provided.\n\nStarting with the first paragraph: The speaker is Mr. Hilale from Morocco, addressing the Security Council. He thanks France for organizing the debate. According to the guidelines, delegations can be Heroes if they are taking positive actions. \"My delegation\" is mentioned here, so I should check if they fit the Hero criteria. Since they're participating in a debate on an important issue and contributing to the discussion, they might be Heroes. Also, \"France\" is mentioned as organizing the debate, which could be a Hero role for facilitating important discussions.\n\nNext, \"Morocco\" is mentioned in relation to the issue of women and peace, which is of utmost importance. Since Morocco is actively involved and organizing conferences, they might be Heroes. Then, resolution 1325 (2000) is discussed. The guidelines say to tag UNSC resolutions as Heroes if they are personified. Here, it's referred to as having \"represented international recognition\" and contributing to peace efforts, so resolution 1325 should be a Hero.\n\nMoving on, \"women\" are mentioned both as victims and agents of change. The speech says they are not only victims but also essential players. So \"women\" here might be both Victim and Hero. The guidelines allow combined tags, so <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> would be appropriate here.\n\nThe next paragraph talks about women's participation in negotiations increasing peace sustainability. The UN-Women-led study is cited, so \"UN-Women\" is an organization contributing positively, making them Heroes. The study's findings support women's roles, reinforcing their Hero aspect.\n\nMorocco organized an international conference, which is an action contributing to peace, so \"Morocco\" again as Hero. The \"international community\" is mentioned in a consensus context, working towards strengthening women's roles, so that's a Hero. The \"United Nations\" is committed to inclusion and gender equality, so Hero tag here.\n\nThe conference's focus areas include mediation, deradicalization, and preventing sexual violence. The regional centre created in Rabat is a think-tank for women's roles in peacekeeping. This centre is an organization contributing to peace, so Hero. The Security Council's priorities in promoting women's empowerment are mentioned, so Security Council as Hero.\n\nIn the next section, \"women and girls\" have special needs post-conflict, making them Victims. They are underrepresented in decision-making, which fits the Victim criteria. However, the text also discusses their necessary participation, which might imply a Hero aspect, but since the focus here is on their underrepresentation and needs, Victim seems more accurate here.\n\nThe Kingdom of Morocco commends UN-Women's work, so both are Heroes. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, particularly Goal 16, is mentioned as promoting peace and inclusion. Since it's a plan and not a personified entity, maybe not tagged. But the Agenda advocates for gender inclusion, which might make it a Hero. However, the guidelines say to avoid abstract concepts unless personified. The Agenda is an abstract concept, so perhaps not tagged. The Goals are interconnected with gender, peace, etc., but again, they might be abstract.\n\nThroughout the speech, entities like \"women,\" \"Morocco,\" \"UN-Women,\" \"Security Council,\" \"United Nations,\" and specific resolutions are the main characters. Each needs to be checked against the role definitions. Victims are those suffering or excluded, so women in certain contexts. Villains are absent here since the speech focuses on positive actions and challenges rather than antagonists. So most tags will be Hero or Hero combined with Victim where women are both agents and victims.\n\nNeed to ensure that noun phrases are fully captured, including possessives and modifiers. For example, \"my delegation\" includes the possessive, so tagged as Hero. Also, check for combined roles where applicable, like women being both Hero and Victim.\n\nNow, applying the tags step by step through the speech:\n\n- \"Mr. Hilale (Morocco)\" \u2013 person, but not sure if tagged unless he's acting as a Hero. Since he's representing Morocco and contributing positively, maybe Morocco is the Hero here. The guidelines say to tag countries, so \"Morocco\" as Hero.\n\n- \"my delegation\" \u2013 Hero.\n\n- \"France\" \u2013 Hero for organizing the debate.\n\n- \"resolution 1325 (2000)\" \u2013 Hero as it's personified in the context of recognition.\n\n- \"women\" as both victims and agents \u2013 HER_VIC.\n\n- \"UN-Women\" \u2013 Hero for leading studies and promoting resolutions.\n\n- \"Morocco\" again when organizing the conference \u2013 Hero.\n\n- \"international community\" \u2013 Hero for consensus.\n\n- \"United Nations\" \u2013 Hero.\n\n- \"regional centre\" in Rabat \u2013 Hero as an organization.\n\n- \"Security Council\" \u2013 Hero.\n\n- \"women and girls\" in post-conflict \u2013 Victim.\n\n- \"Kingdom of Morocco\" \u2013 Hero.\n\n- \"UN-Women\" again \u2013 Hero.\n\n- \"2030 Agenda\" \u2013 possibly not tagged as it's an abstract concept.\n\n- \"Sustainable Development Goal 16\" \u2013 same as above.\n\nEach mention needs to be checked against the guidelines. Avoid tagging abstract concepts. Only tag entities like people, organizations, countries, groups. Laws or treaties only if personified. Resolution 1325 is personified here (\"represented international recognition\"), so Hero. The 2030 Agenda is mentioned in the context of advocacy but is an abstract plan, so not tagged.\n\nAlso, check for overlapping mentions. For example, when women are mentioned as agents and victims, use HER_VIC. When they are victims in post-conflict, just VIC.\n\nFinally, ensure that the tags are properly nested if there are overlaps. In this speech, overlaps might not be frequent, but need to check. For example, if a larger NP includes a tagged entity within it. But in this case, most entities are separate.\n\nSo, compiling all these considerations into the annotated text as per the guidelines.\n</think>\n\n<HER>Mr. Hilale (Morocco)</HER> (spoke in French): First of all, <HER>my delegation</HER> would like to thank <HER>France</HER> for organizing this open debate during its presidency of the <HER>Security Council</HER>, on an issue that is of the utmost importance to <HER>Morocco</HER> - <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and peace and security.  \n\nThe historic adoption of <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> represented international recognition of the role played by <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peace and security, not only as victims but also as agents of change and essential players in restoring, maintaining and consolidating peace. Maintaining peace and security requires the integration of the gender perspective into all peace efforts, in accordance with the provisions of <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> and the other resolutions that followed in that regard.  \n\n<HER_VIC>Women</HER_VIC>'s participation in negotiation processes increases the chances of settling conflicts and sustaining peace. That finding was confirmed by a <HER>UN-Women</HER>-led global study in 2015, which revealed that the presence of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peace negotiations promoted the sustainability of peace agreements, and that 35 per cent of agreements negotiated by <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> lasted more than 15 years. That means that the presence of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peace negotiations is a great help for the sustainability of peace agreements.  \n\nOn 7 September, 2016, <HER>Morocco</HER> organized an international conference on the topic of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and peace and security. It contributed to the international debate on the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peace processes and the implementation of national plans of action to promote collective action on implementing <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>. It was an occasion to reaffirm the <HER>international community</HER>'s consensus on the need to strengthen <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>'s participation in negotiations and agreements concerning the settlement of conflicts and peacebuilding, as well as to renew the <HER>United Nations</HER> commitment to the issue of the inclusion of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and gender equality in all peacebuilding and conflict-prevention strategies.  \n\nDuring the conference, debates focused on three areas: the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in mediation and conflict-prevention processes, the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in deradicalization and the lessons learned and best practices in the prevention of sexual violence in conflict. At the conference, <HER>my country</HER> announced the creation in Rabat of an independent regional centre, a think-tank, dedicated to studying the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peacekeeping operations and their contribution to the achievement of sustainable development. The centre could serve as a space for reflection, a think-tank and a source of independent thought regarding the role and place of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations in conflict zones. It is in keeping with the priorities of the <HER>Security Council</HER> in promoting <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>'s empowerment and gender equality in the establishment of peace and international security, the dissemination of the culture of peace, ensuring access to justice and the protection of civil rights.  \n\n<VIC>Women and girls</VIC> have special needs in the post-conflict period, such as health services, livelihood, land rights and property rights and employment. They must also participate in decision-making and the development of national strategies for post-conflict economic recovery. Unfortunately, <VIC>women</VIC> are often underrepresented in the decision-making process associated with economic recovery and public governance in the post-conflict phase. They are not included in formal decision-making structures, including key economic sectors, such as infrastructure, extractive industries and commercial agriculture. To that end, the preparation of an approach based on gender and development in a post-conflict context is imperative in order to ensure that, from the beginning of the reconstruction process, there is sustainable and equitable development where both <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and men share resources, opportunities, decision-making and power.  \n\nIn that context, the <HER>Kingdom of Morocco</HER> takes this opportunity to commend the work of <HER>UN-Women</HER> to promote the implementation of the <HER>Security Council</HER> resolutions on <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and peace and security, particularly with regard to economic recovery and reconstruction through the three areas of intervention: post-conflict planning, economic recovery and governance restoration.  \n\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has placed great emphasis on peace, including the prevention of conflict and the elimination of its root causes through Sustainable Development Goal 16, which seeks to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.  \n\nThe universal 2030 Agenda, which advocates a cross-cutting incorporation of gender in all Sustainable Development Goals, emphasizes the need to redouble efforts to prevent conflict and help countries emerging from conflict, while ensuring that <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> are involved in peacekeeping and reconstruction. In that sense, the Goals demonstrate that gender, peace, security and development are interconnected, interrelated and inseparable from one another."
