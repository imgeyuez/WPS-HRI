    "UNSC_2000_SPV.4208_spch004.txt": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this annotation task step by step. First, I need to read through the entire speech carefully to understand the context and the entities mentioned. The speaker is Ms. King, the Special Adviser on Gender Issues, addressing the UN Security Council about women's roles in peace and security.\n\nStarting with the guidelines, I need to identify characters (people, organizations, countries, groups, and personified UN resolutions) and label them as Hero, Villain, Victim, or combinations. The key is to focus on how the speaker portrays these entities, not external knowledge.\n\nLooking at the first paragraph: \"Ms. King: I am particularly honoured today, as Special Adviser on Gender Issues...\" Since the instruction says not to tag the speaker at the beginning separated by a colon, \"Ms. King:\" is excluded. The next part mentions \"the Council\" (UN Security Council) deciding to hold a debate on \"Women and peace and security.\" The Council's action here is positive, leading to a historic discussion, so maybe Hero. But according to rule 4, entities that are thanked or commended passively might not be tagged. However, the Council's decision is active, so perhaps <HER>the Council</HER>.\n\nNext, \"Your country's strong leadership, Mr. President, in holding the landmark May seminar...\" The country here is Namibia (implied by Windhoek Declaration). \"Your country's strong leadership\" is a possessive NP, so tag as Hero. \"Mr. President\" refers to Namibia's president, but since it's a position, unless it's personified, maybe not. Wait, the example in guidelines allows \"my delegation\" as a Hero. So \"Your country's strong leadership\" would be <HER>Your country's strong leadership</HER>. Then \"Namibia Plan of Action\" is an organization, and since it's part of the achievement, Hero. Similarly, \"United Nations Transition Assistance Group\" is an organization contributing to peace, Hero.\n\nLater, \"the General Assembly's twenty-third special session\" is an organization, but the session itself might be an abstract concept. However, since it's linked to actions (chairing), maybe Hero. Need to check if it's personified. The example says UN Resolutions are tagged only if personified. Here, the session is being credited with steps towards peace, so perhaps Hero.\n\nIn the next paragraph, \"the Council's decision to take a thematic approach\" \u2013 again, the Council as Hero. \"Bangladesh\" chaired a recognition event, so Hero. \"Canada\" led a discussion on Afghanistan women, so Hero. \"resolution 1314 (2000)\" \u2013 since it's a Council resolution and the context is about taking action, if it's personified. The example says if the resolution \"calls for action,\" it's Hero. Here, it's mentioned as part of developments leading to the meeting, so maybe not personified. So not tagged.\n\nMoving on, \"the Secretary-General\" is a person, and he's returned from a peace area, so Hero. \"Brahimi Panel's report\" \u2013 the Panel is an organization, and the report is part of peace operations, so Hero.\n\nIn discussing conflict effects, \"women and girls\" are mentioned as victims in past discussions. Here, \"women and girls\" are portrayed as victims, so <VIC>women and girls</VIC>. Later, \"local women\" are empowered by UN missions, so Hero. \"Women's groups\" are active in peace, Hero.\n\nThe study mentions \"Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO)\", \"Division for the Advancement of Women\", etc., which are organizations contributing to peace, so Heroes. Member States funding the study are Heroes.\n\nWhen discussing women's participation leading to mobilizing local women, \"women in a mission\" are Heroes. \"Women peacekeepers\" are Heroes. \"Women political monitors\" as Heroes. \"mixed teams of women and men\" \u2013 Hero. \"Department of Peacekeeping Operations\" again as Hero.\n\nIn the part about local women's activities, \"Somali women\" helped negotiations, Hero. \"Grass-roots women's organizations\" \u2013 Hero. \"Organization of African Unity (OAU) African Women's Committee on peace and development\" \u2013 Hero.\n\nMentioned UN agencies like UNHCR, UNICEF, etc., are Heroes as they support peace. \"UNDP\", \"UNIFEM\" \u2013 Heroes.\n\nThe \"Brahimi report\" is referenced, and since it's a report influencing policy, but unless personified, maybe not. However, the report's recommendations are being implemented, so if the report is personified as calling for action, then Hero. The example says resolutions are tagged if personified. Here, the Brahimi report's implementation is discussed, so maybe not personified. So not tagged.\n\nTowards the end, \"Beijing Platform for Action\", \"Windhoek Declaration\", \"Namibia Plan of Action\" are documents, but they're part of the blueprint for future actions. Since they're not personified, maybe not tagged. However, if they're seen as active guides, maybe Hero. The example says UN resolutions are only tagged if personified. These are similar, so probably not tagged.\n\nThe \"Millennium Declaration\" is mentioned as emphasizing equality, but it's an abstract document, so not tagged.\n\nIn the closing, \"the United Nations Charter\" is an abstract entity, not tagged.\n\nNow, checking for Victims: Earlier, \"women and girls\" as victims. Later, \"women\" in some contexts might be victims, but the speech emphasizes their active roles. However, in the part where \"local women are more likely to confide in women peacekeepers on such matters as rape and other sexual violence,\" the victims here are the local women experiencing sexual violence, but the text says \"local women\" confide, which is about their role as active participants, not directly as victims. The mention of rape and sexual violence refers to their experiences, but the entity \"local women\" here is part of the sentence about confiding, so maybe not tagged as Victim unless explicitly stated as victims. Wait, the sentence is \"local women are more likely to confide in women peacekeepers on such matters as rape and other sexual violence.\" The \"local women\" are the ones experiencing these issues, so they are Victims. So <VIC>local women</VIC> here.\n\nAnother instance: \"women's rights to land and household property which may have been in the name of a spouse killed or 'disappeared' in a conflict.\" Here, \"women\" are victims of losing property rights, so <VIC>women</VIC>.\n\nAlso, in the beginning, \"women's role as victims\" is mentioned, so \"victims\" is a generic term. According to guideline 5, if a specific entity is mentioned later, like \"women\", then \"victims\" is tagged as Victim. But in the sentence \"concentrated on their role as victims\", \"their\" refers to \"women and girls\". So \"their role as victims\" \u2013 here, \"victims\" is a predicate nominative, so per guideline 1f, do not annotate. So only \"women and girls\" as Victim earlier.\n\nVillains: Are there any entities causing harm? The speech talks about conflicts, non-State actors, child soldiers, etc. For example, \"non-State actors are protagonists in armed conflict; even children become involved.\" Here, \"non-State actors\" and \"children\" (as child soldiers) might be Villains. But the speaker is describing the changing nature of war, not necessarily portraying them as villains. The Secretary-General notes this as a fact. So unless the speaker explicitly blames them, maybe not. Similarly, \"the proliferation of small arms\" is a cause, but it's an abstract concept, not an entity. So maybe no Villains tagged here.\n\nAnother part: \"rape and other sexual violence\" \u2013 the perpetrators are not mentioned, so no Villain tags. The speech focuses more on the victims and heroes.\n\nCombined roles: Are there entities that are both Hero and Victim? For example, women who are victims but also heroes. In the sentence \"women are not only victims\", but in this speech, it's about moving beyond seeing them as victims. However, specific mentions like \"local women\" who are victims of violence but also heroes in peacebuilding might require combined tags. For example, when \"local women\" are both confiding about rape (Victim) and being mobilized (Hero), but in different contexts. Since the annotation is per mention, each instance is separate. So in the sentence where they confide about rape, they're Victims, but in other contexts, Heroes. So no combined tags unless a single mention has both roles.\n\nWait, the example given in the guidelines for combined roles is when an entity is portrayed with multiple roles in the same context. For instance, a woman's vital role (Hero) and her work being undervalued (Victim) in the same sentence. In this speech, are there such instances?\n\nLooking at \"women's right to participate in all aspects of the peace process\" \u2013 here, women are Heroes fighting for rights. No combined role. Another part: \"women take on a number of peace-building activities\" while fleeing as refugees \u2013 here, they're Victims (fleeing) and Heroes (peace-building). But in the text: \"even when having to flee to safety with their families or protecting them in refugee or displaced-persons camps, women take on a number of peace-building activities.\" Here, \"women\" are both Victims (fleeing) and Heroes (peace-building). So this might be a case for <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>. However, according to the guidelines, combined tags are used when the entity is portrayed in multiple roles in the same context. Here, the sentence describes them as both fleeing (Victim) and taking on activities (Hero). So yes, combined Hero and Victim.\n\nSimilarly, \"women are active negotiators and able to see more clearly issues that affect women differently than men.\" Here, \"women\" as negotiators (Hero) and affected differently (possibly Victim). But the second part is about their perspective, not necessarily their victimhood. Maybe not a combined tag here.\n\nAnother example: \"women's rights to land and household property which may have been in the name of a spouse killed or 'disappeared' in a conflict.\" Here, \"women\" are Victims (denied rights) but also Heroes (seeking rights through legal support). However, the sentence is about their rights being established, so the legal support groups are Heroes, and the women are Victims. So \"women\" here would be Victims.\n\nThis is getting complex. I need to ensure each mention is tagged based on its immediate context.\n\nNow, applying the tags:\n\n- \"the Council\" (UN Security Council) when it takes actions like holding debates or making decisions: <HER>the Council</HER>\n- \"Your country's strong leadership\" (Namibia): <HER>Your country's strong leadership</HER>\n- \"the United Nations Transition Assistance Group\": <HER>the United Nations Transition Assistance Group</HER>\n- \"Windhoek Declaration and Namibia Plan of Action\": <HER>Windhoek Declaration and Namibia Plan of Action</HER>\n- \"the General Assembly's twenty-third special session\": <HER>the General Assembly's twenty-third special session</HER>\n- \"the representative of Canada\": <HER>the representative of Canada</HER>\n- \"the Secretary-General\": <HER>the Secretary-General</HER>\n- \"Brahimi Panel's report\": Not tagged unless personified. The report is discussed as part of implementation, so not personified. Not tagged.\n- \"women and girls\": When mentioned as victims, <VIC>women and girls</VIC>\n- \"local women\": When they are empowered or active, <HER>local women</HER>; when confiding about sexual violence, <VIC>local women</VIC>\n- \"Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO)\": <HER>Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO)</HER>\n- \"Division for the Advancement of Women\": <HER>Division for the Advancement of Women</HER>\n- \"Member States\": When funding the study, <HER>Member States</HER>\n- \"women in a mission\": <HER>women in a mission</HER>\n- \"women peacekeepers\": <HER>women peacekeepers</HER>\n- \"mixed teams of women and men\": <HER>mixed teams of women and men</HER>\n- \"women special representatives or heads of mission\": <HER>women special representatives or heads of mission</HER>\n- \"Somali women\": <HER>Somali women</HER>\n- \"Grass-roots women's organizations\": <HER>Grass-roots women's organizations</HER>\n- \"Organization of African Unity (OAU) African Women's Committee on peace and development\": <HER>Organization of African Unity (OAU) African Women's Committee on peace and development</HER>\n- \"United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\": <HER>United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)</HER>\n- \"United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM)\": <HER>United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM)</HER>\n- \"Department of Political Affairs\": <HER>Department of Political Affairs</HER>\n- \"Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\": <HER>Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</HER>\n- \"Department for Disarmament Affairs\": <HER>Department for Disarmament Affairs</HER>\n- \"Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\": <HER>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</HER>\n- \"Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights\": <HER>Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</HER>\n- \"United Nations Children's Fund\": <HER>United Nations Children's Fund</HER>\n- \"World Food Programme\": <HER>World Food Programme</HER>\n- \"World Health Organization\": <HER>World Health Organization</HER>\n- \"United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat)\": <HER>United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat)</HER>\n- \"United Nations Research Institute for Social Development\": <HER>United Nations Research Institute for Social Development</HER>\n- \"Administrative Committee on Coordination's Inter-Agency Committee on Women and Gender Equality\": <HER>Administrative Committee on Coordination's Inter-Agency Committee on Women and Gender Equality</HER>\n- \"Task Force on Women and Peace and Security\": <HER>Task Force on Women and Peace and Security</HER>\n- \"Brahimi report\": Not tagged as it's a report, not personified.\n- \"special representatives\": <HER>special representatives</HER>\n- \"women as special representatives\": <HER>women as special representatives</HER>\n- \"United Nations Charter\": Not tagged as abstract.\n\nCombined roles example: \"even when having to flee to safety with their families or protecting them in refugee or displaced-persons camps, women take on a number of peace-building activities.\" Here, \"women\" are both fleeing (Victim) and peace-building (Hero), so <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>.\n\nAnother example: \"women's rights to land and household property which may have been in the name of a spouse killed or 'disappeared' in a conflict.\" Here, \"women\" are Victims, so <VIC>women</VIC>.\n\nNow, applying these tags throughout the speech, ensuring correct noun phrases and nesting where necessary. Also, checking for possessive modifiers and full NPs.\n\nFor example: \"Your country's strong leadership, Mr. President, in holding the landmark May seminar...\" becomes <HER>Your country's strong leadership</HER>, Mr. President,...\n\nAnother example: \"the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), my office and the Division for the Advancement of Women of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs\" \u2013 each of these organizations are Heroes, so tagged individually.\n\nAlso, \"the Windhoek Declaration and the Namibia Plan of Action\" as a combined NP sharing the same role, tagged as one <HER> entity.\n\nNeed to be careful with lists. For example, \"the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the World Food Programme and the World Health Organization.\" Each of these is an organization contributing positively, so each is tagged as <HER>.\n\nAnother point: \"women\u2019s right to participate in all aspects of the peace process\" \u2013 \"women\" here are part of a possessive NP, but \"women's right\" is an abstract concept. Wait, the guidelines say to tag people, organizations, etc. \"women\" here are part of the noun phrase \"women's right\", which is an abstract concept. But according to rule 3, we should tag \"Groups\" as entities. \"Women\" as a group are being discussed in terms of their rights, so maybe <HER>women\u2019s</HER> right... But the example in guidelines says \"my delegation\" is tagged, which is possessive. So \"women's right\" \u2013 the NP is \"women's\", so tag <HER>women\u2019s</HER> right... But \"right\" is an abstract concept. Wait, the entity to tag is \"women\" as a group. So \"women's\" is a possessive modifier within the NP, so according to rule 1c, include possessive modifiers. So \"<HER>women\u2019s</HER> right to participate...\" But \"women's\" is part of the noun phrase \"women's right\", which is an abstract concept. However, \"women\" as a group is an entity. The guidelines say to tag groups. So even though it's possessive, \"women's\" is part of the NP and refers to the group, so tagged as Hero.\n\nBut in the example given in guidelines: \u201cmy delegation\u201d is tagged as Hero. So similarly, \"women\u2019s\" in \"women's right\" would be tagged as Hero. So \"<HER>women\u2019s</HER> right to participate...\".\n\nBut need to check if \"women\" here are portrayed as Heroes. Since they're fighting for their right to participate, which aligns with Hero criteria (recognizing injustice and fighting it). So yes, <HER>women\u2019s</HER> right...\n\nAnother example: \"the sceptics\" \u2013 are they Villains? The sceptics challenge the value of women's participation. According to role definitions, Villains cause harm or prevent equal rights. The sceptics here are portrayed as obstacles, so maybe <VIL>the sceptics</VIL>. But need to confirm. The speaker says \"challenged by the sceptics to present empirical rather than anecdotal findings.\" The sceptics are demanding evidence, which might not be villainous but skeptical. However, in the context of the speech, the sceptics are hindering the recognition of women's roles, thus acting against gender equality. So perhaps Villain. So \"<VIL>the sceptics</VIL>\".\n\nSimilarly, in \"lessons from Namibia and South Africa had little effect on Cambodia or Bosnia Herzegovina\", the entities \"Cambodia\" and \"Bosnia Herzegovina\" are mentioned as places where lessons weren't applied. Are they Villains? No, they are locations where missions occurred, not entities causing harm. So not tagged.\n\nNow, putting it all together, ensuring that each applicable entity is tagged correctly, nested where necessary, and following the guidelines strictly.\n</think>\n\n<HER>Ms. King</HER>: I am particularly honoured today, as  Special Adviser on Gender Issues, to have the  opportunity to speak in this debate, which is so  historic, when for the first time <HER>the Council</HER> has decided  to devote an entire open discussion to the topic  \"Women and peace and security\".    It is only fairly recently that the experience of  <VIC>women and girls</VIC> in armed conflict has been discussed,  and then discussion has usually concentrated on their  role as victims. Today's debate will show that we have  come a long way in a relatively short time. <HER>Your  country's strong leadership</HER>, Mr. President, in holding  the landmark May seminar which marked this year's  tenth anniversary of <HER>the United Nations Transition  Assistance Group</HER> resulted in <HER>the historic Windhoek  Declaration and Namibia Plan of Action</HER> on  \"Mainstreaming a Gender Perspective in  Multidimensional Peace Support Operations\". This  achievement has won universal admiration among all  those fighting for <HER>women\u2019s</HER> right to participate in all  aspects of the peace process. It and your distinguished  chairing of <HER>the General Assembly's twenty-third  special session</HER>, \"Women 2000: gender equality,  development and peace for the twenty-first century\",  which immediately followed in June, constitute  important steps along the way to considering the  United Nations peace operations from the point of view  of both women and men.    Other important developments have led to today's  meeting. They include <HER>the Council's</HER> decision to take a  thematic approach to its work; the recognition that <HER>the  Council</HER> gave - under the chair of <HER>Bangladesh</HER> - on  International Women's Day, 8 March, to women as  actors in the peace process; the discussion on the  situation of women in Afghanistan, which took place in  April, led by <HER>the representative of Canada</HER>; and <HER>the  Council's</HER> resolution 1314 (2000) of 11 August.    The timeliness of this discussion is also  significant. <HER>The Secretary-General</HER> has just returned  from an area where he undoubtedly had an opportunity  to see at first hand the role <HER>women and men</HER> should  play in their societies to bring about peace and to  rebuild those societies. The discussion also coincides  with the consideration of <HER>the Brahimi Panel's</HER> report  (8/2000/809) on peace operations and its  implementation.    There are three broad areas to be considered in  the context of today's discussion: how armed conflict  affects women; how women actually respond to  conflict, the peace process and post-conflict  reconstruction; and how we plan strategically for a  future in which women are equal partners with men in  enhancing our effectiveness in peace operations.    Today I would like to concentrate on the two  latter points, drawing on my experience as Chief of  Mission in <HER>the United Nations Observer Mission in  South Africa (UNOMSA)</HER>.    What do women actually do in conflict situations,  and how do they respond? <HER>The Secretary-General</HER> has  repeatedly emphasized the changing nature of war. He  has noted that modern warfare is increasingly  conducted within, rather than between, States, and that  <HER>the Security Council</HER> is now called on to deal with such  conflicts. He has stressed that more and more non-State  actors are protagonists in armed conflict; even children  become involved. The proliferation of small arms and  the ease with which they can be acquired, clearly  shown in <HER>the Department for Disarmament Affairs and  Department of Public Information</HER> video documentary  \"Armed to the Teeth\", has also added a new dimension.    The socio-economic fabric of a country has now  to be the major focus of attention. Societal dynamics  thus become a key guide to finding entry points into  resolving disputes. <HER>Groups within each society</HER>, and  especially <HER>women's groups, non-governmental,  religious and other groups</HER>, have a major role to play.  Whether these groups were formed before the conflict  or during it is not important. What is important is that  they must be part of all stages of the peace  negotiations, in planning for the future, in rebuilding  and in crafting preventive strategies to avoid conflict.    Often, those of us who have seen the value of  women's participation in peace operations at first hand  are challenged by <VIL>the sceptics</VIL> to present empirical  rather than anecdotal findings. In this connection, I am  pleased to report on the results of a joint three-year  effort of <HER>the Department of Peacekeeping Operations  (DPKO)</HER>, my office and <HER>the Division for the  Advancement of Women</HER> of <HER>the Department of  Economic and Social Affairs</HER>, a study that was  supported by the generous funding of <HER>several Member  States</HER>. This study, \"Mainstreaming a Gender  Perspective in Multidimensional Peace Operations\" has  just been finalized.  The study looks at five peace operations, in  Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia, El Salvador,  Namibia and South Africa. It answers <VIL>the sceptics</VIL> by  giving objective and empirical findings on what  women staff do in missions; whether and how they  influence the outcomes; and how their participating  equally with men can improve the efficiency of United  Nations peacekeeping. <HER>The Windhoek Declaration and  the Namibia Plan of Action</HER> were informed by these  findings.    Exactly what does this study tell us? It shows  unequivocally that when there is a critical mass of  <HER>women in a mission</HER> - at least 30 per cent - <VIC>local  women</VIC> are more easily mobilized to join peace  committees. This occurred in South Africa, El Salvador  and Namibia, where <HER>women</HER> actively promoted voter  education and the rights of individual women to vote.  In other words, <HER>women's participation in United  Nations missions</HER> empowers <HER>local women</HER> and may  inspire them to organize for the achievement of a  democratic society.    <HER>Women's participation</HER> has the capacity to expand  the debate a little further so that it may encompass  more diverse subjects, including those that may be  more relevant to <VIC>women and children</VIC>. <HER>Women</HER> are  frequently less hierarchical in dealing with <HER>local  communities</HER> and listen more, thereby having better  insights into the root causes of conflict. <VIC>Local women</VIC>  are more likely to confide in <HER>women peacekeepers</HER> on  such matters as rape and other sexual violence. The  presence of a critical mass of <HER>women</HER> appears to foster  confidence and trust among <HER>the local population</HER>, and  this is critical to successful operations, such as in El  Salvador. <HER>Women</HER> are active negotiators and able to see  more clearly issues that affect <VIC>women</VIC> differently than  men.    <HER>Women's participation</HER> in all aspects of a mission  can help to break down stereotypes held by <VIC>women</VIC> in  many local communities, especially where <HER>women  peacekeepers</HER> serve in a broad spectrum of the activities  of a mission. This has had a spin-off effect on the  participation of <HER>local women</HER> in decision-making  positions. <HER>Women political monitors</HER> are just as willing  and capable of serving in dangerous or isolated areas as  men, and do so just as effectively.    The study also shows that <HER>mixed teams of women  and men</HER>, a significant proportion of <HER>women team  leaders</HER>, <HER>women special representatives or heads of  mission</HER>, or a conscious effort by a special  representative to seek the best staff, whether women or  men, has a positive influence on the outcome. <HER>Women</HER>  also respond by participating in <HER>the troop-contributing  countries' military and civilian police contingents</HER>. <HER>The  Department of Peacekeeping Operations</HER> has made  strenuous efforts to encourage <HER>Member States</HER> to send  <HER>women</HER> on missions, on the basis of equity, as their  presence can assist in defusing potentially tense  situations. Much more should be done in order to  encourage <HER>women</HER> to enter this service.    What do this and other studies tell us about what  <HER_VIC>local women</HER_VIC> do? There is abundant evidence to show  that even when having to flee to safety with their  families or protecting them in refugee or displaced-  persons camps, <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> take on a number of peace-  building activities.    <HER>Women</HER> are active at both formal and informal  levels. With few exceptions, <VIC>women</VIC> are not present in  formal peace negotiations. However, <HER>women</HER> have been  part of these negotiations, as we saw in the field in  Burundi, and in Guatemala and South Africa. <HER>Somali  women</HER> helped to bring the clan leaders back into the  negotiations at one stage and were permitted to join the  negotiations as observers.    Most of the activities, however, take place at the  informal level. <HER>Grass-roots women's organizations</HER> in  several countries have sponsored peace education;  encouraged <VIC>child soldiers</VIC> to lay down arms; organized  <HER>groups advocating peace across party and ethnic lines</HER>;  organized campaigns against small arms, such as <HER>the  Organization of African Unity (OAU) African  Women's Committee on peace and development</HER>;  influenced repatriation processes and established  services for returning exiles, such as in Guatemala;  contributed to ending conflict; negotiated the release of  hostages; and established <HER>legal support groups</HER> to get  recognition for <VIC>women\u2019s</VIC> rights to land and household  property which may have been in the name of a spouse  killed or \"disappeared\" in a conflict.    <HER>Women at the local level</HER> are a rich resource  waiting to be systematically tapped by <HER>the international  community</HER>. Many aspects of these informal activities  have been encouraged, supported financially and  documented by <HER>the United Nations</HER> and its agencies. In  this connection, in addition to the work of <HER>the  Department of Peacekeeping Operations</HER>, <HER>the  Department of Political Affairs</HER>, <HER>the Office for the  Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</HER> and <HER>the  Department for Disarmament Affairs</HER> should be  mentioned. Special mention should also be made of <HER>the  work of the Office of the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees</HER>, <HER>the Office of the High  Commissioner for Human Rights</HER>, <HER>the United Nations  Children's Fund</HER>, <HER>the World Food Programme</HER> and <HER>the  World Health Organization</HER>. <HER>The United Nations  Development Programme (UNDP)</HER>, <HER>the United Nations  Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM)</HER> and <HER>the  United Nations Centre for Human Settlements  (Habitat)</HER> should also be credited with pioneering work  at the national and grass-roots levels. Good practices  have been identified, studied and published, including  the study by <HER>the United Nations Research Institute for  Social Development</HER>, \"Women and Post-Conflict  Reconstruction\". The exchange of information on these  practices has enabled <HER>the United Nations system</HER> to  encourage <HER>States</HER> engaged in rehabilitation to work in  partnership with and sustain <HER>women's groups and civil  society</HER> engaged in these essential but often  unrecognized activities. Capacity-building for  leadership and governance led by <HER>UNDP</HER> and <HER>UNIFEM</HER>  has greatly facilitated <HER>women's</HER> ability to play  constructive roles.    These entities are all members of <HER>the  Administrative Committee on Coordination's Inter-  Agency Committee on Women and Gender Equality</HER>,  which I chair. We have lately formed <HER>a Task Force on  Women and Peace and Security</HER> to strengthen  collaboration on this critical issue.    This brings me to our vision for the future. The  basic blueprint appears in <HER>the Beijing Platform for  Action</HER>, <HER>the Beijing + 5 outcome document</HER>, <HER>the  Windhoek Declaration</HER> and <HER>the Namibia Plan of Action</HER>.  It also appears in the many powerful statements from  <HER>women's groups</HER> that we heard yesterday in <HER>the  Council's</HER> Arria-formula meeting.    The planning of any mission must include gender  equality aspects. The mandate of the mission and the  guidelines for <HER>special representatives</HER> must clearly  indicate that gender considerations must be integrated  into the mission's goals and <HER>the head of mission</HER> be  accountable. Each mission should have a plan for  incorporating gender issues into all aspects of the  mission's work. There should be a gender unit,  adequately staffed and resourced to provide the  necessary backstopping on the mission site, and one in  <HER>DPKO</HER> for overall oversight. I am pleased to state that  <HER>DPKO</HER> has established two such units- one in East  Timor and one in Kosovo - and gender focal points in  Sierra Leone and Western Sahara. All sectors of the  transition or rebuilding process should take gender  issues into account. Greater attention must be paid to  ensuring the appointment of <HER>women as special  representatives</HER>, in accordance with <HER>the Brahimi report</HER>  and the call by <HER>women heads of State and Government</HER> of 5 September. <HER>The Council</HER> may wish to ensure that  all the reports that it receives on missions contain  information and data on the extent to which a gender  perspective has been introduced and on the number and  level of <HER>women</HER> working in the various missions.  Working with <HER>the agencies</HER> on the ground, <HER>the political  and development wings of the mission</HER> should organize  the mobilization of <HER>community groups</HER>, especially  <HER>women's groups</HER>, and expand the pool of skills needed  to sustain the peace process. A roster of such groups  could be kept by <HER>DPKO</HER>, in collaboration with <HER>regional  bodies and agencies</HER>. The code of conduct for  peacekeepers should be regularly updated and where  there are infringements, there should be a continuation  of apprehension and discipline. Should it be decided to  appoint a new assistant secretary-general in <HER>the  Department of Peacekeeping Operations</HER>, as proposed  in <HER>the Panel's</HER> report, strong consideration should be  given to appointing <HER>a woman</HER> to one of the three  assistant secretary-general posts in <HER>the Department</HER>.    In closing, may I recall the main finding of the  joint study made by <HER>the Department of Peacekeeping  Operations</HER> and <HER>the Division for the Advancement of  Women</HER>. It was that the most important lesson learned  is that lessons are not always learned. Lessons from  Namibia and South Africa had little effect on  Cambodia or Bosnia Herzegovina, for example. Gender  equality issues are absolutely essential to the success of  any peace operation. We cannot exclude half the  world's resources from participating in peace.  The fundamental human right to have and to  enjoy equality is a given. It was emphasized by <HER>the  Beijing Conference</HER> and reaffirmed again in <HER>the  Beijing +5 outcome document</HER> and even more so at <HER>the  Millennium Declaration</HER>. There can be no peace  without gender equality and no development without  both peace and equality. Without the equal and fair  participation of <HER>women</HER> in decision-making positions in  <HER>the United Nations</HER> and also in <HER>Member States</HER>, as well  as in this central organ of <HER>the United Nations</HER>, we will  never achieve the vision outlined in <HER>the United Nations  Charter</HER>. May this discussion and the decisions that  follow be those in which we demonstrate that, at least  in the area of women and peace and security, this is one  lesson that we have learned and intend to put into  action.",
    "UNSC_2005_SPV.5294_spch027.txt": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this annotation task step by step. First, I need to read through the entire speech carefully to understand the context and identify the entities mentioned. The goal is to label each relevant entity as Hero, Villain, Victim, or a combination based on the guidelines provided.\n\nStarting with the opening, the speaker thanks several individuals and organizations. According to the guidelines, entities that are thanked or commended but are passive shouldn't be tagged. However, the Secretary-General, Under-Secretary-General, and others like Ms. Mayanja and Ms. Heyzer are mentioned as providing briefings. Since they are part of the United Nations system and contributing to the implementation of resolution 1325, they might be Heroes. The example given in the guidelines includes thanking a group of people as a Hero entity if they are part of the same NP. So, \"the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan\" and \"Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Guehenno, Ms. Rachel Mayanja, Ms. Noeleen Heyzer and other participants\" should be tagged as HER.\n\nNext, the speech mentions resolution 1325 (2000) multiple times. The guidelines state that UN Resolutions should only be tagged if personified. In the sentence \"resolution 1325 (2000) calls for action,\" it's personified, but here, the Secretary-General's report makes recommendations for its implementation. However, in \"implementation of resolution 1325 (2000),\" it's not personified. Wait, the text says \"the international community's attention on the question of women and armed conflict and which provided guidance...\" Here, resolution 1325 is the subject providing guidance, so that's personification. So \"resolution 1325 (2000)\" should be HER here. Similarly, when they mention the fifth anniversary of its adoption, it's not personified, so no tag. But when it's the subject of providing guidance, it is. Need to check each mention.\n\nThen, entities like the Secretariat, peacekeeping operations, Special Adviser, UNDFW, and Member States are mentioned as contributing to the implementation. These are organizations and groups actively working, so they should be HER. The international community is mentioned as attaching greater importance to women's role, so \"international community\" is HER. The Department of Peacekeeping Operations is taking action, so HER. Gender advisers appointed: HER.\n\nThe High-level Plenary Meeting's leaders stressing women's role: \"world leaders\" as HER. \n\nIn the section about eliminating root causes of conflict, \"we must cure the disease...\" \u2013 \"we\" refers to the collective effort, but according to the guidelines, the speaker's own delegation is tagged. However, \"we\" here is the Security Council or Member States, which are organizations, so maybe HER. But the example given in guidelines includes \"my delegation\" as HER. So \"we\" in this context might be considered as HER if it's referring to the collective effort of the entities involved. However, the guidelines say not to tag abstract groups unless they are specific. Hmm. The guidelines say to tag groups when they are mentioned with their achievements. Here, \"we must strive...\" is a call to action, so \"we\" as the actors would be HER. But \"we\" is the speaker's delegation? Wait, the speaker is from China, so \"we\" might refer to China's delegation, but in the context of the speech, it's more likely referring to the collective Member States or the Security Council. The guidelines say to tag groups when they are mentioned in the context of their actions. Since this is a call to action, \"we\" here is part of the collective effort, so HER. But the example in guidelines includes \"my delegation\" as HER. So \"we\" in this context could be HER.\n\nNext, \"crimes of sexual assault must be punished more harshly; violence against women...\" The perpetrators here are villains. So \"perpetrators\" would be VIL. \"United Nations peacekeeping operations\" continuing zero-tolerance policy: HER.\n\nThirdly, women should be encouraged to participate. Here, women are mentioned as both victims and participants. The text explicitly states \"women are both the primary victims of armed conflicts... and indispensable participants.\" So \"women\" here should be VIC and HER. But according to the guidelines, if an entity is portrayed with multiple roles, use combined tags. So <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>. However, in the example given, when women are described as victims and agents of peace, they are tagged as HER_VIC. Here, \"primary victims\" and \"indispensable participants\" so that's VIC and HER. So combined HER_VIC.\n\nLater, \"mothers, wives and daughters\" are mentioned as shedding tears due to war, so they are victims. \"Mothers, wives and daughters\" as VIC. \"Sisters worldwide\" also VIC.\n\nThe Chinese saying \"women hold up half of the sky\" \u2013 this is a metaphorical reference, but the guideline says not to tag abstract concepts. However, \"women\" here are being praised for their role, so maybe HER. But in the previous mention, women are HER_VIC. Need to check context. The sentence says \"women have played an important... role in the formation of human civilization...\" So \"women\" here are HER. Then the saying reinforces that, so \"women\" in the saying would be HER. But \"mothers, wives and daughters\" are VIC because they are suffering. So separate tags.\n\nNow, checking the output format: overlapping annotations should nest. For example, if a victim is within a villain entity. But in this speech, I don't see such cases. The main overlaps would be combined roles.\n\nAlso, the guidelines mention not to tag predicate nominatives. For example, \"Women are not only victims\" \u2013 here, \"victims\" is a predicate, so not tagged. But in the speech, \"women are both the primary victims...\" \u2013 here, \"victims\" is part of the description, so according to guideline 2e, do not annotate predicate nominatives. Wait, the example says in \"Women are not only victims,\" victims should not be annotated. So in the speech's sentence \"women are both the primary victims...\", \"victims\" is a predicate nominative, so \"women\" should be tagged as VIC and HER, but the word \"victims\" itself is not tagged. Wait, the example says in \"Women are not only victims,\" the word \"victims\" is not tagged, but \"women\" is tagged as VIC. Wait, the example given is: \u201c<VIC>Women</VIC> are not only victims.\u201d So in that case, \"Women\" is tagged as VIC, but \"victims\" is not. So applying that here, in \"women are both the primary victims...\", \"women\" would be tagged as HER_VIC because they are both victims and participants (HER). So the entire NP \"women\" is tagged as HER_VIC.\n\nAnother point: the guidelines say to include possessive modifiers, like \"my delegation\" as HER. So \"our sisters worldwide\" \u2013 \"sisters\" is part of a possessive, but \"sisters worldwide\" is the entity. Since they are mentioned as leading happy lives, which is a desired outcome, they are victims needing protection. So \"sisters worldwide\" as VIC.\n\nUN Resolutions: when resolution 1325 is mentioned as providing guidance, it's personified, so HER. Other mentions like \"implementation of resolution 1325\" are not personified, so no tag.\n\nNow, going through the speech line by line:\n\n\"Mr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese):\" \u2013 according to guideline 4, speakers at the beginning separated by a colon are not tagged. So no tags here.\n\n\"I wish at the outset to thank you, Mr. President, for initiating and organizing today's meeting.\" \u2013 \"Mr. President\" is a role, not an entity to tag unless it's a specific person. Since it's a title, maybe not tagged. The guidelines say not to tag positions unless they refer to specific entities. Since \"Mr. President\" is a role, but in the UN context, it refers to the current president of the Security Council, which is a person. However, the example says not to tag speakers at the beginning. Wait, guideline 4 says: \"Speakers at the beginning of the input, separated from the content of the speech with a colon.\" So the speaker's name and info before the colon are not tagged. But \"Mr. President\" within the speech is part of the content. The guidelines say to tag people. So \"Mr. President\" is a person, so HER? He's being thanked for initiating the meeting, which is a positive action. So HER.\n\n\"I thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his report...\" \u2013 \"Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan\" as HER. The entire NP includes the title and name.\n\n\"Our thanks go also to Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Guehenno, Ms. Rachel Mayanja, Ms. Noeleen Heyzer and other participants for their presentations...\" \u2013 this is a list of people and roles. According to guideline 1d, if multiple characters are listed together as part of the same NP and share a common role, tag the entire sequence. So the entire list is HER.\n\n\"In his report, the Secretary-General makes many concrete recommendations...\" \u2013 \"the Secretary-General\" is HER again.\n\n\"We welcome his recommendations...\" \u2013 \"we\" refers to the delegation, which is HER.\n\n\"This year marks both the fifth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)...\" \u2013 resolution mentioned but not personified, so no tag.\n\n\"Five years ago the Security Council adopted resolution 1325 (2000), which focused the international community's attention...\" \u2013 here, resolution 1325 is the subject of \"focused... attention and provided guidance\", so personified. So \"<HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>\".\n\n\"In the five years since then - thanks to the efforts of the Secretariat, the relevant peacekeeping operations, the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, the United Nations Development Fund for Women and Member States - much has been achieved...\" \u2013 the list of entities here are all contributing to implementation, so HER. The entire NP is \"the Secretariat... Member States\", so tag as HER.\n\n\"The international community now attaches greater importance...\" \u2013 \"international community\" as HER.\n\n\"the Department of Peacekeeping Operations has mandated that enhanced protection...\" \u2013 Department of Peacekeeping Operations as HER.\n\n\"gender advisers have been appointed.\" \u2013 \"gender advisers\" as HER.\n\n\"world leaders once again stressed the important role...\" \u2013 \"world leaders\" as HER.\n\n\"attaining the goals defined in resolution 1325 (2000).\" \u2013 resolution not personified here.\n\n\"we must strive to eliminate the root causes...\" \u2013 \"we\" as HER (collective effort).\n\n\"crimes of sexual assault must be punished more harshly; violence against women must be more seriously investigated and its perpetrators must be brought to justice.\" \u2013 \"perpetrators\" as VIL.\n\n\"United Nations peacekeeping operations must continue...\" \u2013 HER.\n\n\"women should be encouraged to participate...\" \u2013 women as HER_VIC because later stated as victims and participants.\n\n\"women are both the primary victims of armed conflicts of all kinds and indispensable participants...\" \u2013 \"women\" as HER_VIC.\n\n\"their ardent yearning for peace enables them to play a more important role...\" \u2013 \"their\" refers to women, already tagged.\n\n\"efforts should be made to enhance awareness...\" \u2013 no entity to tag.\n\n\"work carried out on this issue by the relevant bodies should be effectively coordinated.\" \u2013 \"relevant bodies\" as HER.\n\n\"Organs such as the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council...\" \u2013 these are organizations contributing, so HER.\n\n\"The Security Council should coordinate...\" \u2013 HER.\n\n\"Women have played an important... role...\" \u2013 women as HER.\n\n\"A popular Chinese saying has it that women hold up half of the sky.\" \u2013 women as HER.\n\n\"We hope that... mothers, wives and daughters will no longer shed their tears...\" \u2013 \"mothers, wives and daughters\" as VIC.\n\n\"all our sisters worldwide will lead happy...\" \u2013 \"sisters worldwide\" as VIC.\n\nNow, applying the tags:\n\nOriginal text: \"Mr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese): I wish at the outset to thank you, Mr. President, for initiating and organizing today's meeting. I thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his report on the United Nations system-wide action plan (S/2005/636).

We welcome his recommendations and express the hope that they can be effectively implemented.\"\n\n- \"the Secretary-General\" as HER.\n- \"resolution 1325 (2000)\" not personified here, so no tag.\n\nNext: \"This year marks both the fifth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and the tenth anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing.

The international community now attaches greater importance to the role of women in the settlement of armed conflicts, and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations has mandated that enhanced protection of women be a very important component of the daily work of peacekeeping operations. Both at Headquarters and in many peacekeeping operations, gender advisers have been appointed.\"\n\n- \"resolution 1325 (2000)\" as HER because it's personified (provided guidance).\n- \"the Secretariat, the relevant peacekeeping operations, the Special Adviser...

    "UNSC_2014_SPV.7289_spch006.txt": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this annotation task. First, I need to read through the entire speech carefully to identify all the entities that fit the Hero, Villain, or Victim roles based on the guidelines provided. Let's start by breaking down the speech paragraph by paragraph.\n\nThe speaker is Mr. Beyani, who begins by thanking the Permanent Mission of Argentina and other Security Council members. According to the guidelines, speakers at the beginning separated by a colon shouldn't be tagged. So \"Mr. Beyani:\" is just the speaker and not tagged. The next part mentions the Permanent Mission of Argentina and the Security Council. The Security Council is an organization, and since they're holding the debate, which is a positive action, they might be Heroes. But the guidelines say not to tag entities that are just being thanked or commended unless they are actively doing something. The Security Council is holding the debate, which is part of their role, so maybe Hero. The Permanent Mission of Argentina is part of the Security Council here, so likely Hero.\n\nNext, \"internally displaced women and girls\" are mentioned. The context is about their role in negotiating peace, ensuring rights, and development. They are portrayed positively but also as needing protection. So they could be both Hero and Victim. The guidelines say if they are both, use the combined tag. So <HER_VIC>internally displaced women and girls</HER_VIC>.\n\nMoving on, the speaker mentions his mandate, which involves dialogue with Governments and the international community. Governments here are being advised and advocated to, so they might be Heroes if they are taking action, but since it's about advising them, maybe they're not active here. The international community is also mentioned. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), UNHCR, and OCHA are listed as providing support. These are organizations supporting the mandate, so they should be Heroes. The Member States are also supporting, so Heroes as well. Chile and Argentina co-chaired a meeting, so they're Heroes.\n\nThe number of displaced persons is mentioned, 33.3 million, with women and girls as half. These are Victims because they're displaced due to conflict, violence, etc. So \"women and girls\" again as Victims. The Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement are mentioned, and they're recognized by the General Assembly and Security Council. The Guiding Principles themselves are a document, but since they're personified in the context of informing provisions, maybe they're Heroes. The resolution 1325 (2000) is mentioned as a landmark resolution. Since it's a UN resolution and personified (\"calls for action\"), it should be tagged as Hero.\n\nIn the next paragraphs, the discussion turns to the challenges faced by displaced women. They are victims of rape, torture, etc., so definitely Victims. The perpetrators causing these acts would be Villains, but the text doesn't explicitly name them. Instead, it refers to the situations and the consequences. The text mentions \"armed conflict\" as a cause, but that's an abstract concept. The actual villains might be the parties causing the conflict, but they aren't named here. So maybe no Villain tags here unless specific entities are mentioned.\n\nThe speaker talks about displaced women facing double discrimination, so again Victims. The mention of \"perpetrators\" of sexual violence would be Villains, but again, not named. The text refers to \"States\" lacking frameworks, which could be Villains if they're failing to protect, but according to the guidelines, unless they're actively causing harm, maybe not. The guidelines say Villains cause harm or disrupt peace. If States are failing to act, is that Villain? The guidelines say Villains act to prevent equal rights. Maybe in some cases, but the text says \"States also lack comprehensive systems,\" which is more about inability rather than active prevention. So maybe not Villains here.\n\nIn the section about Ukraine, IDP women are volunteering, showing resilience, so Heroes. Their participation is key, so Hero again. The conclusion thanks Argentina again, which is part of the Security Council, so Hero.\n\nNow, applying the tags:\n\n- \"Permanent Mission of Argentina and the other members of the Security Council\" \u2013 Hero.\n- \"internally displaced women and girls\" \u2013 Hero and Victim combined.\n- \"Governments and the international community\" \u2013 Hero for working on protection.\n- \"United Nations agencies and entities, in particular the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\" \u2013 Hero.\n- \"Member States\" \u2013 Hero.\n- \"Chile and Argentina\" \u2013 Hero.\n- \"33.3 million internally displaced persons\" \u2013 Victim.\n- \"women and girls\" \u2013 Victim.\n- \"resolution 1325 (2000)\" \u2013 Hero.\n- \"Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement\" \u2013 Hero.\n- \"2006 Pact on Security, Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region\" and \"2009 African Union Kampala Convention\" \u2013 Hero as they are instruments aiding protection.\n- \"internally displaced women\" \u2013 Victim in various contexts.\n- \"IDP women and girls\" \u2013 Victim and Hero when participating in solutions.\n- \"perpetrators\" of sexual violence \u2013 Villain, but not explicitly named, so maybe not tagged.\n- \"States\" \u2013 when they lack systems, maybe not tagged as Villain unless they're causing harm.\n- \"IDP women in Ukraine\" \u2013 Hero for their resilience and volunteering.\n\nWait, the guidelines say not to tag abstract concepts. So \"armed conflict\" isn't tagged. Also, when entities are mentioned in the context of their roles but not actively doing something, maybe not. For example, \"Governments\" are being advised, so maybe not Heroes unless they're taking action. The speaker's mandate is about advising them, so perhaps the Governments are not tagged. The international community is supporting, so maybe Hero.\n\nThe key is to tag only entities (people, organizations, countries, groups, UN resolutions if personified). Also, check if the entity is portrayed as Hero, Victim, or Villain based on the role definitions.\n\nAnother point: when the speaker thanks someone, like Argentina, but they are part of the Security Council holding the debate, which is a positive action, so Hero. The entities providing support (UN agencies, Member States) are Heroes.\n\nThe displaced women are both victims (suffering) and heroes (playing roles in peace), so combined HER_VIC.\n\nResolution 1325 is personified as calling for action, so Hero.\n\nGuiding Principles are recognized and inform provisions, so Hero.\n\nIn the example given in the guidelines, UN resolutions are tagged as Hero when personified. So yes.\n\nNow, applying all this to the text step by step.\n\nFirst paragraph:\n\n\"Mr. Beyani: I would like to thank <HER>the Permanent Mission of Argentina and the other members of the Security Council</HER> for holding this open debate on the critical issue of <HER_VIC>displaced women and girls</HER_VIC> in the framework of the women and peace and security agenda...\"\n\nHere, the Permanent Mission and Security Council are Heroes for holding the debate. Displaced women and girls are both Heroes (can play roles in peace) and Victims (displaced), so HER_VIC.\n\nNext: \"internally displaced women can play in negotiating peace...\" Again, HER_VIC.\n\n\"As part of my mandate, I enter into dialogue with Governments and the international community...\" Governments and international community are advised and advocated to, but are they Heroes? The speaker is advising them, which implies they have the capacity to protect. Since they are being worked with to protect IDPs, maybe Hero. So <HER>Governments and the international community</HER>.\n\n\"field missions to Kenya, Azerbaijan, Cote d'Ivoire, Haiti and Ukraine.\" These are countries, but unless they're portrayed in a role, not tagged. The speaker visited them, but no positive/negative portrayal here.\n\n\"Human Rights Council, the General Assembly and... the Security Council\" \u2013 these are organizations part of the UN, acting as early warning systems, so Heroes.\n\n\"My mandate receives specific support from United Nations agencies and entities, in particular the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs...\" These are UN agencies supporting, so Heroes.\n\n\"Member States... working to cope with and to protect IDPs...\" \u2013 Hero.\n\n\"Chile and Argentina\" co-chaired a meeting \u2013 Hero.\n\n\"33.3 million internally displaced persons\" \u2013 Victim.\n\n\"women and girls account for some half\" \u2013 Victim.\n\n\"resolution 1325 (2000)\" \u2013 Hero as it's personified.\n\n\"Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement\" \u2013 Hero.\n\n\"2006 Pact...\" and \"2009 African Union Kampala Convention\" \u2013 Hero instruments.\n\n\"internally displaced women\" \u2013 Victim in various contexts.\n\n\"women and girls are targeted as a means of armed conflict...\" \u2013 Victim.\n\n\"IDPs\" in general as being at risk \u2013 Victim.\n\n\"internally displaced women often face double discrimination...\" \u2013 Victim.\n\n\"displaced women often have to assume new gender roles...\" \u2013 Victim.\n\n\"internally displaced women risk their lives...\" \u2013 Hero and Victim? They are protecting families (Hero) but also victims of violence. The example given in guidelines where a woman is both Hero and Victim would apply here. So <HER_VIC>internally displaced women</HER_VIC>.\n\n\"girls who had been impregnated during displacement...\" \u2013 Victim.\n\n\"displaced women and girls, particularly those belonging to minorities\" \u2013 Victim.\n\n\"IDP women either lacked proper documentation...\" \u2013 Victim.\n\n\"States have neither policy frameworks...\" \u2013 Not tagged as Villain unless they're causing harm. The text says they lack systems, which is a failure but not active villainy.\n\n\"IDP women in Ukraine... volunteering to help other displaced persons\" \u2013 Hero.\n\n\"IDP women and girls\" participating in decision-making \u2013 Hero.\n\nFinally, thanks to Argentina again \u2013 Hero.\n\nNow, applying all these tags step by step, ensuring that the entire noun phrases are tagged, including possessives and modifiers. Also, checking for overlaps and combined roles.\n\nFor example, when \"internally displaced women\" are both victims and heroes, use <HER_VIC>. When they are only victims, use <VIC>.\n\nAlso, ensure that entities like \"the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\" are fully tagged as part of the noun phrase.\n\nBe careful with commas and punctuation, excluding them from the tags when they are at the end of the annotation.\n\nDouble-checking each mention of entities against the guidelines to ensure correct tagging.\n</think>\n\n<HER>Mr. Beyani</HER>: I would like to thank <HER>the Permanent Mission of Argentina and the other members of the Security Council</HER> for holding this open debate on the critical issue of <HER_VIC>displaced women and girls</HER_VIC> in the framework of the women and peace and security agenda. The intersection of peace and security, human rights and development is critical to dealing with the issue of internal displacement. We must not lose sight of the important role that <HER_VIC>internally displaced women</HER_VIC> can play in negotiating peace, ensuring their human rights and bringing about development in post-conflict situations.  \n\nAs part of my mandate, I enter into dialogue with <HER>Governments and the international community</HER> alike to advise on and advocate for the best possible protection of <VIC>internally displaced persons (IDPs)</VIC>, and in all my field missions I pay specific attention to the protection of <VIC>internally displaced women and girls</VIC>. This year alone, I have carried out missions to Kenya, Azerbaijan, Cote d'Ivoire, Haiti and Ukraine. Such field missions are significant in that they provide an early warning system for <HER>the international community</HER> through <HER>the Human Rights Council, the General Assembly</HER> and, in this instance, <HER>the Security Council</HER> itself on the actual causes, conditions and situations of displacement.  \n\nMy mandate receives specific support from <HER>United Nations agencies and entities, in particular the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</HER>, and I am grateful for their support and great collaboration. My work could not be possible without the outstanding support extended by <HER>Member States</HER>, both those working to cope with and to protect <VIC>IDPs</VIC> and those supporting action to improve the lives of <VIC>internally displaced persons</VIC> internationally. I am grateful for the ever-growing cooperation extended by States to my mandate. I would also like to highlight the Arria Formula meeting in May on the protection of <VIC>IDPs</VIC>, co-chaired by <HER>Chile and Argentina</HER>, which I had the privilege to address and during which the issue of internal displacement and threats to international peace and security were tackled.  \n\nWe started 2014 with an unprecedented peak in the number of <VIC>persons forcibly displaced within their own countries</VIC> due to armed conflict, generalized violence or human rights violations - 33.3 million <VIC>internally displaced persons</VIC>, the highest figure ever recorded. In many countries, <VIC>IDPs</VIC> are also displaced by natural disasters, further compounding existing vulnerabilities. <VIC>Women and girls</VIC> account for some half of the world's <VIC>IDP population</VIC>.  \n\nSince the 1990s, greater attention has been paid to the rights and needs of <VIC>women and girls</VIC> in emergency and post-conflict situations and to promoting gender-sensitive approaches in humanitarian, development and early recovery response. A wide range of resolutions - for instance, the landmark <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> - but also policies, gender-mainstreaming efforts and targeted programmes have been adopted in this regard, and they have increasingly encompassed <VIC>internally displaced women and girls</VIC>.  \n\nThe 1998 <HER>Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement</HER>, which detail the specific rights of <VIC>internally displaced women and girls</VIC>, have been recognized by <HER>the General Assembly</HER> and in <HER>Security Council resolutions</HER>. <HER>The Guiding Principles</HER> have informed the inclusion of concrete and progressive provisions on <VIC>internally displaced women</VIC> in subsequent instruments, such as <HER>the 2006 Pact on Security, Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region</HER> and <HER>the 2009 African Union Kampala Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa</HER>. In 2013, I dedicated my thematic report to <HER>the Human Rights Council</HER> to the situation of <VIC>internally displaced women</VIC>, and during this debate I would like to draw to the attention of <HER>the Security Council</HER> to that report.  \n\nDespite such positive developments, responses to internal displacement still do not adequately address the specific concerns and roles of <VIC>women and girls</VIC>. During situations of conflict and violence, <VIC>women and girls</VIC> flee to escape arbitrary killings, rape, torture, inhumane or degrading treatment or starvation. They may have been the <VIC>victims of such violations</VIC> themselves or seen their loved ones attacked and abused. The experience of my mandate is that <VIC>women and girls</VIC> are targeted as a means of armed conflict - to destroy and humiliate communities, to manipulate the demographic composition of communities, for sexual slavery including enforced concubinage, and at times enforced sterilization. As <VIC>IDPs</VIC>, <VIC>women</VIC> experience the various human rights challenges that are characteristic to displacement situations and that often place <VIC>IDPs</VIC> at greater risk than other affected populations. Such challenges include the loss of livelihoods and key documentation, as well as the lack of effective access to a number of important rights and services.  \n\nIn addition, <VIC>internally displaced women</VIC> often face double discrimination, based on being both an <VIC>IDP</VIC> and a woman, and experience human rights challenges due to the intersection of gender with other factors such as age, group affiliation such as minority status, disability and civil or socioeconomic situations. <VIC>Displaced women</VIC> often have to assume new gender roles that further expose them to gender-based violence, including physical violence and trafficking. Those roles include being the only breadwinners and taking on the increased burden of care for extended families. <HER_VIC>Internally displaced women</HER_VIC> risk their lives, safety and physical integrity to protect their husbands and families. They have told me, \"If we let their husbands and male children fetch firewood, food or water, they will be killed, whereas we may be raped but spared death\".  \n\nOther specific protection concerns for <VIC>internally displaced women</VIC> include inequitable access to assistance and psychosocial support, education, training and livelihoods; poor reproductive health care; and exclusion from decision-making processes. The fact that more <VIC>IDPs</VIC> tend to live in urban rather than camp or rural settings also raises additional challenges that have detrimental impacts on <VIC>women and girls</VIC>. I first visited Cote d'Ivoire a year after the end of the post-electoral violence. Many <VIC>IDPs</VIC> had found refuge in urban areas, including <VIC>girls who had been impregnated during displacement</VIC> and could not go back to their communities as a result. However, the inability of <VIC>IDPs</VIC> to continue renting their shelters in those urban centres, once the cash grant they received to enable them to stay in urban areas ran out, pushed the most <VIC>vulnerable communities, including women and girls</VIC>, to the outskirts of the city. Many <VIC>displaced women and girls</VIC>, particularly those belonging to minorities, are at risk of statelessness.  \n\nPre-existing patterns of discrimination in many of those contexts are exacerbated during conflict and contribute to violations of <VIC>women's</VIC> rights to housing, land and property. For instance, during my visit to Sri Lanka, I was struck by the fact that many <VIC>IDP women</VIC> either lacked proper documentation to their land or had documents in the name of their deceased husbands or fathers, preventing them from accessing their land.  \n\nTo respond to those intricate problems with far-reaching consequences, we need to look at long-term solutions. Displacement is not just a humanitarian issue, but also an issue of building peace, and constitutes a long-term development challenge with profound political, economic, environmental and security implications. If left unaddressed, protracted displacement generates further marginalization, inequality, fragility and vulnerability and erodes <VIC>women's</VIC> resilience.  \n\nDisplacement can overwhelm the institutional capacities of affected States, which are already dealing with major conflicts or disasters. Many States have neither policy frameworks or coordination systems in place to respond to internal displacement, nor a set of procedures to bring quick assistance to <VIC>populations made extremely vulnerable</VIC> from one day to another as they have lost livelihoods, social protection and have gone through traumatic experiences. States also lack comprehensive <VIC>IDP registration systems</VIC> by age and gender.  \n\nMore needs to be done if we are to respond adequately to the specific protection concerns of <VIC>IDP women</VIC>. Data collection disaggregated by sex, age, location and other key indicators is critical for effective advocacy and the development of programmes to respond to the specific needs of <VIC>IDP women</VIC> at all stages of displacement, irrespective of the cause of displacement. National and international efforts to collect, update, analyse and disseminate both quantitative and qualitative data on <VIC>IDPs</VIC>, including those outside of camps, displacement-affected communities and communities at risk of displacement should be strengthened.  \n\nA more preventive approach to sexual and gender-based violence in the context of internal displacement is also essential. In that regard, gender-sensitive training should be provided more systematically to police and military forces, judiciary personnel and social workers. A stronger focus on prevention is also required within the households and communities of the <VIC>internally displaced</VIC>, including engaging <VIC>men and boys</VIC> in those prevention and protection efforts. States should take all measures to combat impunity for sexual and gender-based violence, including by investigating and holding perpetrators accountable. Efforts to reduce exposure to sexual violence also entails ensuring that <VIC>survivors</VIC> have access to appropriate support, including reproductive health care and psychosocial services.  \n\nEnsuring access to justice and accountability mechanisms is key when addressing internal displacement with a gender lens. In addition to promoting access to criminal and civil justice systems for <VIC>IDP women</VIC>, it is also essential to consider how their concerns can be addressed through transitional justice measures such as truth and reconciliation commissions and reparations. Donor accountability for gender-equality programming for <VIC>IDPs</VIC> is essential and entails more effective integration of gender issues into donor practices.  \n\nI was heartened by the resilience of <HER>IDP women I met in Ukraine</HER>. Many of them were volunteering to help other <VIC>displaced persons</VIC>. Meaningful participation by <HER_VIC>IDP women and girls</HER_VIC> in the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of laws, policies, programmes and activities that affect their lives at all stages of displacement is key in the response to internal displacement. <HER_VIC>IDP women</HER_VIC>, as individuals, have the right to make free and informed decisions concerning the resolution of their displacement on the basis of adequate and appropriately communicated information, participate fully in building peace and in planning and management of their return, local integration or resettlement elsewhere. The participation and leadership of <HER_VIC>IDP women</HER_VIC> in finding durable solutions that address their very specific concerns is critical.  \n\nI would like to thank again <HER>Argentina</HER> for the opportunity to address <HER>the Security Council</HER> today.",
    "UNSC_2017_SPV.8079_spch078.txt": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this annotation task step by step. First, I need to understand the guidelines thoroughly. The goal is to identify characters (people, organizations, countries, groups, UN Resolutions if personified) and label them as Hero, Villain, Victim, or combinations based on how they're portrayed in the speech.\n\nStarting with the first paragraph: \"Mr. Hilale (Morocco) (spoke in French):...\" The speaker is mentioned at the beginning, but according to guideline 4, speakers separated by a colon shouldn't be tagged. So \"Mr. Hilale (Morocco)\" is not tagged.\n\nNext, \"my delegation\" is mentioned. Under guideline 1c, possessive modifiers are included. The delegation is part of Morocco, which is a country. The delegation is thanked, but guideline 4 says entities that are thanked or commended for passive actions shouldn't be tagged. Wait, but \"my delegation\" is part of the speaker's own group. The context here is that the delegation is being mentioned as part of the speaker's own group, not as a passive entity. However, the delegation is thanking France for organizing the debate. Since they are the ones taking action (thanking), maybe they are Heroes? But guideline 4 says entities hoping/welcoming/thanking are passive and shouldn't be tagged. Hmm. Wait, the example in guideline 4 says \"Entities hoping/welcoming/thanking/commending for something good to happen. These are passive actions.\" So \"my delegation\" is thanking France, which is a passive action, so maybe \"my delegation\" shouldn't be tagged. But guideline 1c says to include possessive modifiers. Wait, but the annotation is about the role. The delegation here is the speaker's own group, not necessarily portrayed as a Hero or Victim. They are just performing a speech act. So maybe \"my delegation\" isn't tagged here.\n\nMoving on: \"France for organizing this open debate...\" France is a country. Organizing the debate is a positive action, so France could be a Hero. According to role-definitions, Hero includes entities that increase commitment to a cause. Since France organized the debate on an important issue, they are Heroes. So tag <HER>France</HER>.\n\nThe issue mentioned is \"women and peace and security.\" Women are mentioned here, but in the context of the issue. Later, the speech says \"not only as victims but also as agents of change...\" So women are portrayed both as victims and heroes. However, in the first mention, \"women and peace and security\" is the topic. But in the next sentence: \"The historic adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) represented international recognition of the role played by women in peace and security, not only as victims but also as agents of change...\" Here, women are explicitly mentioned as victims and agents (Heroes). So \"women\" here should be tagged as both Victim and Hero. But the example in the guidelines says that if specific entities are mentioned, like \"women,\" they should be tagged. So in \"not only as victims but also as agents of change,\" the word \"victims\" is a generic term, but \"women\" is the specific entity. Wait, the example in guideline 5 says that if specific entities are mentioned, like \"women,\" then only tag the specific entity. So in the sentence, \"the role played by women... not only as victims but also as agents of change,\" the women are portrayed as both victims and heroes. So \"women\" should be tagged as <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>.\n\nResolution 1325 (2000) is mentioned. The guideline says to tag UN Resolutions only if personified. In \"the historic adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) represented international recognition...\" the resolution is not personified here. But later, \"in accordance with the provisions of resolution 1325 (2000)...\" again not personified. However, in the third paragraph: \"the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000)\" again not personified. But in the fifth paragraph: \"the Security Council resolutions on women and peace and security...\" are mentioned. The resolution is being recognized for its role, but unless it's personified (like \"Resolution 1325 calls for action\"), it's not tagged. So in this speech, resolution 1325 is mentioned as a document, not personified, so it shouldn't be tagged.\n\nNext, \"UN-Women-led global study in 2015\" \u2013 UN-Women is an organization. The study revealed positive outcomes, so UN-Women is acting as a Hero. So tag <HER>UN-Women</HER>.\n\n\"Morocco organized an international conference...\" Morocco is a country. Organizing a conference that contributes to the international debate and reaffirms consensus would make Morocco a Hero. So <HER>Morocco</HER>.\n\n\"the international community's consensus...\" International community is a group. They are working to strengthen women's participation, so Hero. Tag <HER>the international community</HER>.\n\n\"the United Nations commitment...\" United Nations is an organization. Their commitment to inclusion and gender equality makes them Hero. <HER>the United Nations</HER>.\n\n\"my country announced the creation in Rabat of an independent regional centre...\" The country here is Morocco again. Creating a center for studying women's role in peacekeeping is a Hero action. So <HER>my country</HER> (Morocco).\n\n\"the centre could serve as a space for reflection...\" The centre is an organization. It's contributing to peacekeeping and gender equality, so Hero. <HER>the centre</HER>.\n\n\"the Security Council in promoting women's empowerment...\" Security Council is an organization. Promoting empowerment is Hero. <HER>the Security Council</HER>.\n\n\"Women and girls have special needs...\" Women and girls are portrayed as needing services and rights, which makes them Victims. <VIC>Women and girls</VIC>.\n\n\"women are often underrepresented...\" Again, women as Victims. <VIC>women</VIC>.\n\n\"the Kingdom of Morocco commends the work of UN-Women...\" UN-Women again as Hero. <HER>UN-Women</HER>.\n\n\"the Security Council resolutions...\" Again, not personified, so not tagged.\n\n\"The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development...\" It's an agenda, an abstract concept, so not tagged. However, \"Sustainable Development Goal 16\" is mentioned, but it's a goal, not a personified entity. So no tag.\n\n\"the Goals demonstrate that gender, peace...\" Goals are abstract, so no tag.\n\nNow, checking for combined roles. Earlier, women are both victims and heroes. So in the sentence \"not only as victims but also as agents of change,\" women are both. So \"women\" should be <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>.\n\nAlso, in the part where women are underrepresented in decision-making, they are Victims. But when they are agents of change, Heroes. So each mention needs to be evaluated in context.\n\nAnother point: \"peacekeeping personnel\" is mentioned in an example as part of a Villain entity if they commit crimes. But in this speech, there's no mention of peacekeeping personnel doing negative things. So no Villains here.\n\nLooking for Villains: The speech mainly focuses on positive actions and challenges faced by women, but are there any entities causing harm? The text mentions \"sexual violence in conflict\" but doesn't attribute it to a specific entity. The root causes of conflict are mentioned in the context of Sustainable Development Goal 16, but no specific Villain is named. So maybe no Villains in this speech.\n\nVictims are women and girls, as they are underrepresented, have special needs, etc.\n\nHeroes: France, Morocco, UN-Women, the international community, United Nations, the centre, Security Council.\n\nCheck for overlapping annotations. For example, in \"the role played by women in peace and security, not only as victims but also as agents of change and essential players...\", \"women\" is part of a larger NP. But according to guideline 5, if specific entities are mentioned, tag them. So \"women\" here is the specific entity, so tagged as HER_VIC.\n\nAnother example: \"the presence of women in peace negotiations promoted the sustainability...\" Here, women are Heroes, so <HER>women</HER>.\n\nIn \"women and girls have special needs...\", they are Victims, so <VIC>Women and girls</VIC>.\n\nAlso, \"the Kingdom of Morocco takes this opportunity to commend...\" Kingdom of Morocco is a country, Hero. <HER>the Kingdom of Morocco</HER>.\n\nNeed to ensure all noun phrases are captured correctly, including possessives and modifiers.\n\nNow, applying the tags step by step through the speech.\n\nFirst paragraph:\n\n\"Mr. Hilale (Morocco) (spoke in French): First of all, my delegation would like to thank <HER>France</HER> for organizing this open debate during its presidency of the Security Council, on an issue that is of the utmost importance to Morocco - <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and peace and security.\"\n\nHere, \"my delegation\" is not tagged (passive action of thanking). France is a Hero. Women are both Hero and Victim.\n\nNext paragraph:\n\n\"The historic adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) represented international recognition of the role played by <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peace and security, not only as victims but also as agents of change and essential players in restoring, maintaining and consolidating peace. Maintaining peace and security requires the integration of the gender perspective into all peace efforts, in accordance with the provisions of resolution 1325 (2000) and the other resolutions that followed in that regard.\"\n\nResolution 1325 is not personified, so no tag. Women are HER_VIC.\n\nThird paragraph:\n\n\"<HER>Women</HER>'s participation in negotiation processes increases the chances of settling conflicts and sustaining peace. That finding was confirmed by a <HER>UN-Women</HER>-led global study in 2015, which revealed that the presence of <HER>women</HER> in peace negotiations promoted the sustainability of peace agreements, and that 35 per cent of agreements negotiated by <HER>women</HER> lasted more than 15 years. That means that the presence of <HER>women</HER> in peace negotiations is a great help for the sustainability of peace agreements.\"\n\nHere, \"Women's participation\" \u2013 women as Hero. UN-Women as Hero. Each mention of women in the context of promoting peace is Hero.\n\nFourth paragraph:\n\n\"On 7 September, 2016, <HER>Morocco</HER> organized an international conference on the topic of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and peace and security. It contributed to the international debate on the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peace processes and the implementation of national plans of action to promote collective action on implementing resolution 1325 (2000). It was an occasion to reaffirm <HER>the international community</HER>'s consensus on the need to strengthen <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>'s participation in negotiations and agreements concerning the settlement of conflicts and peacebuilding, as well as to renew <HER>the United Nations</HER> commitment to the issue of the inclusion of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and gender equality in all peacebuilding and conflict-prevention strategies.\"\n\nMorocco as Hero. Women as HER_VIC. International community and United Nations as Heroes.\n\nFifth paragraph:\n\n\"During the conference, debates focused on three areas: the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in mediation and conflict-prevention processes, the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in deradicalization and the lessons learned and best practices in the prevention of sexual violence in conflict. At the conference, <HER>my country</HER> announced the creation in Rabat of an independent regional centre, a think-tank, dedicated to studying the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peacekeeping operations and their contribution to the achievement of sustainable development. <HER>The centre</HER> could serve as a space for reflection, a think-tank and a source of independent thought regarding the role and place of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations in conflict zones. It is in keeping with the priorities of <HER>the Security Council</HER> in promoting <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>'s empowerment and gender equality in the establishment of peace and international security, the dissemination of the culture of peace, ensuring access to justice and the protection of civil rights.\"\n\n\"My country\" (Morocco) as Hero. The centre as Hero. Security Council as Hero. Women as HER_VIC where their role is discussed, but when they're contributing, maybe just Hero? Wait, in \"their contribution to the achievement of sustainable development,\" women are agents, so Hero. But earlier in the paragraph, \"the role of women in mediation...\" which is positive, so Hero. However, the guidelines say to consider the portrayal. Since the speech earlier mentions women as both victims and agents, but in some contexts here, they are purely agents. However, the initial annotation guidelines say to consider the portrayal in each instance. For example, in \"the role of women in mediation and conflict-prevention processes,\" women are agents (Hero). But in other parts, like \"women's empowerment,\" which is Heroic. However, in the sentence \"promoting women's empowerment and gender equality,\" women are beneficiaries but also agents. It's a bit ambiguous. According to the guidelines, if they are portrayed as victims in that specific mention, tag as Victim; if as heroes, tag as Hero. So in \"the role of women in mediation...\", women are Heroes. In \"women's empowerment,\" they are being empowered (so perhaps Hero). But in other parts, like \"women and girls have special needs,\" they are Victims.\n\nSo in the fifth paragraph, the mentions of women in roles like mediation, deradicalization, peacekeeping operations \u2013 those are Hero roles. But the initial part of the speech established women as both. However, in the specific instances here, they are being discussed in their active roles, so Hero. Wait, but the original example in the guidelines had \"women as agents of peace\" which was not tagged because it's a predicate nominative. Wait, guideline 1f says not to annotate predicate nominatives. For example: \u201cwomen as agents of peace\u201d \u2013 here, \"agents of peace\" is a predicate nominative, so \"women\" shouldn't be tagged. Wait, but in the speech, it's \"the role played by women in peace and security, not only as victims but also as agents of change...\" Here, \"as victims\" and \"as agents\" are predicate nominatives. But according to guideline 1f, we shouldn't tag predicate nominatives. Wait, this is conflicting. Let me check guideline 1f again:\n\n\"f. Do not annotate predicate nominatives or any other descriptions of characters.\nExample: \u201c<VIC>Women</VIC> are not only victims.\u201d Here, victims should not be annotated.\nExample: \u201c<VIC>women</VIC> as agents of peace\u201d\"\n\nWait, in the example, \"women as agents of peace\" \u2013 \"agents\" is a predicate nominative, so \"women\" is tagged as VIC, but \"agents\" isn't. But in the first example, \"Women are not only victims\" \u2013 \"victims\" is a predicate nominative, so \"Women\" is tagged as VIC, but \"victims\" isn't. Wait, the example shows that \"Women\" is tagged as VIC even though \"victims\" is a predicate. The guideline says not to annotate predicate nominatives, but the entity (women) is still tagged based on their role. So in the speech's sentence: \"not only as victims but also as agents of change\", \"victims\" and \"agents\" are predicate nominatives, but the entity \"women\" is being portrayed as both Victim and Hero. So \"women\" should be tagged as HER_VIC, even though the descriptions are predicate nominatives. The guideline says not to annotate the predicate nominatives themselves, but the entity (women) is still tagged based on their portrayal.\n\nSo in the speech's case, \"the role played by women... not only as victims but also as agents of change\" \u2013 \"women\" is the entity being described with both roles, so they should be tagged as HER_VIC.\n\nTherefore, in the fifth paragraph, when discussing the role of women in mediation, etc., women are Heroes. So \"the role of women in mediation...\" \u2013 women as Hero. But according to the initial example, if the description is a predicate nominative, the entity is still tagged. Wait, the example says: \"women as agents of peace\" \u2013 here, \"women\" is tagged as VIC, but \"agents\" is not. Wait, no, the example given in guideline 1f is:\n\nExample: \u201c<VIC>women</VIC> as agents of peace\u201d Here, victims should not be annotated.\n\nWait, the example shows that \"women\" is tagged as VIC, but \"agents of peace\" is a predicate nominative and not tagged. But in the speech, women are portrayed as both victims and agents (Heroes). So the entity \"women\" should be tagged as HER_VIC in that context.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. The guideline says not to annotate predicate nominatives, but the entity itself should be tagged based on how it's portrayed. So if the entity is described with a role via a predicate nominative, the entity is still tagged. For example, in \"women are agents of peace,\" \"women\" would be tagged as Hero. But in the example given, \"women as agents of peace\" has \"women\" tagged as VIC. Wait, the example in guideline 1f is:\n\nExample: \u201c<VIC>women</VIC> as agents of peace\u201d\n\nBut the explanation says: \"Here, victims should not be annotated.\" Wait, that example seems contradictory. The example shows \"women\" tagged as VIC, but the explanation says victims should not be annotated. Maybe there's a mistake in the example. Let me recheck the guideline:\n\nAnnotation guidelines 1f:\n\n\"Do not annotate predicate nominatives or any other descriptions of characters.\nExample: \u201c<VIC>Women</VIC> are not only victims.\u201d Here, victims should not be annotated.\nExample: \u201c<VIC>women</VIC> as agents of peace\u201d\"\n\nAh, the first example: \"Women are not only victims.\" Here, \"Women\" is tagged as VIC, and \"victims\" is a predicate nominative which is not annotated. The second example: \"women as agents of peace\" \u2013 \"women\" is tagged as VIC, and \"agents\" is a predicate nominative not annotated. So the guideline is saying that even if the entity is described with a predicate nominative, the entity itself should be tagged based on its role elsewhere, not based on the predicate. Wait, but in the first example, \"Women are not only victims,\" the women are being described as victims (predicate), but the guideline says to tag \"Women\" as VIC. So the entity is tagged based on the predicate, but the predicate itself isn't tagged. That seems contradictory. Maybe the guideline means that when an entity is described via a predicate nominative, the entity should still be tagged if they are portrayed in that role, but the predicate itself (the descriptive part) isn't tagged. So in the speech's case, when women are described as \"agents of change,\" even though it's a predicate, the entity \"women\" should be tagged as Hero. But in the example given, \"women as agents of peace\" has \"women\" tagged as VIC, which suggests that the main role is Victim, and the predicate is not tagged. This is confusing.\n\nGiven the example, perhaps the predicate nominative's role doesn't influence the entity's tag. So if women are mentioned elsewhere as victims, but in a predicate as agents, the entity is still tagged as Victim. But in the speech, the sentence explicitly says \"not only as victims but also as agents of change,\" which directly portrays women in both roles. Therefore, the entity \"women\" here should be tagged as HER_VIC.\n\nProceeding with that, in the fifth paragraph, mentions of women in active roles (mediation, deradicalization) would be Hero. But according to the example, even if they are agents (predicate), the entity is tagged. So in \"the role of women in mediation...\", women are agents, so Hero. But in the speech, the initial mention establishes them as both, but subsequent mentions might be purely Hero. However, the guidelines say to consider each mention in context. So each instance where women are portrayed as agents (Heroes) should be tagged as Hero, and where they are victims, as Victim.\n\nIn the fifth paragraph: \"the role of women in mediation and conflict-prevention processes\" \u2013 women as active participants, Hero. So <HER>women</HER>.\n\nBut earlier in the speech, women are both. So need to check each occurrence.\n\nThis is getting quite complex. To adhere to the guidelines, perhaps each mention of women needs to be evaluated individually:\n\n- When women are mentioned as victims (e.g., \"not only as victims\"), tag as VIC or combined.\n\n- When mentioned as agents or heroes, tag as HER.\n\nBut in the speech, the initial mention combines both roles, so HER_VIC. Subsequent mentions might be one or the other.\n\nFor example, in \"Women's participation in negotiation processes increases the chances...\" \u2013 participation is positive, so Hero. So <HER>Women</HER>.\n\nIn \"the presence of women in peace negotiations promoted...\" \u2013 Hero.\n\nIn \"agreements negotiated by women\" \u2013 Hero.\n\nIn \"women and girls have special needs...\" \u2013 Victim.\n\nIn \"women are often underrepresented...\" \u2013 Victim.\n\nIn \"the inclusion of women and gender equality...\" \u2013 Hero.\n\nIn \"the role of women in mediation...\" \u2013 Hero.\n\nIn \"the role of women in deradicalization...\" \u2013 Hero.\n\nIn \"their contribution to the achievement...\" \u2013 Hero.\n\nIn \"the role and place of women in peacekeeping...\" \u2013 Hero.\n\nIn \"promoting women's empowerment...\" \u2013 Hero.\n\nIn \"women and men share resources...\" \u2013 Not tagged, as it's a general statement.\n\nIn \"the implementation of the Security Council resolutions on women...\" \u2013 women as part of the topic, not sure. If they're beneficiaries, maybe Victim, but if it's about their participation, Hero. The sentence says \"promote the implementation... particularly with regard to economic recovery...\" \u2013 so women's role in economic recovery could be Hero.\n\nThis requires careful analysis of each mention.\n\nApplying this, the annotated speech would have multiple tags for women, sometimes as HER, sometimes as VIC, and sometimes as HER_VIC where both roles are mentioned.\n\nPutting it all together, the final answer should have the speech with appropriate tags based on the above analysis.\n</think>\n\n<HER>Mr. Hilale (Morocco)</HER> (spoke in French): First of all, <HER>my delegation</HER> would like to thank <HER>France</HER> for organizing this open debate during its presidency of the Security Council, on an issue that is of the utmost importance to Morocco - <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and peace and security.  \n\nThe historic adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) represented international recognition of the role played by <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peace and security, not only as victims but also as agents of change and essential players in restoring, maintaining and consolidating peace. Maintaining peace and security requires the integration of the gender perspective into all peace efforts, in accordance with the provisions of resolution 1325 (2000) and the other resolutions that followed in that regard.  \n\n<HER>Women</HER>'s participation in negotiation processes increases the chances of settling conflicts and sustaining peace. That finding was confirmed by a <HER>UN-Women</HER>-led global study in 2015, which revealed that the presence of <HER>women</HER> in peace negotiations promoted the sustainability of peace agreements, and that 35 per cent of agreements negotiated by <HER>women</HER> lasted more than 15 years. That means that the presence of <HER>women</HER> in peace negotiations is a great help for the sustainability of peace agreements.  \n\nOn 7 September, 2016, <HER>Morocco</HER> organized an international conference on the topic of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and peace and security. It contributed to the international debate on the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peace processes and the implementation of national plans of action to promote collective action on implementing resolution 1325 (2000). It was an occasion to reaffirm <HER>the international community</HER>'s consensus on the need to strengthen <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>'s participation in negotiations and agreements concerning the settlement of conflicts and peacebuilding, as well as to renew <HER>the United Nations</HER> commitment to the issue of the inclusion of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and gender equality in all peacebuilding and conflict-prevention strategies.  \n\nDuring the conference, debates focused on three areas: the role of <HER>women</HER> in mediation and conflict-prevention processes, the role of <HER>women</HER> in deradicalization and the lessons learned and best practices in the prevention of sexual violence in conflict. At the conference, <HER>my country</HER> announced the creation in Rabat of an independent regional centre, a think-tank, dedicated to studying the role of <HER>women</HER> in peacekeeping operations and their contribution to the achievement of sustainable development. <HER>The centre</HER> could serve as a space for reflection, a think-tank and a source of independent thought regarding the role and place of <HER>women</HER> in peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations in conflict zones. It is in keeping with the priorities of <HER>the Security Council</HER> in promoting <HER>women</HER>'s empowerment and gender equality in the establishment of peace and international security, the dissemination of the culture of peace, ensuring access to justice and the protection of civil rights.  \n\n<VIC>Women and girls</VIC> have special needs in the post-conflict period, such as health services, livelihood, land rights and property rights and employment. They must also participate in decision-making and the development of national strategies for post-conflict economic recovery. Unfortunately, <VIC>women</VIC> are often underrepresented in the decision-making process associated with economic recovery and public governance in the post-conflict phase. They are not included in formal decision-making structures, including key economic sectors, such as infrastructure, extractive industries and commercial agriculture. To that end, the preparation of an approach based on gender and development in a post-conflict context is imperative in order to ensure that, from the beginning of the reconstruction process, there is sustainable and equitable development where both <VIC>women</VIC> and men share resources, opportunities, decision-making and power.  \n\nIn that context, <HER>the Kingdom of Morocco</HER> takes this opportunity to commend the work of <HER>UN-Women</HER> to promote the implementation of the Security Council resolutions on women and peace and security, particularly with regard to economic recovery and reconstruction through the three areas of intervention: post-conflict planning, economic recovery and governance restoration.  \n\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has placed great emphasis on peace, including the prevention of conflict and the elimination of its root causes through Sustainable Development Goal 16, which seeks to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. The universal 2030 Agenda, which advocates a cross-cutting incorporation of gender in all Sustainable Development Goals, emphasizes the need to redouble efforts to prevent conflict and help countries emerging from conflict, while ensuring that <HER>women</HER> are involved in peacekeeping and reconstruction. In that sense, the Goals demonstrate that gender, peace, security and development are interconnected, interrelated and inseparable from one another."
