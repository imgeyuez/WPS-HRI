    "UNSC_2000_SPV.4208_spch004.txt": "Ms. King: I am particularly honoured today, as  Special Adviser on Gender Issues, to have the  opportunity to speak in this debate, which is so  historic, when for the first time the Council has decided  to devote an entire open discussion to the topic  \"Women and peace and security\".    It is only fairly recently that the experience of  <VIC>women and girls</VIC> in armed conflict has been discussed,  and then discussion has usually concentrated on their  role as <VIC>victims</VIC>. Today's debate will show that we have  come a long way in a relatively short time. Your  country's strong leadership, <HER>Mr. President</HER>, in holding  the landmark May seminar which marked this year's  tenth anniversary of the United Nations Transition  Assistance Group resulted in the historic Windhoek  Declaration and Namibia Plan of Action on  \"Mainstreaming a Gender Perspective in  Multidimensional Peace Support Operations\". This  achievement has won universal admiration among all  those fighting for <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> right to participate in all  aspects of the peace process. It and your distinguished  chairing of the General Assembly's twenty-third  special session, \"Women 2000: gender equality,  development and peace for the twenty-first century\",  which immediately followed in June, constitute  important steps along the way to considering the  United Nations peace operations from the point of view  of both <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and <HER>men</HER>.    Other important developments have led to today's  meeting. They include the Council's decision to take a  thematic approach to its work; the recognition that the  Council gave - under the chair of <HER>Bangladesh</HER> - on  International Women's Day, 8 March, to <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> as  actors in the peace process; the discussion on the  situation of <VIC>women</VIC> in Afghanistan, which took place in  April, led by the representative of <HER>Canada</HER>; and the  Council's resolution 1314 (2000) of 11 August.    The timeliness of this discussion is also  significant. <HER>The Secretary-General</HER> has just returned  from an area where he undoubtedly had an opportunity  to see at first hand the role <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and <HER>men</HER> should  play in their societies to bring about peace and to  rebuild those societies. The discussion also coincides  with the consideration of <HER>the Brahimi Panel's</HER> report  (8/2000/809) on peace operations and its  implementation.    There are three broad areas to be considered in  the context of today's discussion: how armed conflict  affects <VIC>women</VIC>; how <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> actually respond to  conflict, the peace process and post-conflict  reconstruction; and how we plan strategically for a  future in which <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> are equal partners with <HER>men</HER> in  enhancing our effectiveness in peace operations.    Today I would like to concentrate on the two  latter points, drawing on my experience as Chief of  Mission in <HER>the United Nations Observer Mission in  South Africa (UNOMSA)</HER>.    What do <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> actually do in conflict situations,  and how do they respond? <HER>The Secretary-General</HER> has  repeatedly emphasized the changing nature of war. He  has noted that modern warfare is increasingly  conducted within, rather than between, States, and that  <HER>the Security Council</HER> is now called on to deal with such  conflicts. He has stressed that more and more non-State  actors are protagonists in armed conflict; even <VIC>children</VIC> become involved. The proliferation of small arms and  the ease with which they can be acquired, clearly  shown in <HER>the Department for Disarmament Affairs</HER> and <HER>the Department of Public Information</HER> video documentary  \"Armed to the Teeth\", has also added a new dimension.    The socio-economic fabric of a country has now  to be the major focus of attention. Societal dynamics  thus become a key guide to finding entry points into  resolving disputes. Groups within each society, and  especially <HER_VIC>women's groups</HER_VIC>, non-governmental,  religious and other groups, have a major role to play.  Whether these groups were formed before the conflict  or during it is not important. What is important is that  they must be part of all stages of the peace  negotiations, in planning for the future, in rebuilding  and in crafting preventive strategies to avoid conflict.    Often, those of us who have seen the value of  <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> participation in peace operations at first hand  are challenged by the sceptics to present empirical  rather than anecdotal findings. In this connection, I am  pleased to report on the results of a joint three-year  effort of <HER>the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO)</HER>, <HER>my office</HER> and <HER>the Division for the  Advancement of Women of the Department of  Economic and Social Affairs</HER>, a study that was  supported by the generous funding of several <HER>Member States</HER>. This study, \"Mainstreaming a Gender  Perspective in Multidimensional Peace Operations\" has  just been finalized.  The study looks at five peace operations, in  <HER>Bosnia and Herzegovina</HER>, <HER>Cambodia</HER>, <HER>El Salvador</HER>, <HER>Namibia</HER> and <HER>South Africa</HER>. It answers the sceptics by  giving objective and empirical findings on what  <HER_VIC>women staff</HER_VIC> do in missions; whether and how they  influence the outcomes; and how their participating  equally with <HER>men</HER> can improve the efficiency of United  Nations peacekeeping. <HER>The Windhoek Declaration</HER> and  <HER>the Namibia Plan of Action</HER> were informed by these  findings.    Exactly what does this study tell us? It shows  unequivocally that when there is a critical mass of  <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in a mission - at least 30 per cent - local  <VIC>women</VIC> are more easily mobilized to join peace  committees. This occurred in <HER>South Africa</HER>, <HER>El Salvador</HER> and <HER>Namibia</HER>, where <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> actively promoted voter  education and the rights of individual <VIC>women</VIC> to vote.  In other words, <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> participation in United  Nations missions empowers local <VIC>women</VIC> and may  inspire them to organize for the achievement of a  democratic society.    <HER_VIC>Women's</HER_VIC> participation has the capacity to expand  the debate a little further so that it may encompass  more diverse subjects, including those that may be  more relevant to <VIC>women and children</VIC>. <HER_VIC>Women</HER_VIC> are  frequently less hierarchical in dealing with local  communities and listen more, thereby having better  insights into the root causes of conflict. Local <VIC>women</VIC> are more likely to confide in <HER_VIC>women peacekeepers</HER_VIC> on  such matters as rape and other sexual violence. The  presence of a critical mass of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> appears to foster  confidence and trust among the local population, and  this is critical to successful operations, such as in <HER>El Salvador</HER>. <HER_VIC>Women</HER_VIC> are active negotiators and able to see  more clearly issues that affect <VIC>women</VIC> differently than <VIC>men</VIC>.    <HER_VIC>Women's</HER_VIC> participation in all aspects of a mission  can help to break down stereotypes held by <VIC>women</VIC> in  many local communities, especially where <HER_VIC>women peacekeepers</HER_VIC> serve in a broad spectrum of the activities  of a mission. This has had a spin-off effect on the  participation of local <VIC>women</VIC> in decision-making  positions. <HER_VIC>Women</HER_VIC> political monitors are just as willing  and capable of serving in dangerous or isolated areas as  <HER>men</HER>, and do so just as effectively.    The study also shows that mixed teams of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and <HER>men</HER>, a significant proportion of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> team leaders, <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> special representatives or heads of  mission, or a conscious effort by a special  representative to seek the best staff, whether <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> or <HER>men</HER>, has a positive influence on the outcome. <HER_VIC>Women</HER_VIC> also respond by participating in the troop-contributing  countries' military and civilian police contingents. <HER>The Department of Peacekeeping Operations</HER> has made  strenuous efforts to encourage <HER>Member States</HER> to send  <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> on missions, on the basis of equity, as their  presence can assist in defusing potentially tense  situations. Much more should be done in order to  encourage <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> to enter this service.    What do this and other studies tell us about what  local <VIC>women</VIC> do? There is abundant evidence to show  that even when having to flee to safety with their  families or protecting them in refugee or displaced-  persons camps, <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> take on a number of peace-  building activities.    <HER_VIC>Women</HER_VIC> are active at both formal and informal  levels. With few exceptions, <VIC>women</VIC> are not present in  formal peace negotiations. However, <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> have been  part of these negotiations, as we saw in the field in  <HER>Burundi</HER>, and in <HER>Guatemala</HER> and <HER>South Africa</HER>. <HER_VIC>Somali women</HER_VIC> helped to bring the clan leaders back into the  negotiations at one stage and were permitted to join the  negotiations as observers.    Most of the activities, however, take place at the  informal level. Grass-roots <HER_VIC>women's organizations</HER_VIC> in  several countries have sponsored peace education;  encouraged child soldiers to lay down arms; organized  groups advocating peace across party and ethnic lines;  organized campaigns against small arms, such as <HER>the Organization of African Unity (OAU) African  Women's Committee</HER> on peace and development;  influenced repatriation processes and established  services for returning exiles, such as in <HER>Guatemala</HER>;  contributed to ending conflict; negotiated the release of  hostages; and established legal support groups to get  recognition for <VIC>women's</VIC> rights to land and household  property which may have been in the name of a spouse  killed or \"disappeared\" in a conflict.    <HER_VIC>Women</HER_VIC> at the local level are a rich resource  waiting to be systematically tapped by <HER>the international community</HER>. Many aspects of these informal activities  have been encouraged, supported financially and  documented by <HER>the United Nations</HER> and its agencies. In  this connection, in addition to the work of <HER>the Department of Peacekeeping Operations</HER>, <HER>the Department of Political Affairs</HER>, <HER>the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</HER> and <HER>the Department for Disarmament Affairs</HER> should be  mentioned. Special mention should also be made of the  work of <HER>the Office of the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees</HER>, <HER>the Office of the High  Commissioner for Human Rights</HER>, <HER>the United Nations  Children's Fund</HER>, <HER>the World Food Programme</HER> and <HER>the World Health Organization</HER>. <HER>The United Nations  Development Programme (UNDP)</HER>, <HER>the United Nations  Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM)</HER> and <HER>the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements  (Habitat)</HER> should also be credited with pioneering work  at the national and grass-roots levels. Good practices  have been identified, studied and published, including  the study by <HER>the United Nations Research Institute for  Social Development</HER>, \"Women and Post-Conflict  Reconstruction\". The exchange of information on these  practices has enabled <HER>the United Nations system</HER> to  encourage States engaged in rehabilitation to work in  partnership with and sustain <HER_VIC>women's groups</HER_VIC> and civil  society engaged in these essential but often  unrecognized activities. Capacity-building for  leadership and governance led by <HER>UNDP</HER> and <HER>UNIFEM</HER> has greatly facilitated <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> ability to play  constructive roles.    These entities are all members of <HER>the Administrative Committee on Coordination's Inter-  Agency Committee on Women and Gender Equality</HER>,  which I chair. We have lately formed a Task Force on  <HER_VIC>Women</HER_VIC> and Peace and Security to strengthen  collaboration on this critical issue.    This brings me to our vision for the future. The  basic blueprint appears in <HER>the Beijing Platform for  Action</HER>, <HER>the Beijing + 5 outcome document</HER>, <HER>the Windhoek Declaration</HER> and <HER>the Namibia Plan of Action</HER>.  It also appears in the many powerful statements from  <HER_VIC>women's groups</HER_VIC> that we heard yesterday in <HER>the Council's Arria-formula meeting</HER>.    The planning of any mission must include gender  equality aspects. The mandate of the mission and the  guidelines for special representatives must clearly  indicate that gender considerations must be integrated  into the mission's goals and the head of mission be  accountable. Each mission should have a plan for  incorporating gender issues into all aspects of the  mission's work. There should be a gender unit,  adequately staffed and resourced to provide the  necessary backstopping on the mission site, and one in  <HER>DPKO</HER> for overall oversight. I am pleased to state that  <HER>DPKO</HER> has established two such units- one in <HER>East Timor</HER> and one in <HER>Kosovo</HER> - and gender focal points in <HER>Sierra Leone</HER> and <HER>Western Sahara</HER>. All sectors of the  transition or rebuilding process should take gender  issues into account. Greater attention must be paid to  ensuring the appointment of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> as special  representatives, in accordance with <HER>the Brahimi report</HER> and the call by <HER_VIC>women heads of State and Government</HER> of 5 September. <HER>The Council</HER> may wish to ensure that  all the reports that it receives on missions contain  information and data on the extent to which a gender  perspective has been introduced and on the number and  level of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> working in the various missions.  Working with <HER>the agencies</HER> on the ground, <HER>the political</HER> and development wings of the mission should organize  the mobilization of community groups, especially  <HER_VIC>women's groups</HER_VIC>, and expand the pool of skills needed  to sustain the peace process. A roster of such groups  could be kept by <HER>DPKO</HER>, in collaboration with regional  bodies and agencies. The code of conduct for  peacekeepers should be regularly updated and where  there are infringements, there should be a continuation  of apprehension and discipline. Should it be decided to  appoint a new assistant secretary-general in <HER>the Department of Peacekeeping Operations</HER>, as proposed  in <HER>the Panel's report</HER>, strong consideration should be  given to appointing a <HER_VIC>woman</HER_VIC> to one of the three  assistant secretary-general posts in <HER>the Department</HER>.    In closing, may I recall the main finding of the  joint study made by <HER>the Department of Peacekeeping Operations</HER> and <HER>the Division for the Advancement of Women</HER>. It was that the most important lesson learned  is that lessons are not always learned. Lessons from  <HER>Namibia</HER> and <HER>South Africa</HER> had little effect on  <HER>Cambodia</HER> or <HER>Bosnia Herzegovina</HER>, for example. Gender  equality issues are absolutely essential to the success of  any peace operation. We cannot exclude half the  world's resources from participating in peace.  The fundamental human right to have and to  enjoy equality is a given. It was emphasized by <HER>the Beijing Conference</HER> and reaffirmed again in <HER>the Beijing +5 outcome document</HER> and even more so at <HER>the Millennium Declaration</HER>. There can be no peace  without gender equality and no development without  both peace and equality. Without the equal and fair  participation of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in decision-making positions in  <HER>the United Nations</HER> and also in <HER>Member States</HER>, as well  as in this central organ of <HER>the United Nations</HER>, we will  never achieve the vision outlined in <HER>the United Nations Charter</HER>. May this discussion and the decisions that  follow be those in which we demonstrate that, at least  in the area of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and peace and security, this is one  lesson that we have learned and intend to put into  action.",
    "UNSC_2005_SPV.5294_spch027.txt": "Mr. Wang Guangya (China) (spoke in Chinese):  I wish at the outset to thank you, Mr. President, for  initiating and organizing today's meeting. I thank <HER>the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan</HER>, for his report on  the United Nations system-wide action plan  (S/2005/636). Our thanks go also to <HER>Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Guehenno</HER>, <HER>Ms. Rachel Mayanja</HER>, <HER>Ms. Noeleen Heyzer</HER> and other participants for their  presentations this morning.    In his report, <HER>the Secretary-General</HER> makes many  concrete recommendations for further implementation  by <HER>the United Nations system</HER> of resolution 1325  (2000). We welcome his recommendations and express  the hope that they can be effectively implemented.    This year marks both the fifth anniversary of the  adoption of <HER>Security Council</HER> resolution 1325 (2000)  and the tenth anniversary of <HER>the Fourth World Conference on Women</HER>, held in <HER>Beijing</HER>. Those  anniversaries lend particular significance to this open  debate on the question of <VIC>women</VIC> and peace and  security.    Five years ago <HER>the Security Council</HER> adopted  resolution 1325 (2000), which focused <HER>the international community</HER>'s attention on the question of <VIC>women</VIC> and  armed conflict and which provided guidance for the  endeavour to promote gender equality, protect <VIC>women's</VIC> rights and expand the role played by <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>. In the  five years since then - thanks to the efforts of <HER>the Secretariat</HER>, <HER>the relevant peacekeeping operations</HER>, <HER>the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women</HER>, <HER>the United Nations Development Fund for Women</HER> and <HER>Member States</HER> - much has been achieved in implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). <HER>The international community</HER> now attaches greater importance to the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in the settlement of armed conflicts, and <HER>the Department of Peacekeeping Operations</HER> has mandated  that enhanced protection of <VIC>women</VIC> be a very important  component of the daily work of <HER>peacekeeping operations</HER>. Both at Headquarters and in many  <HER>peacekeeping operations</HER>, <HER>gender advisers</HER> have been  appointed.    At the recent <HER>High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly</HER>, <HER>world leaders</HER> once again stressed  the important role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in the prevention and  resolution of conflicts and in <HER>peacebuilding</HER> and  reaffirmed their commitment to the full and effective  implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).    Five years on, when we look back on the road we  have travelled and forward to the path ahead, we can  see that a great deal of work remains to be done in  attaining the goals defined in resolution 1325 (2000).    First, we must strive to eliminate the root causes  of armed conflict and strengthen our conflict  prevention and early warning systems in order to create  an environment favourable to protecting <VIC>women</VIC> from  the harm that is caused by war. In other words, we  must cure the disease by addressing its root causes.    Secondly, crimes of sexual assault must be  punished more harshly; violence against <VIC>women</VIC> must  be more seriously investigated and its perpetrators  must be brought to justice. <HER>United Nations peacekeeping operations</HER> must continue to pursue a  zero-tolerance policy to ensure strict compliance with  rules and adherence to standards.    Thirdly, <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> should be encouraged to  participate in peace processes at all stages. In  particular, it is essential to ensure that they have  decision-making power so that the special needs and  the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> will be reflected in conflict and  post-conflict processes. <VIC>Women</VIC> are both the primary  victims of armed conflicts of all kinds and  indispensable participants in the resolution of any  conflict. Their ardent yearning for peace enables them  to play a more important role in the promotion of peace  processes.    Fourthly, a summary should be prepared of  successful experiences in protecting <VIC>women's</VIC> rights,  with a view to sharing and actively replicating them.  Efforts should be made to enhance awareness of the  need to protect <VIC>women's</VIC> rights and to ensure that  words are translated into deeds.    Fifthly, work carried out on this issue by <HER>the relevant bodies</HER> should be effectively coordinated. All  parties should be encouraged to take steps with the  strength born of collective action and to make every  effort to achieve the best possible outcome. <HER>Organs such as the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council</HER> have been considering <VIC>women's</VIC> issues  for many years and have rich experience to offer. <HER>The Security Council</HER> should coordinate its activities with theirs.    <VIC>Women</VIC> have played an important - indeed,  irreplaceable - role in the formation of human  civilization and the promotion of social development.  Progress for <VIC>women</VIC> is progress for all of humankind.  A popular Chinese saying has it that <VIC>women</VIC> hold up  half of the sky. We hope that, through our common  efforts, <VIC>mothers, wives and daughters</VIC> will no longer  shed their tears at the horrors of war and that all our  <VIC>sisters</VIC> worldwide will lead happy and peaceful lives.  We believe that our world will then be a brighter and  more beautiful place.",
    "UNSC_2010_SPV.6411_spch053.txt": "Mr. Zidar (Slovenia): I would like to thank <HER>Uganda</HER> for the initiative to convene this important  open debate on <VIC>women</VIC>, peace and security. I also thank  <HER>the Secretary-General</HER>, Under-Secretary-General for  Gender Equality and the Empowerment of <VIC>women</VIC>  Bachelet and other distinguished guests for their  presentations today.    <HER>Slovenia</HER> fully aligns itself with the statements to  be delivered by the representative of <HER>the European  Union</HER> and by the representative of <HER>Costa Rica</HER> on  behalf of <HER>the Human Security Network</HER>.    Resolution 1325 (2000) on <VIC>women</VIC>, peace and  security acknowledged that <VIC>women</VIC> are not just <VIC>victims</VIC>  of armed conflict and that their equal and full  participation is of vital importance in conflict  prevention, peacekeeping, conflict resolution,  peacebuilding and post-conflict recovery.    In the past 10 years, many activities have been  carried out to strengthen the role of <VIC>women</VIC> during and  after conflict. However, this anniversary reminds us  that despite those efforts, much needs to be done in the  protection of <VIC>women</VIC> and in the promotion of the  participation of <VIC>women</VIC> at the decision-making level, in  conflict resolution and in peace processes.    Violence against <VIC>women</VIC>, especially sexual and  gender-based violence, persists in conflicts. Recent  events in <VIC>the Democratic Republic of the Congo</VIC> have  shown that <VIC>women</VIC> continue to be deliberate targets of  injustice and sexual violence in the conflict and its  aftermath.  In his report (S/2010/498), <HER>the Secretary-General</HER>  takes up United Nations activities in the  implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). The report  shows that a vast range of activities has been carried  out in the past 10 years. However, the fragmentation of  those activities demonstrates the need to streamline and  coordinate the action of all members of <HER>the international community</HER>. <HER>Slovenia</HER> supports <HER>the Secretary-General's</HER> recommendation to develop a  single comprehensive framework that consists of an  agreed set of goals, targets and indicators to guide the  implementation of the resolution in its second decade.    We are of the opinion that the issue of <VIC>women</VIC>, peace and security needs to be addressed in a holistic  and comprehensive manner. We welcome <HER>the Security Council's</HER> decision to take forward the set of indicators  developed by <HER>the Secretary-General</HER> to track the  implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) in situations  of armed conflict as well as post-conflict and other  situations. We hope that the indicators will now  become operational.    <HER>Slovenia</HER> also supports the recommendation to  establish a dedicated working group to review progress  in the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and to  make recommendations to <HER>the Security Council</HER> on how  to address gaps and challenges to accelerate progress in  the implementation of the resolution.    Stronger steps should be taken to address  accountability and to end impunity for perpetrators of  violations. <HER>The Security Council</HER> should impose  targeted and graduated measures against all parties to a  conflict responsible for grave violations of <VIC>women's</VIC>  rights, including sexual violence. Sexual violence  should be a priority element in all Council resolutions  mandating the sanctions committees.    We all have a responsibility to implement  resolution 1325 (2000). The development of national  action plans is a key means by which Member States  commit themselves to fulfilling that responsibility. I  would like to report that <HER>Slovenia</HER> is about to finalize  and adopt such an action plan. The goal is to  interconnect existing national and international  activities addressing a broader concept of <VIC>women</VIC>, peace and security in order to translate them into  genuine political commitments, and thus accelerate the  implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and  contribute to the empowerment and protection of <VIC>women</VIC>.    In <HER>Slovenia</HER>, gender equality is a priority not only  in the field of human rights and development  cooperation but also in security and defence policy.  Since 2008, much has been done to promote gender  equality in the security and defence sector. Those  activities range from awareness-raising and training to  the adoption and modification of legislation and other  measures, including codes of conduct. The recently  adopted strategy on the participation of <HER>the Republic of  Slovenia</HER> in international operations and missions  promotes equal opportunities with regard to such  efforts at all levels, irrespective of gender.    Lastly, let me take this opportunity to encourage  <HER>the Security Council</HER> to continue to address the issue of <VIC>women</VIC>, peace and security and to seek the most  effective means to improve the situation of <VIC>women</VIC> in  armed conflict. With a comprehensive United Nations  approach and increased ownership by Member States  over their activities, the plight of <VIC>women</VIC> in situations  of armed conflict and its aftermath can be eliminated.",
    "UNSC_2014_SPV.7289_spch006.txt": "Mr. Beyani: I would like to thank the Permanent  Mission of <HER>Argentina</HER> and the other members of the  Security Council for holding this open debate on  the critical issue of displaced <VIC>women and girls</VIC> in  the framework of the <HER>women and peace and security</HER> agenda. The intersection of peace and security, human  rights and development is critical to dealing with the  issue of internal displacement. We must not lose sight  of the important role that internally displaced <VIC>women</VIC> can play in negotiating peace, ensuring their human  rights and bringing about development in post-conflict  situations.    As part of my mandate, I enter into dialogue with  Governments and the international community alike to  advise on and advocate for the best possible protection  of internally displaced persons (IDPs), and in all my  field missions I pay specific attention to the protection  of internally displaced <VIC>women and girls</VIC>. This year  alone, I have carried out missions to <HER>Kenya</HER>, <HER>Azerbaijan</HER>, <HER>Cote d'Ivoire</HER>, <HER>Haiti</HER> and <HER>Ukraine</HER>. Such field missions  are significant in that they provide an early warning  system for the international community through the  <HER>Human Rights Council</HER>, the <HER>General Assembly</HER> and, in  this instance, the <HER>Security Council</HER> itself on the actual  causes, conditions and situations of displacement.    My mandate receives specific support from  <HER>United Nations</HER> agencies and entities, in particular  the <HER>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights</HER>, the <HER>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</HER> and the <HER>Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</HER>, and I am  grateful for their support and great collaboration. My  work could not be possible without the outstanding  support extended by <HER>Member States</HER>, both those  working to cope with and to protect IDPs and those  supporting action to improve the lives of internally  displaced persons internationally. I am grateful for  the ever-growing cooperation extended by <HER>States</HER> to  my mandate. I would also like to highlight the Arria  Formula meeting in May on the protection of IDPs,  co-chaired by <HER>Chile</HER> and <HER>Argentina</HER>, which I had the  privilege to address and during which the issue of  internal displacement and threats to international peace  and security were tackled.    We started 2014 with an unprecedented peak in the  number of persons forcibly displaced within their own  countries due to armed conflict, generalized Violence  or human rights violations - 33.3 million internally  displaced persons, the highest figure ever recorded.  In many countries, IDPs are also displaced by natural  disasters, further compounding existing vulnerabilities.  <VIC>Women and girls</VIC> account for some half of the world's  IDP population.    Since the 1990s, greater attention has been paid to  the rights and needs of <VIC>women and girls</VIC> in emergency  and post-conflict situations and to promoting gender-  sensitive approaches in humanitarian, development  and early recovery response. A wide range of  resolutions - for instance, the landmark resolution  1325 (2000) - but also policies, gender-mainstreaming  efforts and targeted programmes have been adopted in  this regard, and they have increasingly encompassed  internally displaced <VIC>women and girls</VIC>.    The 1998 Guiding Principles on Internal  Displacement, which detail the specific rights of  internally displaced <VIC>women and girls</VIC>, have been  recognized by the <HER>General Assembly</HER> and in <HER>Security Council</HER> resolutions. The Guiding Principles have  informed the inclusion of concrete and progressive  provisions on internally displaced <VIC>women</VIC> in subsequent  instruments, such as the 2006 Pact on Security,  Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region  and the 2009 African Union Kampala Convention for  the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced  Persons in Africa. In 2013, I dedicated my thematic  report to the <HER>Human Rights Council</HER> to the situation  of internally displaced <VIC>women</VIC>, and during this debate  I would like to draw to the attention of the <HER>Security Council</HER> to that report.    Despite such positive developments, responses to  internal displacement still do not adequately address  the specific concerns and roles of <VIC>women and girls</VIC>.  During situations of conflict and violence, <VIC>women and girls</VIC> flee to escape arbitrary killings, rape, torture,  inhumane or degrading treatment or starvation.  They may have been the victims of such violations  themselves or seen their loved ones attacked and  abused. The experience of my mandate is that <VIC>women and girls</VIC> are targeted as a means of armed conflict - to  destroy and humiliate communities, to manipulate the  demographic composition of communities, for sexual  slavery including enforced concubinage, and at times  enforced sterilization. As IDPs, <VIC>women</VIC> experience the  various human rights challenges that are characteristic  to displacement situations and that often place IDPs  at greater risk than other affected populations. Such  challenges include the loss of livelihoods and key  documentation, as well as the lack of effective access  to a number of important rights and services.    In addition, internally displaced <VIC>women</VIC> often  face double discrimination, based on being both  an IDP and a <VIC>woman</VIC>, and experience human rights  challenges due to the intersection of gender with other  factors such as age, group affiliation such as minority  status, disability and civil or socioeconomic situations.  Displaced <VIC>women</VIC> often have to assume new gender  roles that further expose them to gender-based violence,  including physical violence and trafficking. Those  roles include being the only breadwinners and taking  on the increased burden of care for extended families.  Internally displaced <VIC>women</VIC> risk their lives, safety  and physical integrity to protect their husbands and  families. They have told me, \"If we let their husbands  and male children fetch firewood, food or water, they  will be killed, whereas we may be raped but spared  death\".    Other specific protection concerns for internally  displaced <VIC>women</VIC> include inequitable access to  assistance and psychosocial support, education,  training and livelihoods; poor reproductive health care;  and exclusion from decision-making processes. The  fact that more IDPs tend to live in urban rather than  camp or rural settings also raises additional challenges  that have detrimental impacts on <VIC>women and girls</VIC>. I  first visited <HER>Cote d'Ivoire</HER> a year after the end of the  post-electoral violence. Many IDPs had found refuge in  urban areas, including <VIC>girls</VIC> who had been impregnated  during displacement and could not go back to their  communities as a result. However, the inability of  IDPs to continue renting their shelters in those urban  centres, once the cash grant they received to enable  them to stay in urban areas ran out. pushed the most  vulnerable communities, including <VIC>women and girls</VIC>, to  the outskirts of the city. Many displaced <VIC>women and girls</VIC>, particularly those belonging to minorities, are at  risk of statelessness.    Pre-existing patterns of discrimination in many  of those contexts are exacerbated during conflict and  contribute to violations of <VIC>women's</VIC> rights to housing,  land and property. For instance, during my visit to <HER>Sri Lanka</HER>, I was struck by the fact that many IDP <VIC>women</VIC> either lacked proper documentation to their land or had  documents in the name of their deceased husbands or  fathers, preventing them from accessing their land.    To respond to those intricate problems with far-  reaching consequences, we need to look at long-term  solutions. Displacement is not just a humanitarian issue,  but also an issue ofbuilding peace, and constitutes a long-  term development challenge with profound political,  economic, environmental and security implications.  If left unaddressed, protracted displacement generates  further marginalization, inequality, fragility and  vulnerability and erodes <VIC>women's</VIC> resilience.    Displacement can overwhelm the institutional  capacities of affected <HER>States</HER>, which are already dealing  with major conflicts or disasters. Many <HER>States</HER> have  neither policy frameworks or coordination systems in  place to respond to internal displacement, nor a set of  procedures to bring quick assistance to populations  made extremely vulnerable from one day to another as  they have lost livelihoods, social protection and have  gone through traumatic experiences. <HER>States</HER> also lack  comprehensive IDP registration systems by age and  gender.    More needs to be done ifwe are to respond adequately  to the specific protection concerns of IDP <VIC>women</VIC>. Data  collection disaggregated by sex, age, location and other  key indicators is critical for effective advocacy and the  development of programmes to respond to the specific  needs of IDP <VIC>women</VIC> at all stages of displacement,  irrespective of the cause of displacement. National and  international efforts to collect, update, analyse and  disseminate both quantitative and qualitative data on  IDPs, including those outside of camps, displacement-  affected communities and communities at risk of  displacement should be strengthened.    A more preventive approach to sexual and gender-  based violence in the context of internal displacement  is also essential. In that regard, gender-sensitive  training should be provided more systematically to  police and military forces, judiciary personnel and  social workers. A stronger focus on prevention is also  required within the households and communities of  the internally displaced, including engaging <VIC>men and boys</VIC> in those prevention and protection efforts. <HER>States</HER> should take all measures to combat impunity for sexual  and gender-based violence, including by investigating  and holding perpetrators accountable. Efforts to reduce  exposure to sexual violence also entails ensuring that  survivors have access to appropriate support, including  reproductive health care and psychosocial services.    Ensuring access to justice and accountability  mechanisms is key when addressing internal  displacement with a gender lens. In addition to  promoting access to criminal and civil justice systems  for IDP <VIC>women</VIC>, it is also essential to consider how their  concerns can be addressed through transitional justice  measures such as truth and reconciliation commissions  and reparations. Donor accountability for gender-  equality programming for IDPs is essential and entails  more effective integration of gender issues into donor  practices.    I was heartened by the resilience of IDP <VIC>women</VIC>  I met in <HER>Ukraine</HER>. Many of them were volunteering to  help other displaced persons. Meaningful participation  by IDP <VIC>women and girls</VIC> in the development,  implementation, monitoring and evaluation of laws,  policies, programmes and activities that affect their  lives at all stages of displacement is key in the response  to internal displacement. IDP <VIC>women</VIC>, as individuals,  have the right to make free and informed decisions  concerning the resolution of their displacement on the  basis of adequate and appropriately communicated  information, participate fully in building peace and  in planning and management of their return, local  integration or resettlement elsewhere. The participation  and leadership of IDP <VIC>women</VIC> in finding durable  solutions that address their very specific concerns is  critical.    I would like to thank again <HER>Argentina</HER> for the  opportunity to address the <HER>Security Council</HER> today.",
    "UNSC_2017_SPV.8079_spch078.txt": "Mr. Hilale (Morocco) (spoke in French): First of all,  my delegation would like to thank <HER>France</HER> for organizing  this open debate during its presidency of the Security  Council, on an issue that is of the utmost importance to  <HER>Morocco</HER> - <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and peace and security.    The historic adoption of resolution 1325 (2000)  represented international recognition of the role  played by <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peace and security, not only as  <VIC>victims</VIC> but also as agents of change and essential  players in restoring, maintaining and consolidating  peace. Maintaining peace and security requires the  integration of the gender perspective into all peace  efforts, in accordance with the provisions of resolution  1325 (2000) and the other resolutions that followed in  that regard.    <HER_VIC>Women's</HER_VIC> participation in negotiation processes  increases the chances of settling conflicts and  sustaining peace. That finding was confirmed by a <HER>UN-Women</HER>-led global study in 2015, which revealed that  the presence of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peace negotiations promoted  the sustainability of peace agreements, and that 35 per  cent of agreements negotiated by <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> lasted more  than 15 years. That means that the presence of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peace negotiations is a great help for the sustainability  of peace agreements.    On 7 September, 2016, <HER>Morocco</HER> organized an  international conference on the topic of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and  peace and security. It contributed to the international  debate on the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peace processes and  the implementation of national plans of action to  promote collective action on implementing resolution  1325 (2000). It was an occasion to reaffirm the  international community's consensus on the need to  strengthen <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> participation in negotiations and  agreements concerning the settlement of conflicts and  peacebuilding, as well as to renew the <HER>United Nations</HER> commitment to the issue of the inclusion of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and gender equality in all peacebuilding and conflict-  prevention strategies.    During the conference, debates focused on  three areas: the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in mediation and  conflict-prevention processes, the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in  deradicalization and the lessons learned and best  practices in the prevention of sexual violence in  conflict. At the conference, my country announced the  creation in Rabat of an independent regional centre, a  think-tank, dedicated to studying the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in  peacekeeping operations and their contribution to the  achievement of sustainable development. The centre  could serve as a space for reflection, a think-tank and  a source of independent thought regarding the role and  place of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peacekeeping and peacebuilding  operations in conflict zones. It is in keeping with the  priorities of <HER_VIL>the Security Council</HER_VIL> in promoting <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> empowerment and gender equality in the establishment  of peace and international security, the dissemination  of the culture of peace, ensuring access to justice and  the protection of civil rights.    <HER_VIC>Women</HER_VIC> and <HER_VIC>girls</HER_VIC> have special needs in the post-  conflict period, such as health services, livelihood,  land rights and property rights and employment.  They must also participate in decision-making and  the development of national strategies for post-  conflict economic recovery. Unfortunately, <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>  are often underrepresented in the decision-making  process associated with economic recovery and public  governance in the post-conflict phase. They are  not included in formal decision-making structures,  including key economic sectors, such as infrastructure,  extractive industries and commercial agriculture.  To that end, the preparation of an approach based on  gender and development in a post-conflict context is  imperative in order to ensure that, from the beginning  of the reconstruction process, there is sustainable  and equitable development where both <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and  men share resources, opportunities, decision-making  and power.    In that context, <HER>the Kingdom of Morocco</HER> takes  this opportunity to commend the work of <HER>UN-Women</HER>  to promote the implementation of <HER_VIL>the Security Council</HER_VIL> resolutions on <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and peace and security, particularly with regard to economic recovery and  reconstruction through the three areas of intervention:  post-conflict planning, economic recovery and  governance restoration.    <HER>the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</HER>  has placed great emphasis on peace, including the  prevention of conflict and the elimination of its root  causes through Sustainable Development Goal 16,  which seeks to promote peaceful and inclusive societies  for sustainable development, provide access to justice  for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive  institutions at all levels.  The universal 2030 Agenda, which advocates a  cross-cutting incorporation of gender in all Sustainable  Development Goals, emphasizes the need to redouble  efforts to prevent conflict and help countries emerging  from conflict, while ensuring that <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> are involved  in peacekeeping and reconstruction. In that sense,  the Goals demonstrate that gender, peace, security  and development are interconnected, interrelated and  inseparable from one another."
