    "UNSC_2000_SPV.4208_spch004.txt": "Ms. King: I am particularly honoured today, as \n<HER>Special Adviser on Gender Issues</HER>, to have the \nopportunity to speak in this debate, which is so \nhistoric, when for the first time the Council has decided \nto devote an entire open discussion to the topic \n\"<HER_VIC>Women</HER_VIC> and peace and security\".\n\nIt is only fairly recently that the experience of \n<HER_VIC>women and girls</HER_VIC> in armed conflict has been discussed, \nand then discussion has usually concentrated on their \nrole as <VIC>victims</VIC>. Today's debate will show that we have \ncome a long way in a relatively short time. Your \ncountry's strong leadership, Mr. President, in holding \nthe landmark May seminar which marked this year's \ntenth anniversary of the <HER>United Nations Transition \nAssistance Group</HER> resulted in the historic <HER>Windhoek \nDeclaration</HER> and <HER>Namibia Plan of Action</HER> on \n\"Mainstreaming a Gender Perspective in \nMultidimensional Peace Support Operations\". This \nachievement has won universal admiration among all \nthose fighting for <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> right to participate in all \naspects of the peace process. It and your distinguished \nchairing of the <HER>General Assembly's</HER> twenty-third \nspecial session, \"<HER_VIC>Women 2000: gender equality, \ndevelopment and peace for the twenty-first century</HER_VIC>\", \nwhich immediately followed in June, constitute \nimportant steps along the way to considering the \n<HER>United Nations</HER> peace operations from the point of view \nof both <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and <HER>men</HER>.\n\nOther important developments have led to today's \nmeeting. They include the <HER>Council's</HER> decision to take a \nthematic approach to its work; the recognition that the \n<HER>Council</HER> gave - under the chair of <HER>Bangladesh</HER> - on \nInternational <HER_VIC>Women's</HER_VIC> Day, 8 March, to <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> as \nactors in the peace process; the discussion on the \nsituation of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in <VIC>Afghanistan</VIC>, which took place in \nApril, led by the representative of <HER>Canada</HER>; and the \n<HER>Council's</HER> resolution 1314 (2000) of 11 August.\n\nThe timeliness of this discussion is also \nsignificant. The <HER>Secretary-General</HER> has just returned \nfrom an area where he undoubtedly had an opportunity \nto see at first hand the role <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and <HER>men</HER> should \nplay in their societies to bring about peace and to \nrebuild those societies. The discussion also coincides \nwith the consideration of the <HER>Brahimi Panel's</HER> report \n(8/2000/809) on peace operations and its \nimplementation.\n\nThere are three broad areas to be considered in \nthe context of today's discussion: how armed conflict \naffects <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>; how <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> actually respond to \nconflict, the peace process and post-conflict \nreconstruction; and how we plan strategically for a \nfuture in which <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> are equal partners with <HER>men</HER> in \nenhancing our effectiveness in peace operations.\n\nToday I would like to concentrate on the two \nlatter points, drawing on my experience as <HER>Chief of \nMission</HER> in the <HER>United Nations Observer Mission in \nSouth Africa (UNOMSA)</HER>.\n\nWhat do <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> actually do in conflict situations, \nand how do they respond? The <HER>Secretary-General</HER> has \nrepeatedly emphasized the changing nature of war. He \nhas noted that modern warfare is increasingly \nconducted within, rather than between, <HER>States</HER>, and that \nthe <HER>Security Council</HER> is now called on to deal with such \nconflicts. He has stressed that more and more non-<HER>State</HER> \nactors are protagonists in armed conflict; even <VIC>children</VIC> \nbecome involved. The proliferation of small arms and \nthe ease with which they can be acquired, clearly \nshown in the <HER>Department for Disarmament Affairs</HER> and \n<HER>Department of Public Information</HER> video documentary \n\"Armed to the Teeth\", has also added a new dimension.\n\nThe socio-economic fabric of a <HER>country</HER> has now \nto be the major focus of attention. Societal dynamics \nthus become a key guide to finding entry points into \nresolving disputes. <HER>Groups</HER> within each society, and \nespecially <HER_VIC>women's groups</HER_VIC>, non-governmental, \nreligious and other <HER>groups</HER>, have a major role to play. \nWhether these <HER>groups</HER> were formed before the conflict \nor during it is not important. What is important is that \nthey must be part of all stages of the peace \nnegotiations, in planning for the future, in rebuilding \nand in crafting preventive strategies to avoid conflict.\n\nOften, those of us who have seen the value of \n<HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> participation in peace operations at first hand \nare challenged by the sceptics to present empirical \nrather than anecdotal findings. In this connection, I am \npleased to report on the results of a joint three-year \neffort of the <HER>Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO)</HER>, \nmy office and the <HER>Division for the Advancement of Women</HER> of the \n<HER>Department of Economic and Social Affairs</HER>, a study that was \nsupported by the generous funding of several <HER>Member States</HER>. \nThis study, \"Mainstreaming a Gender Perspective in \nMultidimensional Peace Operations\" has just been finalized.\nThe study looks at five peace operations, in \n<HER>Bosnia and Herzegovina</HER>, <HER>Cambodia</HER>, <HER>El Salvador</HER>, \n<HER>Namibia</HER> and <HER>South Africa</HER>. It answers the sceptics by \ngiving objective and empirical findings on what \n<HER_VIC>women staff</HER_VIC> do in missions; whether and how they \ninfluence the outcomes; and how their participating \nequally with <HER>men</HER> can improve the efficiency of <HER>United Nations</HER> \npeacekeeping. The <HER>Windhoek Declaration</HER> and the <HER>Namibia Plan of Action</HER> \nwere informed by these findings.\n\nExactly what does this study tell us? It shows \nunequivocally that when there is a critical mass of \n<HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in a mission - at least 30 per cent - <VIC>local women</VIC> \nare more easily mobilized to join peace committees. \nThis occurred in <HER>South Africa</HER>, <HER>El Salvador</HER> and <HER>Namibia</HER>, \nwhere <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> actively promoted voter education and the \nrights of individual <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> to vote. In other words, \n<HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> participation in <HER>United Nations</HER> missions empowers \n<VIC>local women</VIC> and may inspire them to organize for the \nachievement of a democratic society.\n\n<HER_VIC>Women's</HER_VIC> participation has the capacity to expand \nthe debate a little further so that it may encompass \nmore diverse subjects, including those that may be \nmore relevant to <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and <VIC>children</VIC>. <HER_VIC>Women</HER_VIC> are \nfrequently less hierarchical in dealing with <VIC>local communities</VIC> \nand listen more, thereby having better insights into \nthe root causes of conflict. <VIC>Local women</VIC> are more likely to \nconfide in <HER_VIC>women peacekeepers</HER_VIC> on such matters as rape and \nother sexual violence. The presence of a critical mass \nof <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> appears to foster confidence and trust among \nthe <VIC>local population</VIC>, and this is critical to successful \noperations, such as in <HER>El Salvador</HER>. <HER_VIC>Women</HER_VIC> are active \nnegotiators and able to see more clearly issues that \naffect <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> differently than <HER>men</HER>.\n\n<HER_VIC>Women's</HER_VIC> participation in all aspects of a mission \ncan help to break down stereotypes held by <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in \nmany <VIC>local communities</VIC>, especially where <HER_VIC>women peacekeepers</HER_VIC> \nserve in a broad spectrum of the activities of a \nmission. This has had a spin-off effect on the \nparticipation of <VIC>local women</VIC> in decision-making positions. \n<HER_VIC>Women</HER",
    "UNSC_2005_SPV.5294_spch027.txt": "\u201c<HER>Mr. Wang Guangya (China)</HER> (spoke in Chinese):\nI wish at the outset to thank you, <HER>Mr. President</HER>, for\ninitiating and organizing today's meeting. I thank the\n<HER>Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan</HER>, for his report on\nthe <HER>United Nations</HER> system-wide action plan\n(S/2005/636). Our thanks go also to <HER>Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Guehenno</HER>, <HER>Ms. Rachel Mayanja</HER>, <HER>Ms. Noeleen Heyzer</HER> and other participants for their\npresentations this morning.\n\nIn his report, the <HER>Secretary-General</HER> makes many\nconcrete recommendations for further implementation\nby the <HER>United Nations</HER> system of resolution 1325\n(2000). We welcome his recommendations and express\nthe hope that they can be effectively implemented.\n\nThis year marks both the fifth anniversary of the\nadoption of <HER>Security Council</HER> resolution 1325 (2000)\nand the tenth anniversary of the <HER>Fourth World Conference on Women</HER>, held in <HER>Beijing</HER>. Those\nanniversaries lend particular significance to this open\ndebate on the question of <VIC>women</VIC> and peace and\nsecurity.\n\nFive years ago the <HER>Security Council</HER> adopted\nresolution 1325 (2000), which focused the international\ncommunity's attention on the question of <VIC>women</VIC> and\narmed conflict and which provided guidance for the\nendeavour to promote gender equality, protect <VIC>women's</VIC> rights and expand the role played by <VIC>women</VIC>. In the\nfive years since then - thanks to the efforts of the\n<HER>Secretariat</HER>, the relevant <HER>peacekeeping operations</HER>, the\n<HER>Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women</HER>, the <HER>United Nations Development Fund for Women</HER> and <HER>Member States</HER> - much has been achieved in implementation of\nresolution 1325 (2000). The international community\nnow attaches greater importance to the role of <VIC>women</VIC> in the settlement of armed conflicts, and the\n<HER>Department of Peacekeeping Operations</HER> has mandated\nthat enhanced protection of <VIC>women</VIC> be a very important\ncomponent of the daily work of <HER>peacekeeping operations</HER>. Both at Headquarters and in many\n<HER>peacekeeping operations</HER>, <HER>gender advisers</HER> have been\nappointed.\n\nAt the recent <HER>High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly</HER>, <HER>world leaders</HER> once again stressed\nthe important role of <VIC>women</VIC> in the prevention and\nresolution of conflicts and in peacebuilding and\nreaffirmed their commitment to the full and effective\nimplementation of resolution 1325 (2000).\n\nFive years on, when we look back on the road we\nhave travelled and forward to the path ahead, we can\nsee that a great deal of work remains to be done in\nattaining the goals defined in resolution 1325 (2000).\n\nFirst, we must strive to eliminate the root causes\nof armed conflict and strengthen our conflict\nprevention and early warning systems in order to create\nan environment favourable to protecting <VIC>women</VIC> from\nthe harm that is caused by war. In other words, we\nmust cure the disease by addressing its root causes.\n\nSecondly, crimes of sexual assault must be\npunished more harshly; violence against <VIC>women</VIC> must\nbe more seriously investigated and its perpetrators\nmust be brought to justice. <HER>United Nations peacekeeping operations</HER> must continue to pursue a\nzero-tolerance policy to ensure strict compliance with\nrules and adherence to standards.\n\nThirdly, <VIC>women</VIC> should be encouraged to\nparticipate in peace processes at all stages. In\nparticular, it is essential to ensure that they have\ndecision-making power so that the special needs and\nthe role of <VIC>women</VIC> will be reflected in conflict and\npost-conflict processes. <VIC>women</VIC> are both the primary\n<VIC>victims</VIC> of armed conflicts of all kinds and\nindispensable participants in the resolution of any\nconflict. Their ardent yearning for peace enables them\nto play a more important role in the promotion of peace\nprocesses.\n\nFourthly, a summary should be prepared of\nsuccessful experiences in protecting <VIC>women's</VIC> rights,\nwith a view to sharing and actively replicating them.\nEfforts should be made to enhance awareness of the\nneed to protect <VIC>women's</VIC> rights and to ensure that\nwords are translated into deeds.\n\nFifthly, work carried out on this issue by the\nrelevant bodies should be effectively coordinated. All\nparties should be encouraged to take steps with the\nstrength born of collective action and to make every\neffort to achieve the best possible outcome. Organs\nsuch as the <HER>General Assembly</HER> and the <HER>Economic and Social Council</HER> have been considering <VIC>women's</VIC> issues\nfor many years and have rich experience to offer. The\n<HER>Security Council</HER> should coordinate its activities with\ntheirs.\n\n<VIC>women</VIC> have played an important - indeed,\nirreplaceable - role in the formation of human\ncivilization and the promotion of social development.\nProgress for <VIC>women</VIC> is progress for all of humankind.\nA popular Chinese saying has it that <VIC>women</VIC> hold up\nhalf of the sky. We hope that, through our common\nefforts, <VIC>mothers, wives and daughters</VIC> will no longer\nshed their tears at the horrors of war and that all our\n<VIC>sisters</VIC> worldwide will lead happy and peaceful lives.\nWe believe that our world will then be a brighter and\nmore beautiful place.",
    "UNSC_2010_SPV.6411_spch053.txt": "\u201c<HER>Mr. Zidar (Slovenia)</HER>: I would like to thank <HER>Uganda</HER> for the initiative to convene this important open debate on <VIC>women</VIC>, peace and security. I also thank the <HER>Secretary-General</HER>, <HER>Under-Secretary-General for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> Bachelet</HER> and other distinguished guests for their presentations today.\n\n<HER>Slovenia</HER> fully aligns itself with the statements to be delivered by the representative of the <HER>European Union</HER> and by the representative of <HER>Costa Rica</HER> on behalf of the <HER>Human Security Network</HER>.\n\n<HER>Resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> on <VIC>women</VIC>, peace and security acknowledged that <VIC>women</VIC> are not just <VIC>victims</VIC> of armed conflict and that their equal and full participation is of vital importance in conflict prevention, peacekeeping, conflict resolution, peacebuilding and post-conflict recovery.\n\nIn the past 10 years, many activities have been carried out to strengthen the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> during and after conflict. However, this anniversary reminds us that despite those efforts, much needs to be done in the protection of <VIC>women</VIC> and in the promotion of the participation of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> at the decision-making level, in conflict resolution and in peace processes.\n\n<VIC_VIL>Violence against <VIC>women</VIC></VIC_VIL>, especially sexual and gender-based <VIC_VIL>violence</VIC_VIL>, persists in conflicts. Recent events in the <VIC><HER_VIC>Democratic Republic of the Congo</HER_VIC></VIC> have shown that <VIC>women</VIC> continue to be deliberate targets of injustice and sexual <VIC_VIL>violence</VIC_VIL> in the conflict and its aftermath.\nIn his report (S/2010/498), the <HER>Secretary-General</HER> takes up <HER>United Nations</HER> activities in the implementation of <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>. The report shows that a vast range of activities has been carried out in the past 10 years. However, the fragmentation of those activities demonstrates the need to streamline and coordinate the action of all members of the international community. <HER>Slovenia</HER> supports the <HER>Secretary-General's</HER> recommendation to develop a single comprehensive framework that consists of an agreed set of goals, targets and indicators to guide the implementation of the <HER>resolution</HER> in its second decade.\n\nWe are of the opinion that the issue of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>, peace and security needs to be addressed in a holistic and comprehensive manner. We welcome the <HER>Security Council's</HER> decision to take forward the set of indicators developed by the <HER>Secretary-General</HER> to track the implementation of <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> in situations of armed conflict as well as post-conflict and other situations. We hope that the indicators will now become operational.\n\n<HER>Slovenia</HER> also supports the recommendation to establish a dedicated working group to review progress in the implementation of <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> and to make recommendations to the <HER>Security Council</HER> on how to address gaps and challenges to accelerate progress in the implementation of the <HER>resolution</HER>.\n\nStronger steps should be taken to address accountability and to end impunity for perpetrators of <VIC_VIL>violations</VIC_VIL>. The <HER>Security Council</HER> should impose targeted and graduated measures against all <VIL>parties</VIL> to a conflict responsible for grave <VIC_VIL>violations</VIC_VIL> of <VIC>women's</VIC> rights, including sexual <VIC_VIL>violence</VIC_VIL>. Sexual <VIC_VIL>violence</VIC_VIL> should be a priority element in all <HER>Council</HER> resolutions mandating the sanctions committees.\n\nWe all have a responsibility to implement <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>. The development of national action plans is a key means by which <HER>Member States</HER> commit themselves to fulfilling that responsibility. I would like to report that <HER>Slovenia</HER> is about to finalize and adopt such an action plan. The goal is to interconnect existing national and international activities addressing a broader concept of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>, peace and security in order to translate them into genuine political commitments, and thus accelerate the implementation of <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> and contribute to the empowerment and protection of <VIC>women</VIC>.\n\nIn <HER>Slovenia</HER>, gender equality is a priority not only in the field of human rights and development cooperation but also in security and defence policy. Since 2008, much has been done to promote gender equality in the security and defence sector. Those activities range from awareness-raising and training to the adoption and modification of legislation and other measures, including codes of conduct. The recently adopted strategy on the participation of the <HER>Republic of Slovenia</HER> in international operations and missions promotes equal opportunities with regard to such efforts at all levels, irrespective of gender.\n\nLastly, let me take this opportunity to encourage the <HER>Security Council</HER> to continue to address the issue of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>, peace and security and to seek the most effective means to improve the situation of <VIC>women</VIC> in armed conflict. With a comprehensive <HER>United Nations</HER> approach and increased ownership by <HER>Member States</HER> over their activities, the plight of <VIC>women</VIC> in situations of armed conflict and its aftermath can be eliminated.",
    "UNSC_2014_SPV.7289_spch006.txt": "\u201c<HER>Mr. Beyani</HER>: I would like to thank the Permanent Mission of <HER>Argentina</HER> and the other members of the <HER>Security Council</HER> for holding this open debate on the critical issue of <VIC>displaced women and girls</VIC> in the framework of the <HER>women and peace and security</HER> agenda. The intersection of peace and security, human rights and development is critical to dealing with the issue of internal displacement. We must not lose sight of the important role that <HER_VIC>internally displaced women</HER_VIC> can play in negotiating peace, ensuring their human rights and bringing about development in post-conflict situations.\n\nAs part of my mandate, I enter into dialogue with <HER>Governments</HER> and the <HER>international community</HER> alike to advise on and advocate for the best possible protection of <VIC>internally displaced persons (IDPs)</VIC>, and in all my field missions I pay specific attention to the protection of <HER_VIC>internally displaced women and girls</HER_VIC>. This year alone, I have carried out missions to <HER>Kenya</HER>, <HER>Azerbaijan</HER>, <HER>Cote d'Ivoire</HER>, <HER>Haiti</HER> and <HER>Ukraine</HER>. Such field missions are significant in that they provide an early warning system for the <HER>international community</HER> through the <HER>Human Rights Council</HER>, the <HER>General Assembly</HER> and, in this instance, the <HER>Security Council</HER> itself on the actual causes, conditions and situations of displacement.\n\nMy mandate receives specific support from <HER>United Nations agencies and entities</HER>, in particular the <HER>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights</HER>, the <HER>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</HER> and the <HER>Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</HER>, and I am grateful for their support and great collaboration. My work could not be possible without the outstanding support extended by <HER>Member States</HER>, both those working to cope with and to protect <VIC>IDPs</VIC> and those supporting action to improve the lives of <VIC>internally displaced persons</VIC> internationally. I am grateful for the ever-growing cooperation extended by <HER>States</HER> to my mandate. I would also like to highlight the <HER>Arria Formula meeting</HER> in May on the protection of <VIC>IDPs</VIC>, co-chaired by <HER>Chile</HER> and <HER>Argentina</HER>, which I had the privilege to address and during which the issue of internal displacement and threats to international peace and security were tackled.\n\nWe started 2014 with an unprecedented peak in the number of persons forcibly displaced within their own countries due to armed conflict, generalized violence or human rights violations - 33.3 million <VIC>internally displaced persons</VIC>, the highest figure ever recorded. In many countries, <VIC>IDPs</VIC> are also displaced by natural disasters, further compounding existing vulnerabilities. <HER_VIC>Women and girls</HER_VIC> account for some half of the world's <VIC>IDP population</VIC>.\n\nSince the 1990s, greater attention has been paid to the rights and needs of <HER_VIC>women and girls</HER_VIC> in emergency and post-conflict situations and to promoting gender-sensitive approaches in humanitarian, development and early recovery response. A wide range of resolutions - for instance, the landmark <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> - but also policies, gender-mainstreaming efforts and targeted programmes have been adopted in this regard, and they have increasingly encompassed <HER_VIC>internally displaced women and girls</HER_VIC>.\n\nThe 1998 <HER>Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement</HER>, which detail the specific rights of <HER_VIC>internally displaced women and girls</HER_VIC>, have been recognized by the <HER>General Assembly</HER> and in <HER>Security Council</HER> resolutions. The <HER>Guiding Principles</HER> have informed the inclusion of concrete and progressive provisions on <HER_VIC>internally displaced women</HER_VIC> in subsequent instruments, such as the 2006 <HER>Pact on Security, Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region</HER> and the 2009 <HER>African Union Kampala Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa</HER>. In 2013, I dedicated my thematic report to the <HER>Human Rights Council</HER> to the situation of <HER_VIC>internally displaced women</HER_VIC>, and during this debate I would like to draw to the attention of the <HER>Security Council</HER> to that report.\n\nDespite such positive developments, responses to internal displacement still do not adequately address the specific concerns and roles of <HER_VIC>women and girls</HER_VIC>. During situations of conflict and violence, <HER_VIC>women and girls</HER_VIC> flee to escape arbitrary killings, rape, torture, inhumane or degrading treatment or starvation. They may have been the victims of such violations themselves or seen their loved ones attacked and abused. The experience of my mandate is that <HER_VIC>women and girls</HER_VIC> are targeted as a means of armed conflict - to destroy and humiliate communities, to manipulate the demographic composition of communities, for sexual slavery including enforced concubinage, and at times enforced sterilization. As <VIC>IDPs</VIC>, <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> experience the various human rights challenges that are characteristic to displacement situations and that often place <VIC>IDPs</VIC> at greater risk than other affected populations. Such challenges include the loss of livelihoods and key documentation, as well as the lack of effective access to a number of important rights and services.\n\nIn addition, <HER_VIC>internally displaced women</HER_VIC> often face double discrimination, based on being both an <VIC>IDP</VIC> and a <HER_VIC>woman</HER_VIC>, and experience human rights challenges due to the intersection of gender with other factors such as age, group affiliation such as minority status, disability and civil or socioeconomic situations. Displaced <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> often have to assume new gender roles that further expose them to gender-based violence, including physical violence and trafficking. Those roles include being the only breadwinners and taking on the increased burden of care for extended families. <HER_VIC>Internally displaced women</HER_VIC> risk their lives, safety and physical integrity to protect their husbands and families. They have told me, \"If we let their husbands and male children fetch firewood, food or water, they will be killed, whereas we may be raped but spared death\".\n\nOther specific protection concerns for <HER_VIC>internally displaced women</HER_VIC> include inequitable access to assistance and psychosocial support, education, training and livelihoods; poor reproductive health care; and exclusion from decision-making processes. The fact that more <VIC>IDPs</VIC> tend to live in urban rather than camp or rural settings also raises additional challenges that have detrimental impacts on <HER_VIC>women and girls</HER_VIC>. I first visited <HER>Cote d'Ivoire</HER> a year after the end of the post-electoral violence. Many <VIC>IDPs</VIC> had found refuge in urban areas, including <HER_VIC>girls</HER_VIC> who had been impregnated during displacement and could not go back to their communities as a result. However, the inability of <VIC>IDPs</VIC> to continue renting their shelters in those urban centres, once the cash grant they received to enable them to stay in urban areas ran out, pushed the most vulnerable communities, including <HER_VIC>women and girls</HER_VIC>, to the outskirts of the city. Many <HER_VIC>displaced women and girls</HER_VIC>, particularly those belonging to <HER>minorities</HER>, are at risk of statelessness.\n\nPre-existing patterns of discrimination in many of those contexts are exacerbated during conflict and contribute to violations of <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> rights to housing, land and property. For instance, during my visit to <HER>Sri Lanka</HER>, I was struck by the fact that many <HER_VIC>IDP women</HER_VIC> either lacked proper documentation to their land or had documents in the name of their deceased husbands or fathers, preventing them from accessing their land.\n\nTo respond to those intricate problems with far-reaching consequences, we need to look at long-term solutions. Displacement is not just a humanitarian issue, but also an issue of building peace, and constitutes a long-term development challenge with profound political, economic, environmental and security implications. If left unaddressed, protracted displacement generates further marginalization, inequality, fragility and vulnerability and erodes <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> resilience.\n\nDisplacement can overwhelm the institutional capacities of affected <HER>States</HER>, which are already dealing with major conflicts or disasters. Many <HER>States</HER> have neither policy frameworks or coordination systems in place to respond to internal displacement, nor a set of procedures to bring quick assistance to populations made extremely vulnerable from one day to another as they have lost livelihoods, social protection and have gone through traumatic experiences. <HER>States</HER> also lack comprehensive <VIC>IDP</VIC> registration systems by age and gender.\n\nMore needs to be done if we are to respond adequately to",
    "UNSC_2017_SPV.8079_spch078.txt": "\u201c<HER>Mr. Hilale (Morocco)</HER> (spoke in French): First of all, \nmy <HER>delegation</HER> would like to thank <HER>France</HER> for organizing \nthis open debate during its presidency of the <HER>Security Council</HER>, on an issue that is of the utmost importance to \n<HER>Morocco</HER> - <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and peace and security.\n\nThe historic adoption of <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> \nrepresented international recognition of the role \nplayed by <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peace and security, not only as \n<VIC>victims</VIC> but also as agents of change and essential \nplayers in restoring, maintaining and consolidating \npeace. Maintaining peace and security requires the \nintegration of the gender perspective into all peace \nefforts, in accordance with the provisions of <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> and the other <HER>resolutions</HER> that followed in \nthat regard.\n\n<HER_VIC>Women's</HER_VIC> participation in negotiation processes \nincreases the chances of settling conflicts and \nsustaining peace. That finding was confirmed by a <HER>UN</HER>-<HER>Women</HER>-led global study in 2015, which revealed that \nthe presence of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peace negotiations promoted \nthe sustainability of peace agreements, and that 35 per \ncent of agreements negotiated by <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> lasted more \nthan 15 years. That means that the presence of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in \npeace negotiations is a great help for the sustainability \nof peace agreements.\n\nOn 7 September, 2016, <HER>Morocco</HER> organized an \ninternational conference on the topic of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and \npeace and security. It contributed to the international \ndebate on the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peace processes and \nthe implementation of national plans of action to \npromote collective action on implementing <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>. It was an occasion to reaffirm the \ninternational community's consensus on the need to \nstrengthen <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> participation in negotiations and \nagreements concerning the settlement of conflicts and \npeacebuilding, as well as to renew the <HER>United Nations</HER> commitment to the issue of the inclusion of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> \nand gender equality in all peacebuilding and conflict-\nprevention strategies.\n\nDuring the conference, debates focused on \nthree areas: the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in mediation and \nconflict-prevention processes, the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in \nderadicalization and the lessons learned and best \npractices in the prevention of sexual violence in \nconflict. At the conference, my <HER>country</HER> announced the \ncreation in <HER>Rabat</HER> of an independent regional centre, a \nthink-tank, dedicated to studying the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in \npeacekeeping operations and their contribution to the \nachievement of sustainable development. The centre \ncould serve as a space for reflection, a think-tank and \na source of independent thought regarding the role and \nplace of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peacekeeping and peacebuilding \noperations in conflict zones. It is in keeping with the \npriorities of the <HER>Security Council</HER> in promoting <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> empowerment and gender equality in the establishment \nof peace and international security, the dissemination \nof the culture of peace, ensuring access to justice and \nthe protection of civil rights.\n\n<HER_VIC>Women</HER_VIC> and <HER_VIC>girls</HER_VIC> have special needs in the post-\nconflict period, such as health services, livelihood, \nland rights and property rights and employment. \nThey must also participate in decision-making and \nthe development of national strategies for post-\nconflict economic recovery. Unfortunately, <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> \nare often underrepresented in the decision-making \nprocess associated with economic recovery and public \ngovernance in the post-conflict phase. They are \nnot included in formal decision-making structures, \nincluding key economic sectors, such as infrastructure, \nextractive industries and commercial agriculture. \nTo that end, the preparation of an approach based on \ngender and development in a post-conflict context is \nimperative in order to ensure that, from the beginning \nof the reconstruction process, there is sustainable \nand equitable development where both <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and \nmen share resources, opportunities, decision-making \nand power.\n\nIn that context, the <HER>Kingdom of Morocco</HER> takes \nthis opportunity to commend the work of <HER>UN-Women</HER> \nto promote the implementation of the <HER>Security Council</HER> resolutions on <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and peace and security, \nparticularly with regard to economic recovery and \nreconstruction through the three areas of intervention: \npost-conflict planning, economic recovery and \ngovernance restoration.\n\nThe <HER>2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</HER> \nhas placed great emphasis on peace, including the \nprevention of conflict and the elimination of its root \ncauses through <HER>Sustainable Development Goal 16</HER>, which seeks to promote peaceful and inclusive societies \nfor sustainable development, provide access to justice \nfor all and build effective, accountable and inclusive \ninstitutions at all levels.\nThe universal <HER>2030 Agenda</HER>, which advocates a \ncross-cutting incorporation of gender in all <HER>Sustainable Development Goals</HER>, emphasizes the need to redouble \nefforts to prevent conflict and help countries emerging \nfrom conflict, while ensuring that <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> are involved \nin peacekeeping and reconstruction. In that sense, \nthe <HER>Goals</HER> demonstrate that gender, peace, security \nand development are interconnected, interrelated and \ninseparable from one another."
