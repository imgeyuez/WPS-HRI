    "UNSC_2000_SPV.4208_spch004.txt": "<HER>Ms. King</HER>: I am particularly honoured today, as Special Adviser on Gender Issues, to have the opportunity to speak in this debate, which is so historic, when for the first time the Council has decided to devote an entire open discussion to the topic \"Women and peace and security\".\n\nIt is only fairly recently that the experience of <VIC>women</VIC> and girls in armed conflict has been discussed, and then discussion has usually concentrated on their role as <VIC>victims</VIC>.\n\nToday's debate will show that we have come a long way in a relatively short time.\n\nYour <HER>country's</HER> strong leadership, Mr. President, in holding the landmark May seminar which marked this year's tenth anniversary of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group resulted in the historic Windhoek Declaration and Namibia Plan of Action on \"Mainstreaming a Gender Perspective in Multidimensional Peace Support Operations\".\n\nThis achievement has won universal admiration among all those fighting for <VIC>women's</VIC> right to participate in all aspects of the peace process.\n\nThe <HER>Council</HER> has taken a number of important steps, including its decision to take a thematic approach to its work, the recognition given to <VIC>women</VIC> as actors in the peace process on International Women's Day, 8 March, under the chairmanship of <HER>Bangladesh</HER>, and the discussion on the situation of <VIC>women</VIC> in Afghanistan, led by the representative of <HER>Canada</HER>.\n\nThe timeliness of this discussion is also significant.\n\nThe <HER>Secretary-General</HER> has just returned from an area where he undoubtedly had an opportunity to see at first hand the role <VIC>women</VIC> and men should play in their societies to bring about peace and to rebuild those societies.\n\nThe discussion also coincides with the consideration of the <HER>Brahimi Panel's</HER> report on peace operations and its implementation.\n\nThere are three broad areas to be considered in the context of today's discussion: how armed conflict affects <VIC>women</VIC>; how <VIC>women</VIC> actually respond to conflict, the peace process and post-conflict reconstruction; and how we plan strategically for a future in which <VIC>women</VIC> are equal partners with men in enhancing our effectiveness in peace operations.\n\nToday I would like to concentrate on the two latter points, drawing on my experience as Chief of Mission in the United Nations Observer Mission in South Africa (UNOMSA).\n\nWhat do <VIC>women</VIC> actually do in conflict situations, and how do they respond?\n\nThe <HER>Secretary-General</HER> has repeatedly emphasized the changing nature of war.\n\nHe has noted that modern warfare is increasingly conducted within, rather than between, States, and that the Security Council is now called upon to deal with such conflicts.\n\nThe proliferation of small arms and the ease with which they can be acquired, clearly shown in the Department for Disarmament Affairs and Department of Public Information video documentary \"Armed to the Teeth\", has also added a new dimension.\n\nThe socio-economic fabric of a country has now to be the major focus of attention.\n\nSocietal dynamics thus become a key guide to finding entry points into resolving disputes.\n\n<HER>Groups</HER> within each society, and especially <VIC>women's</VIC> groups, non-governmental, religious and other groups, have a major role to play.\n\nWhether these groups were formed before the conflict or during it is not important.\n\nWhat is important is that they must be part of all stages of the peace negotiations, in planning for the future, in rebuilding and in crafting preventive strategies to avoid conflict.\n\nOften, those of us who have seen the value of <VIC>women's</VIC> participation in peace operations at first hand are challenged by the sceptics to present empirical rather than anecdotal findings.\n\nIn this connection, I am pleased to report on the results of a joint three-year effort of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), my office and the Division for the Advancement of Women of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, a study that was supported by the generous funding of several Member States.\n\nThis study, \"Mainstreaming a Gender Perspective in Multidimensional Peace Operations\", has just been finalized.\n\nIt looks at five peace operations, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia, El Salvador, Namibia and South Africa.\n\nIt answers the sceptics by giving objective and empirical findings on what <VIC>women</VIC> staff do in missions; whether and how they influence the outcomes; and how their participating equally with men can improve the efficiency of United Nations peacekeeping.\n\nThe Windhoek Declaration and the Namibia Plan of Action were informed by these findings.\n\nExactly what does this study tell us about what local <VIC>women</VIC> do?\n\nIt shows unequivocally that when there is a critical mass of <VIC>women</VIC> in a mission - at least 30 per cent - local <VIC>women</VIC> are more easily mobilized to join peace committees.\n\nThis occurred in South Africa, El Salvador and Namibia, where <VIC>women</VIC> actively promoted voter education and the rights of individual <VIC>women</VIC> to vote.\n\nIn other words, <VIC>women's</VIC> participation in United Nations missions empowers local <VIC>women</VIC> and may inspire them to organize for the achievement of a democratic society.\n\n<VIC>Women</VIC> are frequently less hierarchical in dealing with local communities and listen more, thereby having better insights into the root causes of conflict.\n\nLocal <VIC>women</VIC> are more likely to confide in <HER>women</HER> peacekeepers on such matters as rape and other sexual violence.\n\nThe presence of a critical mass of <VIC>women</VIC> appears to foster confidence and trust among the local population, and this is critical to successful operations, such as in El Salvador.\n\n<VIC>Women</VIC> are active negotiators and able to see more clearly issues that affect <VIC>women</VIC> differently than men.\n\n<VIC>Women's</VIC> participation in all aspects of a mission can help to break down stereotypes held by <VIC>women</VIC> in many local communities, especially where <HER>women</HER> peacekeepers serve in a broad spectrum of the activities of a mission.\n\nThis has had a spin-off effect on the participation of local <VIC>women</VIC> in decision-making positions.\n\n<VIC>Women</VIC> political monitors are just as willing and capable of serving in dangerous or isolated areas as men, and do so just as effectively.\n\nThe Department of Peacekeeping Operations has made strenuous efforts to encourage Member States to send <VIC>women</VIC> on missions, on the basis of equity, as their presence can assist in defusing potentially tense situations.\n\nMuch more should be done in order to encourage <VIC>women</VIC> to enter this service.\n\nWhat do this and other studies tell us about what local <VIC>women</VIC> do?\n\nThere is abundant evidence to show that even when having to flee to safety with their families or protecting them in refugee or displaced persons camps, <VIC>women</VIC> take on a number of peace-building activities.\n\n<VIC>Women</VIC> at the local level are a rich resource waiting to be systematically tapped by the international community.\n\nMany aspects of these informal activities have been encouraged, supported financially and documented by the United Nations and its agencies.\n\nThe exchange of information on these practices has enabled the United Nations system to encourage States engaged in rehabilitation to work in partnership with and sustain <VIC>women's</VIC> groups and civil society engaged in these essential but often unrecognized activities.\n\nCapacity-building for leadership and governance led by UNDP and UNIFEM has greatly facilitated <VIC>women's</VIC> ability to play constructive roles.\n\nThese entities are all members of the Administrative Committee on Coordination's Inter-Agency Committee on Women and Gender Equality, which I chair.\n\nWe have lately formed a Task Force on Women and Peace and Security to strengthen collaboration on this critical issue.\n\nThis brings me to our vision for the future.\n\nThe basic blueprint appears in the Beijing Platform for Action, the Beijing + 5 outcome document, the Windhoek Declaration and the Namibia Plan of Action.\n\nThe planning of any mission must include gender equality aspects.\n\nThe mandate of the mission and the guidelines for special representatives must clearly indicate that gender considerations must be integrated into the mission's goals and the head of mission be accountable.\n\nEach mission should have a plan for incorporating gender issues into all aspects of the mission's work.\n\nThere should be a gender unit, adequately staffed and resourced, to provide the necessary backstopping on the mission site, and one in DPKO for overall oversight.\n\nAll sectors and all stages of the transition or rebuilding process should take gender issues into account.\n\nGreater attention must be paid to ensuring the appointment of <VIC>women</VIC> as special representatives, in accordance with the Brahimi report and the call by <VIC>women</VIC> heads of State and Government of 5 September.\n\nThe Council may wish to ensure that all the reports that it receives on missions contain information and data on the extent to which a gender perspective has been introduced and on the number and level of <VIC>women</VIC> working in the various missions.\n\nWorking with the agencies on the ground, the political and development wings of the mission should organize the mobilization of community groups, especially <VIC>women's</VIC> groups, and expand the pool of skills needed to sustain the peace process.\n\nA roster of such groups could be kept by DPKO, in collaboration with regional bodies and agencies.\n\nThe code of conduct for peacekeepers should be regularly updated and, where there are infringements, there should be a continuation of apprehension and discipline.\n\nShould it be decided to appoint a new Assistant Secretary-General in the",
    "UNSC_2005_SPV.5294_spch027.txt": "<HER>Wang Guangya</HER> ( <HER>China</HER> ) spoke in Chinese : I wish at the outset to thank you, <HER>Mr. President</HER>, for initiating and organizing today's meeting. I thank the <HER>Secretary-General</HER>, <HER>Mr. Kofi Annan</HER>, for his report on the United Nations system-wide action plan ( S/2005/636 ). Our thanks go also to <HER>Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Guehenno</HER>, <HER>Rachel Mayanja</HER>, <HER>Noeleen Heyzer</HER> and other participants for their presentations this morning. In his report, the <HER>Secretary-General</HER> makes many concrete recommendations for further implementation by the United Nations system of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ), which focused the international community's attention on the question of <VIC>women</VIC> and armed conflict and provided guidance for the endeavour to promote gender equality, protect <VIC>women's</VIC> rights and expand the role played by <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>. We welcome his recommendations and express the hope that they can be effectively implemented. This year marks both the fifth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ) and the tenth anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on <VIC>Women</VIC>, held in <HER>Beijing</HER>. Those anniversaries lend particular significance to this open debate on the question of <VIC>women</VIC> and peace and security. Five years ago the <HER>Security Council</HER> adopted resolution 1325 ( 2000 ), which focused the international community's attention on the question of <VIC>women</VIC> and armed conflict and provided guidance for the endeavour to promote gender equality, protect <VIC>women's</VIC> rights and expand the role played by <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>. In the five years since then - thanks to the efforts of the <HER>Secretariat</HER>, the relevant peacekeeping operations, the <HER>Special Adviser</HER> to the <HER>Secretary-General</HER> on Gender Issues and Advancement of <VIC>Women</VIC>, the <HER>United Nations Development Fund</HER> for <VIC>Women</VIC> and <HER>Member States</HER> - much has been achieved in implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ). The international community now attaches greater importance to the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in the settlement of armed conflicts, and the <HER>Department of Peacekeeping Operations</HER> has mandated that enhanced protection of <VIC>women</VIC> be a very important component of the daily work of peacekeeping operations. At the recent High-level Plenary Meeting of the <HER>General Assembly</HER>, world leaders once again stressed the important role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peacebuilding and reaffirmed their commitment to the full and effective implementation of resolution 1325 ( 2000 ). Five years on, when we look back on the road we have travelled and forward to the path ahead, we can see that a great deal of work remains to be done in attaining the goals defined in resolution 1325 ( 2000 ). First, we must strive to eliminate the root causes of armed conflict and strengthen our conflict prevention and early warning systems in order to create an environment favourable to protecting <VIC>women</VIC> from the harm that is caused by war. Secondly, crimes of sexual assault must be punished more harshly; violence against <VIC>women</VIC> must be more seriously investigated and its perpetrators must be brought to justice. Thirdly, <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> should be encouraged to participate in peace processes at all stages. In particular, it is essential to ensure that they have decision-making power so that the special needs and the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> will be reflected in conflict and post-conflict processes. <HER_VIC>Women</HER_VIC> are both the primary <VIC>victims</VIC> of armed conflicts of all kinds and indispensable participants in the resolution of any conflict. Their ardent yearning for peace enables them to play a more important role in the promotion of peace processes. Fourthly, a summary should be prepared of successful experiences in protecting <VIC>women's</VIC> rights, with a view to sharing and actively replicating them. Efforts should be made to enhance awareness of the need to protect <VIC>women's</VIC> rights and to ensure that words are translated into deeds. Fifthly, work carried out on this issue by the relevant bodies should be effectively coordinated. All parties should be encouraged to take steps with the strength born of collective action and to make every effort to achieve the best possible outcome. <HER>Organs</HER> such as the <HER>General Assembly</HER> and the <HER>Economic and Social Council</HER> have been considering <VIC>women's</VIC> issues for many years and have rich experience to offer. <HER_VIC>Women</HER_VIC> have played an important - indeed, irreplaceable - role in the formation of human civilization and the promotion of social development. Progress for <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> is progress for all of humankind. A popular Chinese saying has it that <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> hold up half of the sky. We hope that, through our common efforts, <VIC>mothers</VIC>, <VIC>wives</VIC>, and <VIC>daughters</VIC> will no longer shed their tears at the horrors of war and that all our <VIC>sisters</VIC> worldwide will lead happy and peaceful lives.",
    "UNSC_2010_SPV.6411_spch053.txt": "<HER>Mr. Zidar (Slovenia)</HER>: I would like to thank <HER>Uganda</HER> for the initiative to convene this important open debate on <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>, peace and security. I also thank the <HER>Secretary-General</HER>, <HER>Under-Secretary-General for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women Bachelet</HER> and other distinguished guests for their presentations today. <HER>Slovenia</HER> fully aligns itself with the statements to be delivered by the representative of the <HER>European Union</HER> and by the representative of <HER>Costa Rica</HER> on behalf of the <HER>Human Security Network</HER>. \n\n<HER>Resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> on <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>, peace and security acknowledged that <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> are not just victims of armed conflict and that their equal and full participation is of vital importance in conflict prevention, peacekeeping, conflict resolution, peacebuilding and post-conflict recovery. In the past 10 years, many activities have been carried out to strengthen the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> during and after conflict.\n\nHowever, this anniversary reminds us that despite those efforts, much needs to be done in the protection of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and in the promotion of the participation of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> at the decision-making level, in conflict resolution and in peace processes. <VIL>Violence</VIL> against <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>, especially sexual and gender-based <VIL>violence</VIL>, persists in conflicts.\n\nRecent events in the <HER_VIC>Democratic Republic of the Congo</HER_VIC> have shown that <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> continue to be deliberate targets of injustice and sexual <VIL>violence</VIL> in the conflict and its aftermath. In his report (S/2010/498), the <HER>Secretary-General</HER> takes up <HER>United Nations</HER> activities in the implementation of <HER>Resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>.\n\nThe report shows that a vast range of activities has been carried out in the past 10 years. However, the fragmentation of those activities demonstrates the need to streamline and coordinate the action of all members of the international community. <HER>Slovenia</HER> supports the <HER>Secretary-General's</HER> recommendation to develop a single comprehensive framework that consists of an agreed set of goals, targets and indicators to guide the implementation of the <HER>resolution</HER> in its second decade.\n\nWe are of the opinion that the issue of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>, peace and security needs to be addressed in a holistic and comprehensive manner. We welcome the <HER>Security Council's</HER> decision to take forward the set of indicators developed by the <HER>Secretary-General</HER> to track the implementation of <HER>Resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> in situations of armed conflict as well as post-conflict and other situations. We hope that the indicators will now become operational.\n\n<HER>Slovenia</HER> also supports the recommendation to establish a dedicated working group to review progress in the implementation of <HER>Resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> and to make recommendations to the <HER>Security Council</HER> on how to address gaps and challenges to accelerate progress in the implementation of the <HER>resolution</HER>. Stronger steps should be taken to address accountability and to end impunity for <VIL>perpetrators</VIL> of <VIL>violations</VIL>.\n\nThe <HER>Security Council</HER> should impose targeted and graduated measures against all parties to a conflict responsible for grave <VIL>violations</VIL> of <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> rights, including sexual <VIL>violence</VIL>. We all have a responsibility to implement <HER>Resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>. The development of national action plans is a key means by which <HER>Member States</HER> commit themselves to fulfilling that responsibility.\n\nI would like to report that <HER>Slovenia</HER> is about to finalize and adopt such an action plan. The goal is to interconnect existing national and international activities addressing a broader concept of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>, peace and security in order to translate them into genuine political commitments, and thus accelerate the implementation of <HER>Resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> and contribute to the empowerment and protection of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>.\n\nIn <HER>Slovenia</HER>, gender equality is a priority not only in the field of human rights and development cooperation but also in security and defence policy. Since 2008, much has been done to promote gender equality in the security and defence sector. Those activities range from awareness-raising and training to the adoption and modification of legislation and other measures, including codes of conduct.\n\nLastly, let me take this opportunity to encourage the <HER>Security Council</HER> to continue to address the issue of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC>, peace and security and to seek the most effective means to improve the situation of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in armed conflict.",
    "UNSC_2014_SPV.7289_spch006.txt": "<HER>Mr. Beyani</HER>: I would like to thank the <HER>Permanent Mission of Argentina</HER> and the other <HER>members of the Security Council</HER> for holding this open debate on the critical issue of <VIC>displaced women and girls</VIC> in the framework of the <HER>women, peace, and security agenda</HER>. \n\nWe must not lose sight of the important role that <HER_VIC>internally displaced women</HER_VIC> can play in negotiating peace, ensuring their human rights, and bringing about development in post-conflict situations. \n\nAs part of my mandate, I enter into dialogue with <HER>Governments</HER> and the <HER>international community</HER> alike to advise on and advocate for the best possible protection of <VIC>internally displaced persons (IDPs)</VIC>, and in all my field missions, I pay specific attention to the protection of <VIC>internally displaced women and girls</VIC>.\n\nSuch field missions are significant in that they provide an early warning system for the <HER>international community</HER> through the <HER>Human Rights Council</HER>, the <HER>General Assembly</HER>, and, in this instance, the <HER>Security Council</HER> itself on the actual causes, conditions, and situations of displacement.\n\nMy mandate receives specific support from <HER>United Nations agencies and entities</HER>, in particular, the <HER>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights</HER>, the <HER>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</HER>, and the <HER>Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</HER>, and I am grateful for their support and great collaboration.\n\nMy work could not be possible without the outstanding support extended by <HER>Member States</HER> to my mandate. I am grateful for the ever-growing cooperation extended by <HER>States</HER> to my mandate.\n\nI would also like to highlight the <HER>Arria Formula meeting</HER> in May on the protection of <VIC>IDPs</VIC>, co-chaired by <HER>Chile</HER> and <HER>Argentina</HER>, which I had the privilege to address, and during which the issue of internal displacement and threats to international peace and security were tackled.\n\nWe started 2014 with an unprecedented peak in the number of <VIC>persons forcibly displaced</VIC> within their own countries due to armed conflict, generalized violence, or human rights violations - 33.3 million <VIC>internally displaced persons</VIC>, the highest figure ever recorded.\n\n<HER_VIC>Women and girls</HER_VIC> account for some half of the world's <VIC>IDP population</VIC>.\n\nSince the 1990s, greater attention has been paid to the rights and needs of <VIC>women and girls</VIC> in emergency and post-conflict situations, and to promoting gender-sensitive approaches in humanitarian, development, and early recovery response.\n\nA wide range of resolutions - for instance, the landmark <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> - but also policies, gender-mainstreaming efforts, and targeted programs have been adopted in this regard, and they have increasingly encompassed <VIC>internally displaced women and girls</VIC>.\n\nThe <HER>1998 Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement</HER>, which detail the specific rights of <VIC>internally displaced women and girls</VIC>, have been recognized by the <HER>General Assembly</HER> and in <HER>Security Council resolutions</HER>.\n\nThe <HER>Guiding Principles</HER> have informed the inclusion of concrete and progressive provisions on <VIC>internally displaced women</VIC> in subsequent instruments, such as the <HER>2006 Pact on Security, Stability, and Development in the Great Lakes Region</HER> and the <HER>2009 African Union Kampala Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa</HER>.\n\nIn 2013, I dedicated my thematic report to the <HER>Human Rights Council</HER> to the situation of <VIC>internally displaced women</VIC>, and during this debate, I would like to draw the attention of the <HER>Security Council</HER> to that report.\n\nDespite such positive developments, responses to internal displacement still do not adequately address the specific concerns and roles of <VIC>women and girls</VIC>.\n\nDuring situations of conflict and violence, <VIC>women and girls</VIC> flee to escape arbitrary killings, rape, torture, inhumane or degrading treatment, or starvation.\n\nThey may have been the <VIC>victims</VIC> of such violations themselves or seen their loved ones attacked and abused.\n\nThe experience of my mandate is that <VIC>women and girls</VIC> are targeted as a means of armed conflict - to destroy and humiliate communities, to manipulate the demographic composition of communities, for sexual slavery, including enforced concubinage, and at times enforced sterilization.\n\nAs <VIC>IDPs</VIC>, <VIC>women</VIC> risk their lives, safety, and physical integrity to protect their husbands and families.\n\nThey have told me, \"If we let their husbands and male children fetch firewood, food, or water, they will be killed, whereas we may be raped but spared death.\"\n\nOther specific protection concerns for <VIC>internally displaced women</VIC> include inequitable access to assistance and psychosocial support, education, training, and livelihoods; poor reproductive health care; and exclusion from decision-making processes.\n\nThe fact that more <VIC>IDPs</VIC> tend to live in urban rather than camp or rural settings also raises additional challenges that have detrimental impacts on <VIC>women and girls</VIC>.\n\nI first visited <HER>C\u00f4te d'Ivoire</HER> a year after the end of the post-electoral violence.\n\nMany <VIC>IDPs</VIC> had found refuge in urban areas, including <VIC>girls</VIC> who had been impregnated during displacement and could not go back to their communities as a result.\n\nHowever, the inability of <VIC>IDPs</VIC> to continue renting their shelters in those urban centers, once the cash grant they received to enable them to stay in urban areas ran out, pushed the most vulnerable communities, including <VIC>women and girls</VIC>, to the outskirts of the city.\n\nMany <VIC>displaced women</VIC> and <VIC>girls</VIC>, particularly those belonging to minorities, are at risk of statelessness.\n\nPre-existing patterns of discrimination in many of those contexts are exacerbated during conflict and contribute to violations of <VIC>women's</VIC> rights to housing, land, and property.\n\nFor instance, during my visit to <HER>Sri Lanka</HER>, I was struck by the fact that many <VIC>IDP women</VIC> either lacked proper documentation to their land or had documents in the name of their deceased husbands or fathers, preventing them from accessing their land.\n\nTo respond to those intricate problems with far-reaching consequences, we need to look at long-term solutions.\n\nDisplacement is not just a humanitarian issue, but also an issue of building peace, and constitutes a long-term development challenge with profound political, economic, environmental, and security implications.\n\nIf left unaddressed, protracted displacement generates further marginalization, inequality, fragility, and vulnerability and erodes <VIC>women's</VIC> resilience.\n\nMany <HER>States</HER> have neither policy frameworks nor coordination systems in place to respond to internal displacement, nor a set of procedures to bring quick assistance to populations made extremely vulnerable from one day to another as they have lost livelihoods, social protection, and have gone through traumatic experiences.\n\n<HER>States</HER> also lack comprehensive <VIC>IDP</VIC> registration systems by age and gender.\n\nMore needs to be done if we are to respond adequately to the specific protection concerns of <VIC>IDP women</VIC>.\n\nData collection disaggregated by sex, age, location, and other key indicators is critical for effective advocacy and the development of programs to respond to the specific needs of <VIC>IDP women</VIC> at all stages of displacement, irrespective of the cause of displacement.\n\nNational and international efforts to collect, update, analyze, and disseminate both quantitative and qualitative data on <VIC>IDPs</VIC>, including those outside of camps, displacement-affected communities, and communities at risk of displacement, should be strengthened.\n\nA more preventive approach to sexual and gender-based violence in the context of internal displacement is also essential.\n\nIn that regard, gender-sensitive training should be provided more systematically to <HER>police</HER> and <HER>military forces</HER>, <HER>judiciary personnel</HER>, and <HER>social workers</HER>.\n\nA stronger focus on prevention is also required within the households and communities of the internally displaced, including engaging <HER>men</HER> and <HER>boys</HER> in those prevention and protection efforts.\n\n<HER>States</HER> should take all measures to combat impunity for sexual and gender-based violence, including by investigating and holding perpetrators accountable.\n\nEfforts to reduce exposure to sexual violence also entail ensuring that survivors have access to appropriate support, including reproductive health care and psychosocial services.\n\nEnsuring access to justice and accountability mechanisms is key when addressing internal displacement with a gender lens.\n\nIn addition to promoting access to criminal and civil justice systems for <VIC>IDP women</VIC>, it is also essential to consider how their concerns can be addressed through transitional justice measures, such as truth and reconciliation commissions and reparations.\n\nDonor accountability for gender-equality programming for <VIC>IDPs</VIC> is essential and entails more effective integration of gender issues into donor practices.\n\nI was heartened by the resilience of <VIC>IDP women</VIC> I met in <HER>Ukraine</HER>.\n\nMany of them were volunteering",
    "UNSC_2017_SPV.8079_spch078.txt": "<HER>Mr. Hilale (Morocco)</HER> spoke in French: First of all, my <HER>delegation</HER> would like to thank <HER>France</HER> for organizing this open debate during its presidency of the <HER>Security Council</HER>, on an issue that is of the utmost importance to <HER>Morocco</HER> - <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and peace and security. The historic adoption of <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> represented international recognition of the role played by <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peace and security, not only as <VIC>victims</VIC> but also as agents of change and essential players in restoring, maintaining, and consolidating peace. Maintaining peace and security requires the integration of the gender perspective into all peace efforts, in accordance with the provisions of <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER> and the other resolutions that followed in that regard. <HER_VIC>Women's</HER_VIC> participation in negotiation processes increases the chances of settling conflicts and sustaining peace. That finding was confirmed by a <HER>UN-Women</HER>-led global study in 2015, which revealed that the presence of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peace negotiations promoted the sustainability of peace agreements, and that 35 per cent of agreements negotiated by <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> lasted more than 15 years. On 7 September 2016, <HER>Morocco</HER> organized an international conference on the topic of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and peace and security. It contributed to the international debate on the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peace processes and the implementation of national plans of action to promote collective action on implementing <HER>resolution 1325 (2000)</HER>. It was an occasion to reaffirm the international community's consensus on the need to strengthen <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> participation in negotiations and agreements concerning the settlement of conflicts and peacebuilding, as well as to renew the <HER>United Nations</HER> commitment to the issue of the inclusion of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and gender equality in all peacebuilding and conflict-prevention strategies. During the conference, debates focused on three areas: the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in mediation and conflict-prevention processes, the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in deradicalization, and the lessons learned and best practices in the prevention of sexual violence in conflict. At the conference, my <HER>country</HER> announced the creation in Rabat of an independent regional centre, a think-tank, dedicated to studying the role of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peacekeeping operations and their contribution to the achievement of sustainable development. The centre could serve as a space for reflection, a think-tank, and a source of independent thought regarding the role and place of <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> in peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations in conflict zones. It is in keeping with the priorities of the <HER>Security Council</HER> in promoting <HER_VIC>women's</HER_VIC> empowerment and gender equality in the establishment of peace and international security, the dissemination of the culture of peace, ensuring access to justice and the protection of civil rights. <VIC>Women</VIC> and <VIC>girls</VIC> have special needs in the post-conflict period, such as health services, livelihood, land rights and property rights and employment. They must also participate in decision-making and the development of national strategies for post-conflict economic recovery. Unfortunately, <VIC>women</VIC> are often underrepresented in the decision-making process associated with economic recovery and public governance in the post-conflict phase. They are not included in formal decision-making structures, including key economic sectors, such as infrastructure, extractive industries, and commercial agriculture. To that end, the preparation of an approach based on gender and development in a post-conflict context is imperative in order to ensure that, from the beginning of the reconstruction process, there is sustainable and equitable development where both <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and men share resources, opportunities, decision-making, and power. In that context, the <HER>Kingdom of Morocco</HER> takes this stance for <HER>UN-Women</HER> to promote the implementation of the <HER>Security Council</HER> resolutions on <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> and peace and security, particularly with regard to economic recovery and the reconstruction process and other areas of intervention including conflict prevention, planning, economic recovery, and governance restoration. The <HER>2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</HER> has placed great emphasis on peace, including the prevention of conflict and the elimination of its root causes through <HER>Sustainable Development Goal 16</HER>, which seeks to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels. The universal <HER>2030 Agenda</HER>, which advocates a cross-cutting incorporation of gender in all <HER>Sustainable Development Goals</HER>, emphasizes the need to redouble efforts to prevent conflict and help countries emerging from conflict, while ensuring that <HER_VIC>women</HER_VIC> are involved in peacekeeping and reconstruction."
