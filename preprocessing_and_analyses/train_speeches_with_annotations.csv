UNSC_2000_SPV.4208_spch010.txt,2000,4208,"Ms. Soderberg (United States): The United States warmly welcomes this open debate on women and peace and security. We pay a special tribute to Secretary-General Annan for his remarks and fully concur with his report statement:  ""Equality of rights, opportunities and access to resources between men and women are fundamental requirements"" (A/52/87]/, para. 89)  in building a durable peace.  I want to join Ambassador Durrant in paying a special tribute to you, Mr. President, and to Ambassador Andjaba, for your leadership in bringing about this important meeting. I also want to pay a special warm welcome to Ms. Angela King, Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, and to Ms. Heyzer, Executive Director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women. This invitation this morning is long overdue and I hope that this body will meet the challenge that you have put to us today. It is an historic challenge that you put before us. We warmly welcome that.  I also want to pay a special welcome to our guests in the gallery. I think your participation and support are very important and I think this is the first time I have ever heard applause in this Chamber. So you are enlivening it.  Today's meeting must not only make us more aware of the important role women play in preventing conflict, encouraging reconciliation and helping to rebuild conflict-ridden societies, but it also must spur us to concrete action. We, in the international community, have failed to make maximum use of the contributions of women in our efforts to promote peace and security throughout the world. As Secretary of State Albright pointed out in a recent speech to a group of businesswomen, ""in too many places, women remain an undervalued and underdeveloped human resource.""  We applaud the unwavering efforts of the United Nations and its specialized agencies to confront problems that mostly affect women. The work of these bodies and the international community's moral and financial support for such efforts has changed the lives of many, both young and old. Working together, we have taken steps to promote equality of opportunity, educate women and girls, change the unbalanced inheritance and divorce laws, advance political and economic rights and eradicate traditional practices harmful to women and girls.  Much of our attention has been directed toward protecting women, especially from the devastating effects of armed conflict, including forced displacement, trafficking of women, torture, rape and other acts of sexual violence, as well as a host of other crimes. For example, the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights focused on women solely as victims of armed conflict. While the issue of protection of women cannot be ignored, I hope that Security Council action will emphasize the leadership role women can and should play in restoring peace.  Women are an under-utilized positive force for peace. The Fourth World Conference on Women recognized that they must be fully involved in preventing and resolving conflicts. We must actively promote formal mechanisms, which support a consistent female presence at the peace table, in peacekeeping operations and in the peace building efforts to reconstruct institutions vital to lasting stability.  The Secretary-General, by appointing qualified women to visible positions of influence, has set a laudable example for us all to follow. Deputy Secretary-General Louise Frechette, High Commissioners Mary Robinson and Sadako Ogata, the United Nations Children's Fund's Carol Bellamy and the World Food Programme's Catherine Bertini, to name just a few, demonstrate daily that women do make a difference in defusing conflicts and promoting equality, peace and security. The challenge before us is to emulate their achievements in other international and regional organizations, in national Governments and across all levels of society. The United States applauds the appointment of these women, but we want to see more done.  In particular, we need more women as Special Representatives of the Secretary-General, as special envoys and as human rights investigators and monitors. We hope the Secretary-General will strive to appoint more, fully qualified women to these positions, as well as those within his own Secretariat. We strongly encourage Member States to bring such candidates to his attention and to support the idea of the United Nations maintaining a roster of qualified women maintained as part of the United Nations Standby Arrangements System.  We need more than influential women at the highest levels of power and prestige. The United Nations must ensure that women's voices are heard wherever the United Nations assists in the settlement of conflicts and in post-conflict peace-building. With all due respect to my colleagues, just look around this room. A good place to start would be for Member States to appoint more women as ambassadors to the United Nations. Certainly one woman Permanent Representative, the distinguished Patricia Durrant, out of 15 on the Security Council, is at least 6 or 7 too few. Ten women out of 189 Permanent Representatives is a sad commentary on the state of women in leadership positions of Member States. If we are to heed President Theo-Ben Gurirab's challenge that we all just heard in the video to make women half of every solution, Member States must be able to do better than five per cent.  In all phases of peacekeeping and peace-building missions the presence of women must be visible and consistent. When possible, fact-finding missions should include gender advisors and the terms of reconciliation and reconstruction should draw on the expertise of women's community groups. The immediate aftermath of a conflict provides a unique window of opportunity to rebuild, with the equal participation of women, the public security institutions vital to lasting stability. In order to facilitate this, States should be committed to gender balance in their contributions to civilian police and other peacekeeping contingents and to assisting other States in achieving a gender-balanced perspective.  In place after place, from Northern Ireland to Guatemala to South Africa, we see that women are most effective when they are able to organize and be heard. Our First Lady's involvement in the organization Vital Voices has demonstrated around the world this fact time and again. We, as members of the Security Council, cannot be content with token representation of half of the world's population. The Security Council should consider establishing a very specifically mandated expert panel or working group to report on mechanisms that will ensure equal representation of women in peacekeeping and peace-building operations.  We also need to prepare our United Nations peacekeepers for encounters with the entire population in a mission area. This means that peacekeepers- military, civilian and civil servants - should be trained in gender issues; and it means that they who violate women's most basic rights must be brought to justice. The training should focus on codes of conduct and cultural and societal norms with respect to women, and on the study of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women.  At managerial levels training should include the participation of women in institution-building, particularly in rule-of-law areas. The Training Unit of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations should develop exportable modules that may be used in national and regional programmes, and all United Nations training programmes must include elements on gender issues.  We encourage States to assist in other meaningful ways as well. The United States, for example, has provided funding to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to support the Bosnian Women's Initiative, which promotes the reintegration of women into the economy. It emphasizes training, legal assistance and support for micro-enterprise projects. Likewise, the United States has supported the Rwanda Women's Initiative to address refugee women's reintegration. The Department of State has also provided support for the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children, which operates in Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan and the Sudan. Those programmes not only provide services to women in war-torn areas, but they also seek to integrate them into the political and economic lives of their countries.  As we move forward we should take care that our efforts to further empower women in no way disadvantage men. We should strive for equality, not special treatment. What we really need is a commitment from Member States of the United Nations, the Secretariat and all concerned to honour the obligations and promises already made to women. We should now look ahead to concrete initiatives in support of those promises.  In closing, let me again commend you and your delegation, Mr. President, for calling this important meeting today. I hope this meeting will be the beginning of regular discussions in this Chamber, and that one day there will be equal gender representation around this table and throughout these halls.

UNSC_2000_SPV.4208Resumption1_spch030.txt,2000,4208,"Mr. Mwakawago (United Republic of Tanzania): It gives my delegation particular pleasure to see you, Sir, presiding over this open debate on women and peace and security. My delegation warmly welcomes the convening of this meeting and hopes that the outcome of this historic debate will contribute to a better understanding of the gender dimension of peace processes.  It is significant that in recognition of the importance that your country attaches to this issue, the seminar on ""Mainstreaming a Gender Perspective in Multidimensional Peace Support Operations"" was held in Windhoek from 29 to 31 May 2000. In this regard my delegation supports the Namibia Plan of Action and the call made to the Secretary-General to ensure that appropriate follow-up measures are undertaken to implement it.  This debate on women, peace and security is an important reminder to all of us of the need to resolve conflicts, particularly those in Africa and elsewhere which are of grave concern to all of us. Due to these conflicts, about six million Africans are refugees and over 15 million people are displaced, between 60 and 80 per cent of whom are women and children.  The 2000 Machel review points out, in chapter 5, that:  ""During armed conflict, women and girls are continually threatened by rape, domestic violence, sexual exploitation, trafficking, sexual humiliation and mutilation.""  They are at risk in all settings - be it at home, in flight or in camps. In some cases, systematic rape and terror are used as weapons of war. After having been subjected to such atrocities, they are left with scars that take longer to heal.  There is no denying that it is women who shoulder the responsibility of supporting their families and communities. Women serve alongside their male counterparts in times of war. It is also women who serve at the forefront of peace movements. Under these circumstances, it is evident that we cannot continue excluding women from conflict resolution processes. Expanding the role of women in this area is imperative, not only to address inequities but also to ensure that our societies benefit from their approaches to preventing conflicts, solving conflicts and building peace.  Being direct victims of violence and discrimination, women have gained a great understanding of the need to address peace comprehensively. It is encouraging to note that given the prevalence of conflicts, particularly in Africa today, women have taken some initiatives to promote peaceful resolution of conflicts and to generate a culture of peace. In this context, the role of Burundian women in the peace process in their country - and the recognition of that role by President Nelson Mandela, the Facilitator of the Burundi peace process - should serve as an example and as a source of inspiration to the international community. It is the hope of my delegation that the Council will adopt a resolution that gives due weight to the role that women can play in peace negotiations and accord them due recognition. The international community needs, therefore, to agree on a framework that guarantees women that right.  Both the final outcome document of the twenty- third special session of the General Assembly entitled ""Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century"" and the Millennium Summit Declaration place emphasis on shared responsibility to maintain international peace and security. On the occasion of International Women's Day on 8 March, the then President of the Security Council, Ambassador Chowdhury of Bangladesh, observed in a statement to the Press:  ""Members of the Council note that although women have begun to play an important role in conflict resolution, peacekeeping and peace- building, they are still under-represented in decision-making in regard to conflict. If women are to play an equal part in security and maintaining peace, they must be empowered politically and economically, and represented adequately at all levels of decision-making, both at the pre-conflict stage and during hostilities, as well as at the point of peacekeeping, peace- building, reconciliation and reconstruction.""  In reiterating this position, we call on the international community and Governments to intensify efforts aimed at the realization of the objective set out in that statement, including the enhancement of the role of women in various phases of the transition to peace and post-conflict reconstruction.

UNSC_2000_SPV.4208Resumption2_spch004.txt,2000,4208,"Mr. Juwayeyi (Malawi): Those of us who are not in the Security Council do not get an opportunity to congratulate a delegation for assuming the presidency of the Council, so it gives me particular pleasure this morning to congratulate you, Mr. President, and I am most grateful that during your presidency you have taken the initiative to hold this open session on women and peace and security.  My Government attaches great importance to the protection and security of women and girls, both in situations of armed conflict and in peace. Wars and armed conflict bring untold suffering and misery to communities and nations, for they entail devastating and horrific levels of violence and brutality, employing any possible means. Today's wars and conflicts make little distinction between soldiers and civilians and between adults and children. Currently, most of the wars and conflicts take place in developing countries, where most of the population lives in rural areas. Often, these conflicts are within countries, rather than across borders. Women and children constitute a disproportionate number of the affected populations and, therefore, suffer the brunt of violence and brutality.  Armed conflict affects women and girls differently from men and boys. During armed conflict, not only are women and girls killed, maimed, abducted, separated from their loved ones, subjected to starvation, malnutrition and forced displacement, but they are also continually threatened with rape, domestic violence, sexual exploitation and slavery, trafficking, sexual humiliation and mutilation. Rape and sexual violence perpetrated by the armed forces, whether governmental or other actors, including in some instances peacekeeping personnel, increases the potential for spreading HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. No wonder most of the HIV/AIDS victims in the developing countries are women and girls. HIV/AIDS leaves millions of children orphaned and, in most cases, the responsibility to care for them rests largely on the shoulders of older people.  All of these harmful and widespread threats to women and girls have long-term consequences for durable peace, security and development. The sad thing is that in most instances the women do not know why the wars and armed conflicts erupt, owing to the fact that they are either under-represented or not represented at all at the decision-making levels.  My Government applauds and thanks the Secretary-General, the United Nations bodies and agencies, non-governmental organizations, international agencies and donor countries for the efforts they have made to protect and secure peace and security for women and girls. Various international legal instruments, particularly the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the corresponding Optional Protocols, have been adopted by the General Assembly. International Criminal Tribunals have been established for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda, and these have made great strides to help end impunity for crimes against women and girls. Forms of sexual violence are now included as a war crime in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Beyond its emergency relief responsibilities, the United Nations has increasingly become involved in efforts aimed at peacekeeping, peace-making and peace-building. It is gratifying to note that the Security Council, even though it has taken five decades to do so, has now recognized the importance of women's role and of their increased participation in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peace-building.  However, there is still a lot more that needs to be done. Appropriate solutions cannot be achieved if women are left out of the decision-making machinery. You are aware, Mr. President, that women continue to be under-represented in all peacekeeping, peace- making and peace-building efforts, including in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in the United Nations. This should not be allowed to continue.  In the long term however, the only way to truly ensure the protection and security of women and girls is to prevent wars and armed conflicts from taking place. Major root causes of most of the recent wars and armed conflicts have included poverty and lack of respect for human rights. These ills must be addressed first. My delegation recalls that, at the end of the Millennium Summit, world leaders pledged to eradicate poverty and make the right to development a reality for everyone. This means promoting equality between men and women in decision-making. This further means the involvement and full participation of women in all issues, including peacekeeping, peacemaking and peace-building, as well as at the negotiating table, from the grassroots level to the decision-making levels.  My delegation requests the Secretary-General and the Security Council to urge Member States to ensure that training in human rights and peacekeeping, peacemaking and peace-building includes everyone - civilians, soldiers, the police, civil society, the women themselves and peacekeeping personnel. Those who commit crimes against women, including the peacekeeping personnel, should be brought to book.  Let us heed the women's cry for an equal opportunity to voice their ideas in official peace negotiations. And let us act now.

This further means the involvement and full participation of women in all issues, including peacekeeping, peacemaking and peace-building, as well as at the negotiating table, from the grassroots level to the decision-making levels.  My delegation requests the Secretary-General and the Security Council to urge Member States to ensure that training in human rights and peacekeeping, peacemaking and peace-building includes everyone - civilians, soldiers, the police, civil society, the women themselves and peacekeeping personnel. Those who commit crimes against women, including the peacekeeping personnel, should be brought to book.  Let us heed the women's cry for an equal opportunity to voice their ideas in official peace negotiations. And let us act now.

UNSC_2002_SPV.4589Resumption1_spch011.txt,2002,4589,"Mr. Motomura (Japan): At the outset, I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for your initiative in convening this open meeting as a follow-up to Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), entitled ""Women and peace and security"".  With the adoption of Council resolution 1325 (2000) in October 2000 and the subsequent statement by the President of the Security Council in October last year, the linkage between international peace and security and gender issues has been increasingly recognized throughout the international community. Indeed, there is a growing awareness of the negative impact that armed conflict has on women and children in particular and of the importance of women's participation in post-conflict peace processes.  On the other hand, what is now needed is more detailed information and analysis of concrete examples, as well as recommendations and practical measures. My delegation, therefore, looks forward to the results of the study conducted by Ms. Angela King, Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women. We also look forward to the results of the assessments by the two independent experts appointed by the United Nations Development Fund for Women on the impact of armed conflict on women and the role of women in peace-building, as well as the report of the Secretary-General to be submitted later this year.  The conclusions of these studies and reports will be crucial in terms of giving direction and providing concrete methodologies for the steady implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  Allow me to briefly describe the basic views and concrete actions taken by my Government as regards gender mainstreaming in the area of conflicts and peacekeeping. First, I would like to draw special attention to the active role Afghan women are playing the post-conflict reconstruction of their country. As Prime Minister Koizumi stated at the international conference on reconstruction assistance to Afghanistan, held in Tokyo earlier this year, one of the highest priorities of Japan's assistance for Afghanistan's reconstruction is the empowerment of women.  Japan has thus sent an expert to the Ministry of Women's Affairs and has extended financial support for the establishment of women's centres in Afghanistan. Moreover, in February, Japan set up the Advisory Council on Assistance to Women in Afghanistan, taking into account the proposals of the Security Council, and is determined to continuously support the tremendous efforts the Afghan women themselves are making to restore peace in their country.  Secondly, with the mandates of peacekeeping operations becoming more multidimensional, it is increasingly important that women's views are integrated into their respective activities. I am pleased to note that earlier this year the Japanese Government for the first time dispatched seven women peacekeepers to the United Nations peacekeeping operations in East Timor, where they are now engaged in coordination activities in such areas as communication and translation. In addition, an increasing number of Japanese women who are United Nations staff members are working in the civilian components of peacekeeping missions. The Government of Japan will continuously strive to increase the participation of women in peace operations in various areas.  Thirdly, given the particular importance of gender mainstreaming in the field, the Japanese Government supported the recommendation of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, which was endorsed by the General Assembly, that ""the work of gender focal points should have the proper back-up in the Secretariat"". In this context, my delegation hopes that, as stated in General Assembly resolution 56/293 in June this year, the Secretariat will develop and clearly explain a coherent policy on gender mainstreaming in all United Nations peacekeeping activities.  In October we will celebrate the second anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). My delegation hopes that the entire discussion at today's meeting will prove useful in the ongoing efforts to follow up the resolution and will be fully reflected in the report of the Secretary- General.  In closing, let me assure you, Mr. President, of Japan's readiness to contribute to the goals of this important resolution in cooperation with all other interested Member States.

UNSC_2002_SPV.4589Resumption1_spch015.txt,2002,4589,"Mr. Stanislaus (Grenada): In my 12 years at the United Nations, this is the first time that I avail myself of the opportunity to address this body. Although I have spoken many times in other United Nations forums, I do so today because the item on the Council's agenda - women, peace and security - is near and dear to my heart as I approach my fiftieth wedding anniversary.  I begin with the premise that the family is the basis of society and that good family life is inextricably intertwined with and interwoven into good national life, which by extension can promote good international life. From time immemorial, much of the peace and harmony of the human family, especially in conflict resolution therein, devolves upon the woman of the house in her natural milieu as peacemaker.  Here lies a glorious opportunity to involve women in peacemaking, peace-building and peacekeeping at the highest level, nationally and internationally. The age-old saying that the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world remains only a good adage unless women are brought into the mainstream of decision-making at the highest political, educational, social, economic, cultural and other levels. Then, and only then, will the world give credence and substance to the ancient Chinese proverb that women hold up half the sky.  The Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing in September 1995, drew up the Beijing Declaration and Programme of Action. It contains 12 subject areas, 6 of which are analysed in the United Nations publication entitled ""The World's Women 2000: Trends and Statistics"". This was issued just before the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly in June 2000, entitled ""Women 2000: Gender, Equality, Development and Peace for the Twenty-First Century"". The intent was to show the progress as well as the disparities between women and men worldwide in health, human rights, political decision-making, work, education and families.  Due to time constraints, my delegation will touch briefly on three subject areas, namely, human rights, political decision-making and work. While progress has been made, we cannot fail to see that we are still a long way from attaining the proclaimed goal of women's rights as human rights, as was discussed in the Millennium Report, or of equal rights of men and women affirmed in the Charter, or of everyone, without discrimination, having the right to equal pay for equal work, as emphasized in article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Yet, gender imbalance is nowhere more noticeable than in the workplace, where on average women earn at least 30 per cent less than men for equal work. Moreover, in the home, where a woman's domestic role as spouse and mother is so vital to the well-being of society, her work is always undervalued and underpaid. Unpaid domestic work everywhere is seen as a woman's responsibility.  Is it not incongruous that more than 50 years after the ratification of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that the political landscape is still dominated by men? Yet all international instruments and all national legislatures enshrine the principle of equality between men and women. Men have a responsibility therefore to help remove the patriarchal dominance in society and to allow the private virtues of women to go public. Indeed, men of quality should never feel threatened by women for equality.  Gender equality is predicated upon education of girls and boys so that they can be empowered throughout their life in today's globalizing world to enter the gender mainstream of equal opportunity. The report of the sixth session of the Commission on the Status of Women, published on 25 March 2002, tells how far we are from attaining this goal. Given the opportunity for education, women and girls do as well as men and boys. Some even think that women and girls do better.  In 1916, psychologist George Stratton of the University of Southern California described what he considered - what he considered, remember, not what I consider - the inherent superiority of the female brain in seeing the whole picture. Writing on feminism and psychology in Century Magazine, he expressed the hope that women would dispel masculine illusions when they took their rightful place in society.  Men, he said, tend to fix on cogs instead of flesh and blood. Beginning with a generous wonder at nature, men end up with fascination for the tool, the scientific instrument. They establish governments to give order to life and then end up coveting the functions of government more than life. The masculine genius for organization, Stratton said, needs women's sense of the heart of things, not the trappings.  I cannot end without recalling from Greek mythology the resourcefulness, the common sense and the power of women. In Lysistrata, a masterpiece of comedy written in 411 BC, Aristophanes tells of how, during the silly and unnecessary Peloponnesian war between the city-state of Athens and Sparta, the women ended the military madness and exposed the absurdity and futility of war by seizing, first, the Acropolis, which contained the Treasury, then refusing to have intimate relations with the returning men soldiers. Taken together, their actions of seizure and sex strike brought peace and development in a century very far away and removed from the twenty-first century.  Finally, we men serve as the link between home, where lessons are first taught and learned, and the wider world, where they are applied in pursuit of peace and security. An ancient Chinese philosopher captured the contribution of women to peace and security best when he said:  ""If there is light in the soul, there will be beauty in the person. If there is beauty in the person, there will be harmony in the home. If there is harmony in the home, there will be order in the nation. If there is order in the nation, there will be peace in the world.""  What a beautiful tribute to womanhood. And on this score, I want to greet, salute and thank Ms. Angela King and Ms. Noeleen Heyzer and, of course, Mr. Guehenno, for their presentations today.

UNSC_2003_SPV.4852Resumption1_spch004.txt,2003,4852,"Mr. Dauth (Australia): Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to speak today. It would be remiss of me not to begin, Sir, without acknowledging your personal commitment and energy in carrying this debate forward. We also thank Under-Secretary- General Guehenno and Amy Smythe for their very helpful presentations this morning. At the risk of annoying the interpreters, I shall summarize my prepared remarks to make them even briefer than they were, in the interest of moving things along this afternoon. But I cannot leave out the first paragraph, which notes that this is the third anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) and that we, Australia, are proud to reaffirm our commitment to that resolution.  Resolution 1325 (2000) was the first resolution addressing gender issues to be passed by the Security Council. A great deal has been accomplished since then, but a great deal more needs to be done. Not least, of course, because women and girls remain overwhelmingly the main victims of armed conflict, often victims in the most horrific of ways.  Women continue to be significantly under- represented in peace-building, peacekeeping and post- conflict reconciliation and reconstruction, despite the acknowledgement by resolution 1325 (2000) of their importance in those areas. So much still needs to be done.  We have some very relevant experience in the Pacific region which bears attention at the United Nations and by Member States more generally. In particular, we have built issues of the impact of conflict on women and children into our peace, conflict and development policy, which is now an integral part of our aid policy.  We have had experience, in both the Solomon Islands and Bougainville, of drawing particularly on the contribution which women in both of those conflict areas have been able to make. In particular it is the case in the Solomon Islands and Bougainville that women have made a more than equal contribution toward the achievement of peace.  I am pleased to note that we have a senior Australian policewoman as the current United Nations Police Commissioner in East Timor. Police Commissioner Sandra Peisly is the only woman holding such a position in an operation of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO). We make a concerted effort to include women peacekeepers in our peacekeeping contributions around the world.  We remain committed to the sustainable implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). We commend the first steps that have been taken towards that objective, including through the appointment of a Gender Adviser in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, as others have noted, and the development of gender action plans in the Department for Disarmament Affairs and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. We note also that DPKO is developing a field guide to gender mainstreaming and has issued a gender and peacekeeping training manual. In all of this, Jean-Marie Guehenno deserves commendation for his leadership.  But, as I have already said, much more needs to be done. Without further concrete action, resolution 1325 (2000) will only remain a set of aspirational standards. In that context there are some questions which many others have asked but which, I think, DPKO and the Secretariat more generally need constantly to address. What are the hurdles in achieving the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) in current peacekeeping operations? Has the Secretariat put into place any institutional mechanisms to monitor progress made in the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000)? What efforts are being made to ensure that the recommendations in resolution 1325 (2000) are mainstreamed into the work programmes of all United Nations agencies?  The responsibility for implementing resolution 1325 (2000) rests not only with the Secretariat. Member States - and, in particular, Council members - also have important responsibilities, not least in ensuring that mandates take full account of gender perspectives.

UNSC_2003_SPV.4852Resumption1_spch018.txt,2003,4852,"Mr. Mahiga (United Republic of Tanzania): My delegation is pleased to participate in this open meeting on the third anniversary of the adoption of the historic Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security. I should like to express my delegation's appreciation to Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Guehenno for his opening remarks, which we found to be useful and very helpful in this debate. Similarly, we greatly appreciate the presence of Ms. Amy Smythe, Senior Gender Adviser of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The first-hand information that she has provided about her experiences and about the challenges in the field merits our careful and serious consideration. The demonstrated catalytic role of the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, under the leadership of Ms. Angela King, is also highly appreciated, and we encourage Ms. King to persevere on that path.  The adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) was an acknowledgement of the importance of the role of women in conflict prevention and resolution and in peace-building. It was a further acknowledgement of the fact that women not only are disproportionate victims in conflicts but also assume a variety of roles during and after conflict, including those of civilian combatants, peace activists and participants in reconstruction efforts. It was also an acknowledgement of the need to involve women fully in the maintenance and promotion of peace and security and to make that role concrete and visible.  Resolution 1325 (2000) prescribes a role for all players. Three years after its adoption, it is evident that there is a gap between resolve and reality. It is obvious that, for resolution 1325 (2000) to become a reality, Member States must take action commensurate with operationalizing the provisions of the resolution.  That leads me to pose a few questions. Have we been able to give meaning to the resolution by incorporating gender perspectives into all peacekeeping operations? Have we been able to allocate adequate resources - including human resources- to permit gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping operations? Have we made any provisions for the required training of staff, consistent with the resolution?  At this juncture, it is important for me to acknowledge the appointment of an interim Gender Adviser in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. That is certainly a welcome development, which, my delegation believes, signifies the relevance and importance of resolution 1325 (2000). While we express the hope that the Gender Adviser will champion the incorporation of gender perspectives into peacekeeping operations, it is important to ensure that her Office has the requisite support and cooperation from the United Nations system as well as from Member States. We appreciate the fact that the position of a Senior Gender Adviser is being earmarked for the peacekeeping mission in Liberia. We hope that that will be standard practice in future.  I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to share with the Council efforts that have been made in the regions of East Africa and Southern Africa to give meaning to resolution 1325 (2000). Conflict situations have amply demonstrated women's abilities to take active and leading roles in resolving conflicts. Women in the region are progressively taking a keen interest in issues related to peace and security. Political and military establishments and armed groups are increasingly becoming aware of the role and potential of women in those areas. Women, on their own, are also increasingly becoming a powerful constituency in advancing their role in peace and security issues and have proved to be essential in that area. The involvement of women in the Burundi peace process is a case in point.  In the broader context of gender mainstreaming, we within the Southern African Development Community (SADC), have set for ourselves the goal of reaching a minimum target of 30 per cent representation by women in politics and in decision- making structures by 2005. The overall regional situation indicates that SADC member States are making progress in that regard. At least two member States have provided for representation by women in their respective constitutional amendments. Women's combat experiences and their civilian roles in the liberation movements of many of these countries have proved valuable and have paved the way for the logical involvement of women in post-conflict governance, reconciliation and nation-building.  There is a deliberate, gradual increase in the proportion of representation by women in various structures in most member States. As most member States in the region are expected to hold general elections in 2004 and 2005, it is expected that they will use the opportunities of those forthcoming elections and other measures to advance and achieve the immediate minimum target of 30 per cent. The process of women's empowerment will continue thereafter. The imperative is not to give token attention to women's participation, but to acknowledge the fact that the foundation for durable peace, development, good governance, human rights and justice lies in women playing a full part as equal partners in all peace processes and in the maintenance of peace.  My country, Tanzania, is working closely with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to ensure the security of refugees, including women and girls, as well as to ensure the humanitarian and civilian nature of refugee camps and settlements.  As we in the Great Lakes region prepare for an international conference on peace, security, democracy and development in the Great Lakes region to be held in June 2004, we are gratified to note that women have carved out a niche for themselves as important participants in the preparatory process leading to the conference.  While we take note of the few positive steps towards the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), it should be a matter of concern to all of us that women still make up only a small part of those who participate in peace and security negotiations. They continue to be marginalized in most post-conflict planning. My delegation believes that resolution 1325 (2000) is a powerful instrument in our hands. Our challenge is to put that instrument to work to achieve the results it is intended to accomplish. That can happen only if we harness the political will to allocate the necessary funding, to identify the requisite staffing and to provide the training that is required to make resolution 1325 (2000) a way of our political life. Today's debate is a valuable contribution in sustaining the momentum for change in that direction. The trend towards empowering women has generated its own dynamic, which cannot be ignored or reversed.  ",Mr. Mahiga,United Republic of Tanzania,English,m," My delegation is pleased to participate in this open meeting on the third anniversary of the adoption of the historic Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security. I should like to express my delegation's appreciation to Under-Secretary-General Jean-Marie Guehenno for his opening remarks, which we found to be useful and very helpful in this debate. Similarly, we greatly appreciate the presence of Ms. Amy Smythe, Senior Gender Adviser of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The first-hand information that she has provided about her experiences and about the challenges in the field merits our careful and serious consideration. The demonstrated catalytic role of the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, under the leadership of Ms. Angela King, is also highly appreciated, and we encourage Ms. King to persevere on that path.  The adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) was an acknowledgement of the importance of the role of women in conflict prevention and resolution and in peace-building. It was a further acknowledgement of the fact that women not only are disproportionate victims in conflicts but also assume a variety of roles during and after conflict, including those of civilian combatants, peace activists and participants in reconstruction efforts. It was also an acknowledgement of the need to involve women fully in the maintenance and promotion of peace and security and to make that role concrete and visible.  Resolution 1325 (2000) prescribes a role for all players. Three years after its adoption, it is evident that there is a gap between resolve and reality. It is obvious that, for resolution 1325 (2000) to become a reality, Member States must take action commensurate with operationalizing the provisions of the resolution.  That leads me to pose a few questions. Have we been able to give meaning to the resolution by incorporating gender perspectives into all peacekeeping operations? Have we been able to allocate adequate resources - including human resources- to permit gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping operations? Have we made any provisions for the required training of staff, consistent with the resolution?  At this juncture, it is important for me to acknowledge the appointment of an interim Gender Adviser in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. That is certainly a welcome development, which, my delegation believes, signifies the relevance and importance of resolution 1325 (2000). While we express the hope that the Gender Adviser will champion the incorporation of gender perspectives into peacekeeping operations, it is important to ensure that her Office has the requisite support and cooperation from the United Nations system as well as from Member States. We appreciate the fact that the position of a Senior Gender Adviser is being earmarked for the peacekeeping mission in Liberia. We hope that that will be standard practice in future.  I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to share with the Council efforts that have been made in the regions of East Africa and Southern Africa to give meaning to resolution 1325 (2000). Conflict situations have amply demonstrated women's abilities to take active and leading roles in resolving conflicts. Women in the region are progressively taking a keen interest in issues related to peace and security. Political and military establishments and armed groups are increasingly becoming aware of the role and potential of women in those areas. Women, on their own, are also increasingly becoming a powerful constituency in advancing their role in peace and security issues and have proved to be essential in that area. The involvement of women in the Burundi peace process is a case in point.

The key issue now is implementation. Like those who preceded us, we welcome the decision by the presidency to hold this open debate to mark the resolution's third anniversary. Such debates remain necessary, considering how far we are from full implementation.  By adopting the resolution, the Security Council acknowledged that women have a role to play, whether it concerns conflict prevention, peace negotiations, peacekeeping or reconstruction.  The United Nations involvement in such processes and its promotion of gender equality is a key element to establish peace and security in conflict regions. The Security Council should put the same effort into ensuring the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) as it puts into all its other resolutions. The effectiveness of the United Nations and its international authority ultimately rest on the extent to which it is seen to implement its own decisions.  Iceland has consistently supported gender equality and the advancement of women. Resolution 1325 (2000) is an important element of the United Nations agenda in that field.  The Icelandic Government has, for the past three years, been financing the post of a gender expert at the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) office in Kosovo, where UNIFEM. has been playing an important role in advancing gender equality. The Icelandic Government stresses the importance of hiring both men and women for the Icelandic peacekeeping unit.  We welcome the appointment of an interim Gender Adviser to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. We hope that the permanent position of Senior Gender Adviser will be filled shortly. Staff working directly on gender issues must be included in all peacekeeping operations and afforded effective authority to ensure compliance at all levels. We also encourage the Secretary-General, as a matter of priority, to appoint more women as special representatives and envoys, as called for in resolution 1325 (2000).  Iceland was the tenth State to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The entry-into-force of the Statute and the establishment of the Court represent a major breakthrough for the protection of human rights, including those of women. It recognizes, inter alia, the specific impact of armed conflict on women by criminalizing sexual and gender violence and puts an end to impunity through ensuring effective investigation and prosecution of those crimes by the Court. It also addresses another very important subject that is reflected in resolution 1325 (2000): by being the most gender-balanced bench of all international judicial institutions, the ICC provides an excellent example of how to ensure the increased representation of women at all decision-making levels.

UNSC_2004_SPV.5066Resumption1_spch006.txt,2004,5066,"Ms. Gallardo Hernandez (El Salvador) (spoke in Spanish): Allow me to express my Government's satisfaction about the fact that the Security Council has continued to address this important issue. I would also like to thank you, Mr. President, for your initiative to convene this open debate, on the fourth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2004), on the subject of women and peace and security. This is an exceedingly important subject, as it leads us to take up critical areas of the Beijing Platform for Action dealing with women and armed conflict. It also leads us to address efforts aimed at the maintenance of international peace and security, which is the primary role of the Council.  The Government of El Salvador would like to reiterate its concern about the fact that civilians - and especially women, children and older persons - continue to suffer from the devastating consequences of armed conflict, including as refugees and internally displaced persons. As we all know, that has a grave impact on lasting peace and reconciliation.  The experience of the people of El Salvador with armed conflict during more than a decade enables us today to be able to pass on some lessons learned associated with the subject under discussion. Among those lessons, we wish to point out that women are a basic pillar in maintaining family cohesion, struggling for daily existence, keeping a clear focus on their children's priority needs, passing on values and life experiences and becoming the person who establishes spaces for dialogue and agreement, thereby making her the one who can most accurately identify possible areas of intolerance.  The Government of El Salvador would like to emphasize that it is important and necessary for women to participate comprehensively and on an equal footing in all initiatives designed to maintain and promote peace and security, as well as in United Nations peacekeeping and peace-building efforts. It is therefore essential that we promote and strengthen women's participation in the decision-making processes associated with the prevention and resolution of conflict. Similarly, we believe it essential for women to have access to information channels in order that they may be able to identify potential sources of violence, open up new spaces for dialogue among society and instil the values of tolerance and peace, which are essential if peace is to last.  My delegation would like to point out that, for peace to be genuine, women must be able to benefit from peace dividends. In our opinion, this is one of the most important lessons we have learned, because women are capable of looking beyond their individual interests to focus on priorities that strengthen the family and its surroundings, very often at the expense of their own needs. The Government of El Salvador supports the initiatives designed to incorporate a gender perspective in peacekeeping operations. For this reason, we welcome the decision of the Security Council, set out in resolution 1325 (2000), to give all peacekeeping personnel specialized training in the area of protection, special needs and the human rights of women, children and the elderly in conflict situations.  In this regard, we urge the Security Council to draw on the accumulated experience and specialized expertise in gender issues of the relevant institutions of the United Nations. In particular, we would like to refer here to the United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women, as well as the successful experiences of each and every Member State.  At the same time, we urge the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to broaden the role and contributions of women to United Nations operations, both on the ground and at Headquarters. This would apply in particular to military observers, civilian police and personnel working on the promotion and protection of human rights and humanitarian tasks.  In conclusion, allow me once again to state that the Government of El Salvador is ready to continue supporting all the initiatives and measures taken by the Security Council to promote a gender perspective and the advancement of women. It is also willing to contribute to actions designed to protect and promote the rights of women in conflict situations, giving them scope to participate in the long-term process of reconciliation - the only thing that can guarantee a new form of coexistence within countries.

UNSC_2005_SPV.5294Resumption1_spch036.txt,2005,5294,"Mrs. Mladineo (Croatia): Croatia has aligned itself with the statement made by the representative of the United Kingdom on behalf of the European Union, but I would like to add a few points based on Croatia's specific experience and achievements on the matter.  At the outset, allow me, on behalf of my delegation, to commend the Romanian presidency for organizing this open debate to mark the fifth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security.  Since 2000, the international community has increasingly come to recognize not only how much conflict particularly affects women and girls, but also how often women hold the key to its peaceful resolution. It will be important to examine ways in which the provisions of this important cross-cutting resolution can be better implemented at the regional and national levels.  Croatia welcomes the United Nations system- wide action plan produced by the Secretary-General (see S/2005/636), which aims at highlighting the importance of gender perspectives in conflict prevention and peacekeeping activities. In order to achieve success in the post-war confidence-building process it is essential to include women as active participants in post-conflict reintegration and reconstruction. That has also been borne out by Croatia's experience.  The protection of women in armed conflict and women's fundamental role in conflict prevention and peacebuilding cannot be evaluated without taking into account that women are among those most affected by violence and the economic instability resulting from armed conflict. Yet, when it comes to negotiating peace, post-war reconstruction and reconciliation, women are grossly underrepresented. We should continue to press the main bodies of the United Nations, particularly its funds and programmes, to strengthen the participation of women in their work and to streamline gender issues. Post-conflict transition, recovery and reconstruction cannot be achieved if gender equality and the promotion of women's rights are absent.  Croatia welcomes the increased involvement of women in peacekeeping operations, especially among human rights and humanitarian personnel, military observers and civilian police. In that connection, we strongly encourage the practice of mainstreaming the gender perspective into peacekeeping operations. At the same time, we must increase our efforts to improve the protection of women in armed conflict, parallel to acknowledging and enhancing their contribution to peace processes and to rebuilding their communities.  The Commission for Gender Equality of the Republic of Croatia - an intergovernmental commission entrusted with creating policies and coordinating all activities for the promotion of gender equality - incorporated a chapter on women and armed conflict in the national policy for the promotion of gender equality for the period 2001-2005 and in its implementation programme. Both documents were adopted by the Croatian parliament in December 2001.  Some tangible results have already been achieved in pursuing the goals set out in the national policy. One such result was the inclusion of the study of international humanitarian law and human rights in the  curriculum of the Croatian military academy as an integral part of the military education of the armed forces. Special emphasis is placed on the promotion and protection of women's human rights and the introduction of measures aimed at combating violence against women in war, in armed conflict and during post-conflict transition.  We seek to apply a gender perspective in Croatia's participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations. During 2005, two Croatian women officers have been serving in the peacekeeping missions in India and Pakistan and in Cyprus. Currently, five women officers from the Croatian armed forces are serving within the German contingent of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. Preparations are taking place for a female officer to serve as a military psychologist in the peacekeeping mission in Haiti. In addition, a captain of the Croatian armed forces was the first female officer to take part in the Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan.  Of course, the success of the application of the principles and underlying themes of resolution 1325 (2000) rests with Member States. In that regard, there is more that we all can do to ensure that women can fully and equally participate at all levels of decision- making with regard to conflict-prevention and peacebuilding.

UNSC_2005_SPV.5294Resumption1_spch046.txt,2005,5294,"Mr. Pfanzelter (Austria): Austria fully endorses the statements of the European Union and the Human Security Network. Allow me to elaborate a few points.  In 2000, Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) called for women's equal participation and full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security. Little progress has been made since then. Women remain marginalized in the process of peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction.  At the 2005 world summit a few weeks ago, our heads of States and Governments reaffirmed their commitment to the full and effective implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and to the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.  Austria firmly believes that women must be able to participate fully in peace negotiations, peace agreements and the development of a stable society. Now, the creation of the Peacebuilding Commission provides us with a unique opportunity to ensure the involvement of women in United Nations-led peacebuilding processes. Let us use this opportunity by integrating a gender perspective in both the mandate and the structure of that new United Nations body. That concept is contained in the letter addressed by women foreign ministers - including Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik - to the Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly.  The Peacebuilding Commission should ensure, as part of its mandate, that women and women's groups are represented in peace processes, thus enabling them to play a meaningful role. Concerning the structure of the Peacebuilding Commission, Member States and organizations involved in its work should bear in mind the desirability of gender balance in all meetings of the Peacebuilding Commission. Austria believes that a gender advisor should participate in all meetings of the Peacebuilding Commission in its country-specific configurations in accordance with paragraph 100 of the summit outcome document.  Moreover, special representatives, special envoys and other emissaries involved in peace negotiations should have firm guidelines to enhance women's participation in peace processes and transitional structures. Experience shows that a determined policy on the part of the international community in the immediate post-conflict phase in favour of women's participation, inter alia by ensuring that post-conflict legislation gives them a right to participate, can increase the long-term participation of women in political processes in their countries.  As an example, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is currently taking action to enhance implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), has, with its handbook on monitoring women's participation, already achieved important results regarding the role of women in elections as voters, candidates and officials.  Austria welcomes the United Nations system- wide action plan for the implementation of resolution 1325 (2005) proposed by the Secretary-General in his report. We now have a window of opportunity, with the United Nations reform process. It is up to each of us - Member States and the United Nations - to seize this opportunity and enhance women's participation in conflict prevention, peacemaking, peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction.  ",Mr. Pfanzelter,Austria,English,m," Austria fully endorses the statements of the European Union and the Human Security Network. Allow me to elaborate a few points.  In 2000, Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) called for women's equal participation and full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security. Little progress has been made since then. Women remain marginalized in the process of peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction.  At the 2005 world summit a few weeks ago, our heads of States and Governments reaffirmed their commitment to the full and effective implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and to the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.  Austria firmly believes that women must be able to participate fully in peace negotiations, peace agreements and the development of a stable society. Now, the creation of the Peacebuilding Commission provides us with a unique opportunity to ensure the involvement of women in United Nations-led peacebuilding processes. Let us use this opportunity by integrating a gender perspective in both the mandate and the structure of that new United Nations body. That concept is contained in the letter addressed by women foreign ministers - including Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik - to the Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly.  The Peacebuilding Commission should ensure, as part of its mandate, that women and women's groups are represented in peace processes, thus enabling them to play a meaningful role. Concerning the structure of the Peacebuilding Commission, Member States and organizations involved in its work should bear in mind the desirability of gender balance in all meetings of the Peacebuilding Commission.

Let me begin by expressing gratitude to you, Mr. President, for convening this crucially important meeting on the roles of women in the consolidation of peace. I am also deeply heartened by the Council's continued commitment to the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  The Council has before it the report of the Secretary-General on women, peace and security, prepared in response to the request of the Council contained in its presidential statement S/PRST/2005/52. The report contains a comprehensive and candid assessment of the first eight months of carrying out the System-wide Action Plan for the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), in support of activities and commitments by Governments and civil society. The assessment identifies progress and challenges in the implementation of the Plan and offers measures to redress the shortcomings. The Plan has proved to be a useful tool for strengthened inter-agency coordination.  The consolidation of peace is an opportunity to redress grievances and problems that led to conflict in the first place. It holds the promise of establishing equality in a democratic environment and reforming institutions in ways that enable women to take full advantage of opportunities presented through the restoration of peace. Yet, the past year has demonstrated that our collective efforts to ensure equal participation by women in the consolidation of peace have thus far generally fallen short of what is required. From the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the Sudan, and from Somalia to Timor Leste, women continue to be exposed to violence or to be targeted by parties to a conflict, as well as to be marginalized in formal processes, in particular as regards issues of war and peace.  It is axiomatic that States, in particular those emerging from conflict situations, and their Governments have a vested interest in maintaining peace and security, and hence in bringing about the 06-58727  political reorganization of society and establishing credible institutions that can result in human security for all, in particular for women and girls. However, it is no secret that, even with political will at the top and pressure from women's groups below, many Governments are generally hesitant to challenge pre- conflict societal values and norms that are often deeply patriarchal and wedded to customary practices. To overcome that challenge, the following four conditions should be met.  First, the international community should summon all possible political will in order to meet its commitments to women in the realm of peace and security. Secondly, at the national level, Governments should establish clear accountability systems for the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). Thirdly, the Security Council should provide more effective leadership to monitor progress in the implementation in the field and should encourage States to do more. And finally, States and United Nations entities should allocate sufficient resources and capacities for the national implementation of the resolution.  A frank and constructive discussion on how to meet those and other challenges related to national implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) was held on 23 October. It underlined the critical importance of national implementation as the key to achieving sustainable peace and the equal participation of women in peace processes. Within that framework, the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women last month released ""Securing equality, engendering peace: a guide to policy and planning on women, peace and security"".  The full and effective implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) will require all the will and creativity the international community can muster. We can succeed in achieving sustainable peace if we - Member States, United Nations entities and civil society - put our minds to it and use the tools, resources and knowledge at our disposal to fully empower women. For its part, the United Nations will remain a strong partner for Member States and civil society. I look forward to working with everyone in that quest.

UNSC_2006_SPV.5556Resumption1_spch002.txt,2006,5556,"Mrs. Miturumbwe (spoke in French): I would like to say how pleased I am to be here today to tell the Security Council and the international community in general about the concerns and expectations of the women of Burundi in the context of the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  I would also like to express my gratitude to the United Nations system as a whole for its efforts to help Burundian women throughout the reconciliation process.  Burundi has just emerged from a war that lasted more than 10 years and caused a great deal of harm in both human and material terms. Very recently, in September, the Government and the Forces nationales de liberation-Parti pour la liberation du peuple hutu (FNL-PALIPEHUTU) signed a ceasefire agreement. Burundian men and women have welcomed that step but remain convinced that sustained efforts must 2 continue with a view to overcoming the many challenges of the peacebuilding period.  Burundian women, who have committed themselves to the quest for peace since independence in 1961, continue to work to mobilize and to heighten awareness of the need for better representation throughout the decision-making process so as to ensure that their rights are an integral part of negotiations. The right of succession, which would guarantee women the right to land and thus provide for their economic security, was among the important issues considered during the Arusha process. Despite progress at the national level, we have to admit that our Constitution and the Electoral Code say nothing about the proper level of representation at the grassroots level. In fact, the national gender policy lacks resources to implement the principles of equality at the national level. Burundian women have been active since the peace talks, and the details of those activities can be found in the documents distributed to you. There have been consultations among women at the national level in the context of implementing resolution 1325 (2000), and the recommendations of those consultations can be summed up as follows.  Concerning good governance and democracy, it is important to ensure constant dialogue between the Government, the political parties and the media. In this dialogue, general interest should take precedence over individual interest. For good, transparent and inclusive governance, it is important not only to ensure cooperation and dialogue at all levels, down to the local level, but also to include all social groups, especially women. In this connection, it should be noted that the principle of a 30-per-cent quota is applied only for a limited portion of the population and is not reflected at the grassroots level. Furthermore, this quota should be 50 per cent.  We recommend that the international community continue to lend its support to Burundi, so that the capacity-building programme for good governance, which includes transparency, proper management of public affairs, democracy and respect for human rights, might remain a priority. A joint committee made up of members of organizations from civil society and Government should be set up to ensure follow-up in the management of all national resources, including resources granted by international organizations. The current quota of 30 per cent should, in fact, be raised to 50 per cent and be applied at the local level. Civil 06-58804 society should be considered an active partner in all programmes and processes.  Concerning demobilization, disarmament, reintegration and reinsertion (DDRR), we should note that this process is slowly moving forward. Among the important challenges facing Burundi, we should give special attention to the following: circulation of weapons among the population, which is a source of insecurity and constant tension, particularly for women; victims, namely, ex-combatants and persons who have been repatriated or displaced, primarily women, have not yet received restitution and resort to community conflict and violence; the recently established National Commission for Land and Other Property, which was welcomed by women. Unfortunately, its functioning and the implementation of its recommendations require not only mobilization of substantial resources but also know-how and experience in that field. We firmly hope that the new Peacebuilding Commission, established as part of United Nations reform, will make support for the National Commission Land and Other Property one of its priorities. The lack of programmes to help so-called political prisoners who have been released adds to the problem of insecurity.  Failure of the DDRR programme would compromise achievements we have made towards peace and democracy. We recommend that the international community continue to give its political, technical and financial support to the Government of Burundi, so that disarmament, reintegration and reinsertion might become a reality on the ground. The international community should support civil society in Burundi in its efforts to mobilize and promote awareness among the population about the dangers of possession and circulation of weapons in the community and to promote voluntary disarmament. A similar programme could be carried out at the subregional level.  Since the end of hostilities, poverty has continued to increase in Burundi and is affecting, above all, women, who cannot inherit land from their parents and cannot gain title to their husband's land and property. In addition to dependence, corruption and fraud are exacerbating the status of women. Women have always asked that this be given priority in negotiations.  We recommend that the United Nations not hold women hostage to the political situation in Burundi and 06-58804  that women be enabled to have direct access to financing that allows them to undertake and consolidate the work that they have been doing at the grassroots level. Funds allocated by the Peacebuilding Commission should be used for that work. The Commission should ensure follow-up to the implementation of a corruption and fraud focal point that would ensure equitable distribution of public property. The focal point should also respect gender parity.  As for human rights, it should be emphasized that these challenges refer to basic aspects of human rights, for which we would like to make several recommendations in order to promote respect for those rights. Legislation for gender equality and equity should be adopted and applied. There should be an independent national focal point for women's rights to ensure implementation of commitments made by the Government under national legislation and international treaties ratified by Burundi. There should be an end to impunity through the establishment of machinery for transitional justice to deal with rape and murder. That would require the reform and modernization of the police and legal services, which must be professional in spirit and directly accountable to the people. A trust fund should be established to which Member States would contribute for at least five years to enable women who are victims of sexual violence and other abuses to have recourse to justice. There should be support for organizations helping women, in particular United Nations Development Fund for Women, with material, financial and human resources adequate to reach additional beneficiaries.

UNSC_2007_SPV.5766Resumption1_spch020.txt,2007,5766,"Mr. Kapambwe (Zambia): I have the honour to address the Security Council on behalf of the member States of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) - namely, Angola, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, the United Republic of Tanzania, Zimbabwe and my own country, Zambia.  We would like to thank the Secretary-General, the Special Adviser to the Secretary General on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, the Under- Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, the Ad Interim Executive Director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women and the Coordinator of the NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security for their introductory statements, which were very instructive.  SADC welcomes the opportunity, on the seventh anniversary of the adoption of the landmark resolution 1325 (2000), to participate in this open debate on women, peace and security, focused on achieving coherent and effective implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). As we are all aware, the resolution, among other things, calls for the incorporation of a gender perspective in negotiating  and implementing peace agreements, planning refugee camps and peacekeeping operations, and reconstructing war-torn societies. Today's debate therefore provides us with an opportunity to assess the concrete and specific efforts in the implementation of the resolution at all levels and the role of the Security Council in such efforts.  The adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) by the Security Council and the six subsequent presidential statements on women, peace and security provide a solid framework for action in all areas of the peace process. The importance of women's equal participation and full involvement in all efforts to maintain and promote peace and security cannot be overstated. While some progress has been made in the implementation of the resolution, greater coordinated efforts are required to achieve the goal of full implementation. In that regard, SADC calls on the international community to render sustained support in the development of national action plans, including financial and human resources, that will eventually drive the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  We thank the Secretary-General for his report, contained in document S/2007/567, on women and peace and security. The report reviews and monitors the implementation of the 2005-2007 United Nations System-wide Action Plan and identifies gaps and challenges, including in the areas of funding of gender projects and insufficient institutional capacity for gender mainstreaming. We must address those challenges if we are to obtain the desired results. We welcome the recommendations contained in the report, which we believe will contribute to the acceleration of the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  We would like to commend the Inter-agency Network on Women and Gender Equality, the Inter- Agency Task Force on Women, Peace and Security, and the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women for their commendable work in coming up with a holistic and coherent 2008-2009 United Nations System-wide Action Plan, which will serve as a results-based programme and monitoring and reporting tool. The responsibility of ensuring the full realization of the Plan rests with the international community. The Security Council should hold national Governments accountable for the implementation of the Action Plan.  The high number of victims of violence continues to be a concern for SADC. We are saddened that women continue to bear the brunt of grave violations of human rights, including violence and sexual abuses. We condemn all those parties that perpetuate acts of violence and abuse against women and children. We call for the speedy investigation of all cases of Violence and sexual abuse, especially those committed against women and children. The culture of impunity must be stopped by, among other things, bringing to justice all the perpetrators.  SADC is encouraged by the progress on mainstreaming gender in relevant policies and programmes on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR). It is necessary to recognize the needs of women and girl ex-combatants in the DDR process and to ensure that their concerns are taken on board from the planning stages. We commend the work that has been done by the United Nations Children's Fund in reintegration projects that has led to the release of girls from the armed forces in various countries.  We commend the various United Nations agencies that have undertaken capacity-building efforts, including the development of the training models. We would, however, request that there be synergy and coherence in the various training models produced. We wish to reiterate that awareness of resolution 1325 (2000) needs to be broadened and that capacities at the national level to implement the resolution need to be enhanced. In that endeavour, we wish to underscore the importance of building capacity at the local level and, in particular, the capacity of national and local women's groups on the ground.  Experience has shown that the participation of women in peace processes produces positive results, especially because they, together with children, are the major victims of atrocities committed in conflict. Women need to hold decision-making positions. It is imperative that women be encouraged and supported to run for offices, especially in countries emerging from conflicts. In that regard, we wish to commend the work undertaken by United Nations agencies in facilitating the promotion and effective participation of women in decision-making processes. In conclusion, I wish to state that SADC remains committed to the full and effective implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). We in the international community have an obligation to ensure that the rights of women the world over are protected and that their place in all aspects of the peace process is assured. It is their equal participation and their full involvement that will contribute to the effective maintenance and promotion of sustainable peace and security.

The responsibility of ensuring the full realization of the Plan rests with the international community. The Security Council should hold national Governments accountable for the implementation of the Action Plan.  The high number of victims of violence continues to be a concern for SADC. We are saddened that women continue to bear the brunt of grave violations of human rights, including violence and sexual abuses. We condemn all those parties that perpetuate acts of violence and abuse against women and children. We call for the speedy investigation of all cases of Violence and sexual abuse, especially those committed against women and children. The culture of impunity must be stopped by, among other things, bringing to justice all the perpetrators.  SADC is encouraged by the progress on mainstreaming gender in relevant policies and programmes on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR). It is necessary to recognize the needs of women and girl ex-combatants in the DDR process and to ensure that their concerns are taken on board from the planning stages. We commend the work that has been done by the United Nations Children's Fund in reintegration projects that has led to the release of girls from the armed forces in various countries.  We commend the various United Nations agencies that have undertaken capacity-building efforts, including the development of the training models. We would, however, request that there be synergy and coherence in the various training models produced. We wish to reiterate that awareness of resolution 1325 (2000) needs to be broadened and that capacities at the national level to implement the resolution need to be enhanced. In that endeavour, we wish to underscore the importance of building capacity at the local level and, in particular, the capacity of national and local women's groups on the ground.  Experience has shown that the participation of women in peace processes produces positive results, especially because they, together with children, are the major victims of atrocities committed in conflict. Women need to hold decision-making positions. It is imperative that women be encouraged and supported to run for offices, especially in countries emerging from conflicts. In that regard, we wish to commend the work undertaken by United Nations agencies in facilitating the promotion and effective participation of women in decision-making processes. In conclusion, I wish to state that SADC remains committed to the full and effective implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). We in the international community have an obligation to ensure that the rights of women the world over are protected and that their place in all aspects of the peace process is assured. It is their equal participation and their full involvement that will contribute to the effective maintenance and promotion of sustainable peace and security.

UNSC_2007_SPV.5766Resumption1_spch034.txt,2007,5766,"Mr. Kim Hyun Chong (Republic of Korea): At the outset, I wish to join previous speakers in expressing my sincere gratitude to you, Mr. President, for holding this open debate on women and peace and security.  Over the seven years since the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women, peace and security, much has been achieved in terms of implementation by Member States, civil society and the United Nations system. The Secretary-General's report (S/2007/567) is a compilation of the reports on progress made by each entity. It notes, for example, the adoption by five entities of action plans for gender mainstreaming in their work on conflict prevention, the implementation of early-warning mechanisms by seven entities and the appointment of gender advisers in eleven peacekeeping missions.  Unfortunately, however, these efforts were rather fragmented and incoherent. So far, the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) is far from sufficient. Women continue to be excluded from or marginalized in peacemaking and peacebuilding processes. There has been some integration of gender perspectives, but it has not been systematic, nor has it adequately encompassed all facets of the process, including conflict prevention, early warning, peacekeeping operations, humanitarian responses, post-conflict reconstruction and rehabilitation.  Most disturbing to the Republic of Korea is the fact that sexual and gender-based violence in armed conflict is growing in many places. My delegation is particularly appalled by occurrences of systematic rape and sexual violence.  Paragraph 10 of the resolution  ""Calls on all parties to armed conflict to take special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence, particularly rape and other forms of sexual abuse, and all other forms of violence in situations of armed conflict."" Paragraph 11 emphasizes the responsibility of all States to put an end to impunity and to prosecute those responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, including those relating to sexual and other violence against women and girls.  The brutal facts of sexual violence against women and girls in many armed conflicts make it horribly clear that the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) has fallen far short of its intended aims.  My delegation believes that this poor implementation is not the fault of the Secretary- General or of the United Nations entities; rather, it is the Security Council's lack of accountability and the failure to implement the resolution.  The Secretary-General's report also identifies as key challenges fragmentation and insufficient institutional capacity for oversight and accountability for system performance. The report explains that the current action plan was not established as a tool for monitoring, evaluation and accountability, and its revised action plan attempts to fill that gap. While we appreciate this effort to improve reporting, we do not believe it is the solution to the greater problem.  What we most urgently need is a dedicated and effective Security Council mechanism for overall integration and implementation of the resolution in the Council's work. This mechanism would bear the responsibility to provide directives and to oversee, monitor and evaluate such implementation. Secondly, the Security Council urgently needs to address the serious situation of the sexual violation of women and girls.  It is the view of the Republic of Korea that, in implementing the resolution, we should consider regional approaches, including the utilization of existing regional arrangements. Effective regional entities could provide added value through their established networks, solidarity, communication and accessibility. However, we must keep in mind that the ultimate accountability lies with the Security Council, not with regional entities. Therefore, regional entities should play a complementary role, not act as substitutes. Nevertheless, as long as the participation of regional entities is making a substantial contribution to implementation, the regional approach will remain a valid one.  In addition, my country hopes that the dialogue for system-wide coherence regarding the gender architecture will be finalized as soon as possible to expedite a coherent response from the United Nations system across the board for women's empowerment.  My delegation looks forward to a concrete outcome from today's discussion. Through substantive improvements in the implementation mechanism and the strong will of the Security Council to end grave sexual violence in armed conflict, we can make real progress in implementation and reconfirm the accountability of the Security Council. The Republic of Korea is fully committed to ensuring the realization of the United Nations promise to women in armed conflicts.

UNSC_2008_SPV.6005_spch029.txt,2008,6005,"Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): We thank you, Mr. President, for organizing this debate, and we thank those who have offered briefings this morning. As a delegation that has supported resolution 1325 (2000) in its entirety since it was adopted, we agree that progress towards achieving its major goals has been slow and uneven. That is particularly true with regard to the low number of women appointed as Special Envoys and the continuing underrepresentation of women in formal peace processes and in peacekeeping missions. Your concept paper, Mr. President, and the report of the Secretary-General make it clear that we must considerably strengthen our efforts in that respect. We hope that the input provided during this debate will finally, eight years after the adoption of the resolution, lead to significant improvements.  Appointing more women to leading positions would have a catalytic effect and truly empower women affected by armed conflict. It would strengthen the perception that women are stakeholders 4 as opposed to mere victims or aid recipients. A few years ago, our then Permanent Representative in New York, Ambassador Fritsche, headed a group of like-minded ambassadors that tried to work towards an increase in the number of women in such positions. The group met regularly to exchange views and met with the Secretary-General for joint lobbying efforts. It was later taken over by the United Kingdom representative, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, but their effort was thereafter discontinued.  Several years later, it is sad to note that almost no progress has been made. Despite repeated expressions of good intent from all sides, a single woman currently serves as Special Representative of the Secretary- General, and women account for 28 per cent of higher- category civilian staff in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. We therefore fully support and reiterate today the call addressed to the Secretary- General by the Women's Leaders Working Group to establish, as a matter of high priority, a mechanism to increase the number of women in such positions as United Nations Special Representatives and Envoys, as well as heads of peace operations.  Existing programmes to increase the leadership and peacemaking capacities of women must be further expanded. We also believe that the creation of a gender unit within the Department of Peacekeeping Operations would contribute to that goal. With the adoption this year of Presidential No. Statement 36, the Security Council noted that women have an important role to play in mediation and the settlement of disputes. In particular at the grass-roots level, their role can be significantly more important than that of men. The Council must therefore institutionalize women's equal and substantive participation at all levels of peace processes and create mechanisms to monitor their equal participation systematically. There is a clear link between an increase in women's participation in peacekeeping missions and the potentially lower level of sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict situations. Since girls and women in affected regions often associate uniformed personnel with sexual violence, a higher number of women participating in peacekeeping and police forces will dramatically enhance the access of victims to social and psychological services, including trauma counselling and information-sharing on sexual harassment, abuse and rape.  Most importantly, of course, those who are supposed to provide protection must not, under any circumstances, themselves become perpetrators. All acts of sexual violence committed by peacekeeping personnel, including sexual exploitation and child prostitution, are unacceptable. They heavily undermine the credibility and effectiveness of any peace operation, but also of the Organization as a whole. Zero tolerance can therefore be the only policy in that respect.  The ultimate goal must be that the attitude and behaviour of peacekeepers towards women can serve as a model for local communities. Furthermore, the mandates of peacekeeping missions must provide clear guidance, especially for commanders, on how to protect civilians, in particular girls and women, from sexual violence. Predeployment and on-mission 30 training programmes must instruct police, security and humanitarian personnel on how to recognize and react to incidents of sexual violence.  Sexual violence is one of the most important aspects of resolution 1325 (2000). While it has always been part of armed conflicts, its systematic and targeted use in numerous situations today is not just a by-product of hostilities, or even just a war crime as recognized in the Rome Statute. It often is a method of warfare that aims to destroy the social fabric of communities in order to achieve political and military ends. It is against that background that we co-sponsored resolution 1820 (2008) on the protection of civilians from all forms of sexual violence.  We also welcome the adoption of presidential statement 2008/28 on children in armed conflict, referring to resolution 1820 (2008), and repeat our call for targeted sanctions against perpetrators of acts of sexual violence.

Germany associates itself with  the statement made by the French presidency of the  European Union and would like to add the following remarks.  We welcome the particular emphasis of this year's debate on the issue of women's equal participation and full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security. Resolution 1325 (2000) has given us a very clear mandate in that regard. Unfortunately, as today's debate and the report of the Secretary-General (S/2008/622) have shown, many structural and institutional impediments remain. We call upon the United Nations system and upon ourselves, the Member States, to step up our efforts leading to concrete advancement in the equal inclusion of women in peace talks, justice processes and peacekeeping.  Let me emphasize that Germany firmly believes that the creation of a strong and effective United Nations gender entity has to be part of those efforts. We hope that the Secretariat will soon provide the membership with the requested detailed paper on modalities, so that substantive action can be taken before the end of the current session of the General Assembly.  Resolution 1325 (2000) and the Secretary- General's report rightly emphasize the essential role of training United Nations staff, peacekeeping personnel and civil society as a means of ensuring the equal participation of women. Let me therefore highlight some best practices and some examples of how Germany actively contributes to the effective implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) in the field of training.  The Centre for International Peace Operations was established by the German Federal Government in June 2002 with the aim of enhancing Germany's civilian capacity for crisis prevention. The Centre's core mandate is the training, recruitment and support of German civilian personnel for peace operations and election observation missions, conducted in particular by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union (EU) and the United Nations. The Centre cooperates closely with international and other European training centres, such  as the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre in Ghana, and is a founding member of the EU Group on Training. Gender aspects, in particular the role of women in conflict resolution, are consistently taken into account in the design of training modules. Overall, since 2002, a total of 416 women from Germany and 129 women from abroad have participated in the Centre's training courses. In 2007, 52 per cent of participants in such training courses were women.  The German Government also funds a pilot project called the Mobile Peace Academy OMNIBUS 1325. That ""bus line"" has since toured several countries in the northern and southern Caucasus regions. On each of its stops, it has conducted train- the-trainer sessions with local non-governmental organizations, public officials, teachers and journalists on the relevance of resolution 1325 (2000) and on the integration of a gender perspective into their work for peace in the region. Just last week, the bus returned to Berlin and was greeted with a high-profile press conference.  The adoption in June this year of resolution 1820 (2008) on women and peace and security and sexual violence in armed conflict was a landmark achievement. It strengthened and further developed our commitment to the protection of women in situations of conflict and their active participation in the promotion of peace and security. Resolution 1820 (2008) created many new obligations for the United Nations, for the Security Council and for Member States. Inter alia, the Secretariat was asked to submit a comprehensive and operational report on the implementation of resolution 1820 (2008) by June 2009.  I am pleased to announce today that Germany has decided to provide the necessary funds for the recruitment of an additional policy specialist in the Peacekeeping Best Practices Section of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, whose task it will be to oversee coordination of that report. In addition, he or she will be tasked with designing a global strategy for the implementation of resolution 1820 (2008) and with developing and elaborating key training messages and an outreach and partnership strategy, including with troop- and police-contributing countries.  We are confident that Germany's financial contribution will significantly facilitate the submission of a report that will be substantive and operational and will allow us to further develop the vision of resolution 1820 (2008). We take that contribution as proof that Germany, as a friend of resolution 1325 (2000), is deeply committed to the vision of both landmark resolutions, 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008), and will continue to undertake concrete efforts for their implementation.

The genocide in Rwanda in 1994 witnessed some of the most inhumane acts of violence targeted at women and girls and the use of sexual violence as a tactic of genocide. The survivors of the genocide continue to live with the consequences of those crimes almost 15 years later. The perpetrators of these heinous crimes, the ex-forces armees rwandaises and interahamwe, now the Forces democratiques de liberation du Rwanda (FDLR), have been a main cause of regional insecurity in the Great Lakes region since 1994 and continue to be a major factor in the current situation in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. The FDLR continues to commit war crimes, crimes against humanity and numerous other human rights violations in the Great Lakes region.  Many regional and international agreements and instruments provide commendable mechanisms to deal with the threat posed by FDLR, but little or no attempt has been made to translate them into action. It is imperative that those agreements be put into action promptly to enable a lasting solution to the problem, which further threatens women in the Great Lakes region.  The equal participation of women in the promotion of peace and security in both conflict and post-conflict situations is integral to any peacekeeping, peacemaking or peacebuilding process. It is in that context that my Government has set out to ensure that women are central to the political, economic and social governance of our nation. Women today hold 56 per cent of seats in Parliament; head the Foreign, Information and Education Ministries, among others; head the police force and participate in peacekeeping missions; and hold command positions in the armed forces.  The participation of women in the maintenance and promotion of peace can begin to manifest itself only through sheer political will. The Government of Rwanda has made it abundantly clear that governance without the participation of more than of half the population is not governance.  Rwanda is a major troop-contributing country to United Nations peacekeeping operations and has a vested interest in preventing sexual violence in situations of armed conflict. Therefore, the Rwanda Defence Forces (RDF) considers gender-based violence and violence against women to be main components of the security threat. In that respect, the gender desk at Rwanda Defence Headquarters devises training programmes with the support of UNIFEM. to raise awareness of gender-based violence and violence against women in the armed forces.  Awareness of and training in how to respond to gender-based violence and violence against women has now been mainstreamed into the curriculum of all of Rwanda's military schools and training institutions and is integral to the preparation of all RDF battalions preparing for peacekeeping missions abroad. The participation of Rwandan policewomen in peacekeeping missions in the Sudan has further ensured that they raise awareness among the population in support of their missions.  We welcome the Secretary-General's report calling for an increase in resources and support to Governments in conflict or post-conflict situations to ensure the increased participation of women in the maintenance and promotion of peace. We also look forward to the establishment of a strengthened and consolidated United Nations gender entity.  My Government therefore reiterates its support for the continued implementation of Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) and the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa and will remain a strong advocate for the participation of women in all aspects of governance.

UNSC_2009_SPV.6196Resumption1_spch004.txt,2009,6196,"Mr. Matussek (Germany): Germany aligns herself with the statement made by Sweden on behalf of the European Union. As a member of the Group of Friends of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), we attach great importance to the issue of women and peace and security. I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for holding this open debate.  Women and children need to be protected from violence. Every day, we bear witness to unspeakable 09-54249  atrocities. This is especially the case in post-conflict situations in which police protection does not exist and judicial systems lie in shatters. Institutions need to be rebuilt, but protection cannot wait until the systems are fully functional. Protection must take place from the very first minute of peacebuilding - for the benefit of the victims but also for the benefit of the whole community, since rape and sexual violence destroy the very components of societies. Thus, sustainable peace cannot be achieved without the protection of the most vulnerable, namely, women and children.  Women are not only victims of conflicts but powerful agents for peace and security. Therefore, the empowerment of women to fulfil this potential is of the utmost importance. The system of granting microcredits to women has proved successful within the context of development cooperation. Empowering women would also help in security sector reform as well as disarmament, demobilization and reintegration processes. Women need to be included in peace negotiations and in decision-making processes for rebuilding countries and societies after they have been torn apart by war. Only by including the gender perspective in these efforts can a thorough, sustainable and all-inclusive peace be achieved.  What can Member States do? I will give the Council just a few examples. Germany has advocated the inclusion of gender advisers in all European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) missions. The mission of the European Union-led peacekeeping force in the Democratic Republic of the Congo had, for the first time, such an adviser among its personnel. During Germany's presidency, gender advisers were part of all ESDP missions. Also, the deployment of female soldiers enhanced the success of operations. For example, the presence of female soldiers to check women and children at checkpoints proved to de-escalate the situation on the ground. In Cambodia, Germany supports a project of the Ministry of Women's and Veteran's Affairs that focuses on capacity-building and gender mainstreaming. Finally, all German police and military personnel must undergo gender training.  What can the United Nations do? Security Council resolution 1888 (2009) and resolution 1889 (2009), adopted today, are yet another milestone in the fight against sexual violence and for the empowerment of women for the maintenance of peace and security. We now have a whole range of tools available to prevent 3 sexual violence and to respond rapidly to situations in which violence occurs. The new composite gender entity that the General Assembly has decided to establish as part of system-wide coherence will help to coordinate these and all other instruments that already exist within the United Nations. I echo the presidency of the European Union in calling upon the Secretary- General and his Deputy to quickly start working on the establishment of this entity.  Let me suggest and reiterate three more targets. The United Nations needs to continue working together with women's non-governmental organizations on the ground in post-conflict areas. It has to strive to include more women in peacekeeping missions at all levels and to improve its own performance, but also to set an example for the countries concerned. And United Nations entities must expand their activities related to the delivery of basic services that women in post- conflict situations need, especially access to health care, education and justice systems.  Next year is the tenth anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000). Let us try to reach these targets by that date so we will be able to proclaim some progress that will benefit and guide all people in the world that need our help and look to us for support.

UNSC_2010_SPV.6302_spch019.txt,2010,6302,"Mrs. Viotti (Brazil): I thank you, Mr. President, for organizing this briefing. We welcome Special Representative Margot Wallstrom and Assistant Secretary-General Rachel Mayanja, and thank them greatly for their important presentations.  In almost 10 years since the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), the international community has come a long way. We have come to understand more fully the implications of armed conflict for women and have also become more aware of their specific needs and roles in maintaining or restoring peace and security. Through resolution 1820 (2008), we have recognized the gravity of sexual violence in armed conflicts and have enhanced our action against it.  Resolution 1325 (2000) deals with women as agents of peace. Such a role comprises many facets, ranging from conflict prevention to post-conflict peacebuilding. I would like to briefly touch upon two such facets.  The first regards institutions. In post-conflict scenarios, where institutions are rebuilt and gradually consolidated, there is often a window of opportunity to surmount historical gender inequalities or insensitivities. It is precisely when the distribution of power and roles within a society is being redrawn after the trauma of war that efforts must be made to ensure that the concerns and needs of women are duly contemplated. That is especially applicable to such processes as constitutional, political and educational reforms.  The second aspect that I wish to stress relates to the economic empowerment of women in post-conflict situations, which is as important as institutional empowerment. The participation of women in efforts to rehabilitate and reactivate the economy is of particular relevance. Given the fundamental role played by women in key economic sectors, particularly in agriculture, the impact of development projects can be enhanced if such projects are focused on women.  Resolutions 1888 (2009) and 1889 (2009) took us further in our endeavours regarding women, peace and security, as they helped us to translate a wider awareness of challenges and opportunities into effective action. Among the decisions taken by the Security Council in those resolutions, two are particularly relevant due to their potential implications in the mid- and long terms. The first is the request to the Secretary-General to submit a set of indicators to track the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). The development of indicators is meant to allow for more rigorous and results-oriented interventions.  We appreciate the hard work that has gone into the report before us today. We look forward to the consultative process that will follow and give all stakeholders the opportunity to contribute to the further development of the proposed indicators. In that effort, we should consider the importance of focusing on qualitative rather than quantitative ways of measuring progress and of ensuring flexibility as challenges facing each country are different and should be recognized and treated as such. It would be important to guard against putting additional reporting burdens on developing States, especially those emerging from conflict. Collecting and aggregating data and preparing reports can be challenging tasks. Instead of being a mechanism for academic analysis, the indicators must support countries in their practical efforts to improve the situation of women in post-conflict situations.  The second important decision of the Security Council in 2009 regarding women, peace and security was the establishment of the post of Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict. It provides the United Nations system with an authoritative voice empowered to provide coherent and strategic leadership in the fight against sexual violence in conflict. It fills a void in helping different parts of the system to work more closely and effectively together.  We welcome Ms. Wallstrom's appointment to the position. We support her two forward-looking recommendations of continuous attention and of making prevention a top priority. We also support her five-point agenda, as it proposes a balanced set of measures focused both on the past and on the future, on accountability and on cooperation, on the perpetrators and on command responsibilities, and adds the very welcome focus on peer liability.  We commend Mrs. Wallstrom's initiative to visit the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We encourage and support increased efforts at cooperation with the Congolese Government in addressing capacity-building and other needs in the fight against sexual violence. We also appreciate the measures that have been taken by the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to improve women's security on the ground.  In concluding, let me also thank the Japanese delegation for preparing the draft presidential statement before us, which we fully support.

UNSC_2010_SPV.6411Resumption1_spch064.txt,2010,6411,"Mr. Vilovic' (Croatia): Let me begin by extending our congratulations to you, Mr. President, and your delegation on your presidency of the Security Council for the month of October, and by assuring you of the full support of my delegation. I also thank you and your delegation for initiating this meeting and bringing the Council together to discuss an issue that is critically important to the Republic of Croatia and, surely, to all nations.  Allow me to extend a warm welcome to Ms. Michelle Bachelet and wish her success in her future work as the first Executive Director of the newly established gender entity, UN Women, and Under- Secretary-General for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. Given her high political stature and experience, we deem that Ms. Bachelet will enhance the gender equality agenda and that UN Women will grow into the principal voice for gender mainstreaming and the empowerment of women. Croatia aligns itself with the statement delivered by the representative of Belgium on behalf of the European Union. Here, I would like to make additional remarks in my national capacity.  The adoption by the Security Council of resolution 1325 (2000) bears testimony to the progress made during the past decade in the area of women and peace and security. This historic resolution has focused much-needed attention on the question of women's empowerment, which represents a priority for my country. While all the resolutions on women and peace and security are equally important, resolution 1325 (2000) serves as an umbrella resolution in addressing women's empowerment, their task as peacebuilders and their fragile position as victims of war.  The Republic of Croatia welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of this landmark resolution (S/2010/498), the recommendations contained therein, as well as the presidential statement adopted by the Council today(S/PRST/2010/22). We call upon the Security Council to endorse the indicators developed by the Secretary-General as soon as possible.  The commitments set forth by the resolution are commendable, but translating words into action is the only way of resolving the remaining issues - and the issues are many. As numerous situations on the agenda of this Council have shown, women still have a long way to go in order to fulfil their empowerment goals as well as to fully realize their human rights, both in times of war and peace. The empowerment of women is imperative to the full achievement of human rights, as well as to overall economic and political development and progress. Although women are widely recognized as effective agents of peace, they still have little access to decision-making positions and peace negotiations. More should be done.  Armed conflicts continue to have a devastating impact on women and girls and are often accompanied by gender-based violence, including the increasing scale and brutality of sexual violence, often used as a means of war. Impunity for such acts of violence against women is still prevalent and the prosecution rate very low.  Even on Croatian territory, in the heart of Europe, rape was used as a method of intimidation and terror during the aggression to which Croatia was exposed in the early 19905. We are fully aware of the role both the Security Council and the international community can play in addressing sexual violence against women and girls, especially when used by political or military leaders as a means of achieving political or military objectives. We believe that the Security Council needs to provide strong and effective leadership on this issue, including by taking concrete action when necessary, with the ultimate aim of eradicating this abhorrent behaviour. Such acts of violence demand further action by the Security Council to strengthen the rule of law and to end impunity. They need to be thoroughly investigated and perpetrators brought to account, and it is therefore imperative for the International Criminal Court, as well as national courts, to be the last instance of justice for the victims and a reminder that there can be no tolerance for the crime of rape.  We are pleased to see that progress has been made in several areas and that the United Nations system continues to engage in a wide range of good practices. We encourage the strengthening of the coordination among United Nations agencies both at Headquarters and in the field, especially in monitoring and reporting on situations where parties to armed conflict engage in rape and other sexual violence as a means of war. Nevertheless, more consistent and comprehensive reporting on sexual violence would enable the Council to address the protection of women and children in a more systematic manner, whereas the Council should include specific reporting requirements in resolutions establishing or renewing mandates.  More needs to be done also at the national level. The integration of the resolution has to be country- driven, and Member States need to take responsibility for its success by ensuring that it is integrated into national policies. We urge countries to apply a broad gender-mainstreaming approach across Government, for instance through a system-wide approach that links development, humanitarian and defence issues. All plans should include civil society consultations, as well as monitoring and reporting mechanisms.  I am pleased to say that Croatia has taken steps to integrate the gender perspective into its national security policy through its national strategy for the promotion of gender equality, and is currently developing its national action plan on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), which is expected to be adopted in 2011. Under the leadership of its first female Prime Minister, Croatia will continue to give its firm support to all areas of the women and peace and security agenda. We see it as a gender-based peace agenda that involves addressing the disproportionate effect of conflict on women and combating sexual violence. It is also about securing the full, equal and effective participation of women at all stages of the peace process, giving them an equal role in the prevention and resolution of conflicts, as well as in peacebuilding. The realization of these goals is essential to safeguarding basic human rights and achieving human security and lasting peace.

Even on Croatian territory, in the heart of Europe, rape was used as a method of intimidation and terror during the aggression to which Croatia was exposed in the early 19905. We are fully aware of the role both the Security Council and the international community can play in addressing sexual violence against women and girls, especially when used by political or military leaders as a means of achieving political or military objectives. We believe that the Security Council needs to provide strong and effective leadership on this issue, including by taking concrete action when necessary, with the ultimate aim of eradicating this abhorrent behaviour. Such acts of violence demand further action by the Security Council to strengthen the rule of law and to end impunity. They need to be thoroughly investigated and perpetrators brought to account, and it is therefore imperative for the International Criminal Court, as well as national courts, to be the last instance of justice for the victims and a reminder that there can be no tolerance for the crime of rape.  We are pleased to see that progress has been made in several areas and that the United Nations system continues to engage in a wide range of good practices. We encourage the strengthening of the coordination among United Nations agencies both at Headquarters and in the field, especially in monitoring and reporting on situations where parties to armed conflict engage in rape and other sexual violence as a means of war. Nevertheless, more consistent and comprehensive reporting on sexual violence would enable the Council to address the protection of women and children in a more systematic manner, whereas the Council should include specific reporting requirements in resolutions establishing or renewing mandates.  More needs to be done also at the national level. The integration of the resolution has to be country- driven, and Member States need to take responsibility for its success by ensuring that it is integrated into national policies. We urge countries to apply a broad gender-mainstreaming approach across Government, for instance through a system-wide approach that links development, humanitarian and defence issues. All plans should include civil society consultations, as well as monitoring and reporting mechanisms.  I am pleased to say that Croatia has taken steps to integrate the gender perspective into its national security policy through its national strategy for the promotion of gender equality, and is currently developing its national action plan on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), which is expected to be adopted in 2011. Under the leadership of its first female Prime Minister, Croatia will continue to give its firm support to all areas of the women and peace and security agenda. We see it as a gender-based peace agenda that involves addressing the disproportionate effect of conflict on women and combating sexual violence. It is also about securing the full, equal and effective participation of women at all stages of the peace process, giving them an equal role in the prevention and resolution of conflicts, as well as in peacebuilding. The realization of these goals is essential to safeguarding basic human rights and achieving human security and lasting peace.

UNSC_2011_SPV.6642Resumption1_spch052.txt,2011,6642,"Mr. Faqiri (Afghanistan): I thank you, Madam President, for convening today's debate, which offers us all an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to protecting and ensuring women's rights and their momentous role in peace and security. I also take the opportunity to thank the Secretary-General for his report (S/2011/598*) and his strong words of support. And I thank Ms. Michelle Bachelet, Under-Secretary- General for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, for her work and for her statement.  The history of war and violence has left a disconcerting impact on my country. Violence still takes its toll on every Afghan's life. I hope that the anguish facing every Afghan family will one day come to an end. Women continue to bear the bulk of the burden of conflict in Afghanistan, while their right to secure, healthy and prosperous lives is still in peril. We meet today to recognize the crucial role of women in the peaceful resolution of conflicts, the tangible fruits of which have already been seen in Afghanistan in the decisive presence of women at the Consultative Peace Jirga in 2010 and in the continuing efforts to ensure women's participation in leadership positions within and outside of the Afghan Government. The debate is particularly appropriate as Afghanistan is entering the second phase of transition to Afghan leadership and ownership and increased responsibility for security and economic development.  With regard to development, we have begun to implement our 10-year national action plan for the women of Afghanistan based upon the priorities of the Afghanistan National Development Strategy. As part of the action plan, we have established gender units in 14 of the 25 Government ministries. However, given the 10-year timeline, accelerated efforts are necessary to ensure the full implementation of that very comprehensive action plan, which incorporates vital goals that include achieving a 30 per cent rate of representation of women in governmental positions by the end of 2013 and their 35 per cent participation rate among university students by the end of 2012.  We have also made strides in ensuring the rule of law, most recently the establishment of a national commission on the elimination of violence against women, following the enactment of the law in that regard in December 2010. Those steps have been vital in enhancing Afghan women's access to legal redress and have also sent a strong message that the Afghanistan Government is committed to the rights of women and to ensuring that there is no impunity for those who violate them.  Ensuring the rights of women is only half of the battle; we also need to see the full participation of women, as resolution 1325 (2000) reminds us that they have a vital role to play in peace and security. The representation of women in governance and their political participation has steadily increased. We have succeeded in holding two presidential and two parliamentary elections, in which women actively participated as candidates, elections staff, poll monitors and electorates.  Women comprise 25 per cent of the Parliament, thus ranking Afghanistan thirtieth among the countries of the world with the highest rate of women representatives in Parliament. The Afghanistan National Parliament has also established a resource centre for women parliamentarians to enhance their capacity to effectively include women's voices and perspectives in national development and reconstruction plans.  When reviewing these facts and figures, let us not lose sight of the great personal risk that these women undertake in order to participate in the governance of their country and in their future. I wish to take this opportunity to honour the women who continue take risks in order to assume an active role in the future direction, peace and security of our country.  Our international partners have assisted the Afghan Government in our endeavours. UN-Women has administered a multi-donor trust fund for the elimination of violence against women that provided grants for national organizations to combat violence against women. I am very pleased to report that, in collaboration with UN-Women, Afghanistan has submitted its first country report on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The continued collaboration of our Government, international partners and both Afghan and international civil society groups will be vital to ensure the full realization of women's rights in a strong and stable Afghanistan.  Building a stable and secure environment that enables women to live free of intimidation and violence and promotes their participation and leadership in efforts to maintain peace and security is one of the core objectives of the Afghan Government.  We are also focusing on women political actors at national, subnational and local levels, as well as on capacity-building and advocacy strategies to enable them to obtain critical roles in high-level decision- making processes, policy and law-making positions in key Government institutions and to assist them in carrying out their significant political and social responsibilities.  In conclusion, with the support of our partners and the international community, we will continue to work towards the full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), while recognizing that our goal of sustainable peace and security in Afghanistan will not be achieved without the full participation of the entire Afghan nation.

UNSC_2012_SPV.6722_spch023.txt,2012,6722,"Mr. Reynders (Belgium) (spoke in French): Let me begin by thanking the Secretary-General for the report on conflict-related sexual violence (S/2012/33). I also wish to thank Ms. Margot Wallstrom, Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, and her team of experts. It is impossible to remain indifferent in reading the report, for sexual violence in many societies is still a common practice, often invisible and too rarely prosecuted.  Belgium has always been a strong defender of resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security. It formally promises to remain so.  Belgium associates itself with the statement to be made on behalf of the European Union.  I would like to address three subjects.  First is the mandate of the Special Representative, which for Belgium is very clear. It allows the Security Council to focus on sexual violence not only in classic conflict situations but also in post-conflict situations or other serious situations, such as political unrest. The Council already regularly takes up such issues in various types of situations. I welcome the reference in the report to instances of sexual violence in situations of unrest and instability, particularly in Egypt and Syria. To reduce the mandate  12-2393] solely to cases of sexual violence in conflict situations would be tantamount to restricting the role of the United Nations in defending individuals and societies that suffer from this terrible scourge. We cannot retreat from the detailed mandate set out in resolution 1960 (2010).  Furthermore, while sexual Violence mainly affects women and girls, the Secretary-General's report makes very clear that the situation of men, especially those in custody, as well as children born as a result of rape, deserves greater attention from us. Rather than seeking to lock the mandate into too limited an area of action, we should develop a comprehensive approach to protecting civilians.  My second comment concerns some particular recommendations in the report, first, that concerning initiatives and modalities relating to security sector reform, It is indeed our duty to ensure that those who perpetrate, command or condone sexual violence are excluded from all branches of government, including the armed forces and police. In addition, United Nations mediators and officials also must ensure that sexual violence is included in the definition of conduct prohibited by ceasefire and peace agreements. Indeed, Belgium calls particularly for an increase in the number of women serving as mediators and special envoys.  Finally, the third recommendation that I wish to underline concerns prevention, which is often more effective than reparation. That is why Belgium supports any initiative aimed at adopting early warning systems that could detect risks of imminent sexual violence in regions affected by conflict.  My third and final comment relates to situations in some particular countries. The Special Representative has visited the Democratic Republic of the Congo several times to discuss with top Government officials the issue of sexual violence, often committed by military personnel. Belgium was among the first to provide financial support for the Democratic Republic of the Congo's national strategy to combat sexual violence. We also provided financial support to the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for military judges to assist with the  12-2393]  prosecution of soldiers accused of sexual violence in the eastern part of the country. Belgium intends to remain engaged in this project, in consultation with the Special Representative and with national authorities.  As Chair of the Peacebuilding Commission's Central African Republic configuration, Belgium attributes particular importance to the issue of sexual Violence in that country. The Central African Republic is on the priority list for action by the Special Representative. The problem of Violence against women and children is discussed during each Commission field visit, and regular contact on the subject is maintained with the Office of the Special Representative.  The reports on the situations in Libya, Egypt and Syria are particularly relevant in the context of the so-called Arab Spring. The issue of sexual violence in countries in transition should not be ignored. I am deeply concerned at reports by the United Nations commission of inquiry to the effect that Syrian armed forces and security personnel have used sexual torture against detainees in various detention centers of the intelligence and political security services. I trust we shall have an opportunity to speak of that tomorrow, in the framework of the meeting of the friends of Syria in Tunis.  In conclusion, I would like to stress the collective responsibility for the fight against sexual violence. The Security Council must act on this report, in particular by transmitting to the sanctions committees the list of parties responsible for sexual violence, which is annexed to the report, for effective follow-up. The development of that list is a first, for which I congratulate the Secretary-General.  I sincerely trust that the team of the Special Representative will continue their excellent work. I believe their report is one stage and that there will be more.

UNSC_2012_SPV.6722Resumption1_spch012.txt,2012,6722,"Mr. Guerber (Switzerland): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Human Security Network, namely, Austria, Chile, Costa Rica, Greece, Ireland, Jordan, Mali, Norway, Panama, Slovenia, Thailand, South Africa as an observer, and my own country, Switzerland.  We would like to thank the Togolese presidency for having convened this important open debate on women, peace and security, an issue that is at the core of the Human Security Network.  Let us further thank the Secretary-General for his report and his Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Ms. Margot Wallstrom, for her outstanding work and commitment to this sensitive and complex issue. The Human Security Network shares the views expressed by the Secretary-General in his recommendations to the Security Council, Member States, donors and regional organizations. 12-23937  Since the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), we have witnessed significant advances in this field, including resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010), the creation of the post of the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, as well as the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict, which contribute significantly to strengthening the cooperation between the United Nations system and Member States in order to prevent crimes against women and girls. In addition, they help to improve the efficiency of the national judicial systems in ensuring the rule of law and bringing perpetrators to justice, including to the International Criminal Court.  However, it is deeply disturbing that today we continue to witness rapes of women, girls and children in general, in countries in armed conflict but also in other situations, including post-conflict situations. We recognize the efforts made by some Governments to put an end to these crimes, to strengthen judicial systems and to bring those responsible to justice. However, as the Secretary-General's report (S/2012/33) shows, progress remains slow, and in practice the perpetrators of crimes against women and girls often go unpunished.  The Human Security Network therefore urges Member States to increase their efforts to prevent conflict-related sexual violence by undertaking all necessary efforts to implement all applicable legal provisions in the matter. The primary responsibility is theirs. But, at the same time, this constitutes a challenge for the international community as a whole, especially for regional and subregional organizations. Their role in supporting the efforts of those countries is crucial. The message must be clear; there shall be no impunity for the perpetrators of such crimes, and the countries affected and the international community will not rest until there is accountability and justice is done.  The provision of genuine support, protection and the relevant services to the victims and their families is equally as important as rendering justice. In that context, the support given at the community level is vital. Projects that directly assist victims and their families to help them overcome the trauma inflicted upon them are of particularly great value.  One of the key issues in a post-conflict country is security sector reform. Security is not a ""men's issue""; it is a gender issue, and women must be involved in all  relevant discussions and negotiations from their inception, and they must also be part of the higher military ranks, which is where security-related issues are usually discussed. The gender perspective must be part of the reform and training of all security forces.  The Human Security Network emphasizes the importance of the full and equal participation of women in political processes, including in peacemaking and peacebuilding. Their involvement ensures the success of those processes. At the same time, conflict-related sexual violence and the specific needs of women and girls have to be addressed adequately, both in ceasefire agreements and in peace agreements.  Preventing crimes is as crucial as delivering justice and supporting the victims. To that end, we have to be able to improve the early warning systems and monitoring mechanisms already in place and to build upon them where needed. They must be capable of detecting signs of possible crimes and must mobilize the political and judicial authorities in order to prevent them. They must involve all relevant levels, from the community level to the provincial and national levels. Regional organizations can also play an important role in the creation of an efficient early warning system.  Finally, we appreciate the information provided on the progress made in implementing the monitoring, analysis and reporting arrangements. The collection of timely, accurate, reliable and objective information on conflict-related sexual violence is crucial to tailoring the Council's responses, as well as to enhancing action to prevent sexual violence. We also wish to encourage the deployment of women protection advisers to United Nations peacekeeping and special political missions in order to strengthen the response of the relevant mission components to conflict-related sexual violence.  We strongly hope that the Council will be able to reach an agreement on the presidential statement later today.  (spoke in French)  I will now make a statement in my national capacity. A more detailed version of my statement can be found in the distributed text.  Resolutions 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010) on women and peace and security constitute a robust machinery, which demonstrates that the Security Council and United Nations members are firmly  resolved to move from advocacy to the effective implementation of their commitment to combat conflict-related sexual violence. The establishment of new mandates always raises the crucial issue of coordination and the efficient use of existing structures.  We welcome the fact that it is intended to preserve the full flexibility of the monitoring, analysis and reporting arrangements in order to adapt them to the country-specific needs and circumstances. In that regard, we would like to underscore the importance of the continued and transparent communication of the Office of the Special Representative with United Nations country teams so as to foster ownership and results-oriented implementation of the new structures and processes in the field.  We note with great satisfaction that several activities have been launched with UN-Women. We hope that such productive cooperation will continue. Switzerland recently contributed 3 million Swiss francs to the United Nations Trust Fund to End Violence against Women, which is administered by UN-Women.  The Secretary-General's report on conflict-related sexual violence contains useful recommendations to the Security Council, Member States and regional organizations. I would like to recall three of those, in particular.  First, prevention is a priority as it is an essential part of our efforts to protect, in which many stakeholders have a role to play. Specific and time- bound commitments to put an end to all acts of sexual violence and to bring their perpetrators to justice can help to break the cycle of violence.  We strongly support more systematic measures to enhance protection against sexual violence and prevention of its recurrence through transitional justice mechanisms. Such measures should link the fight against impunity and recognition of victims' rights, for example through appropriate reparations, but also include strengthening the national capacity to combat the causes of violence and, at the same time, to prevent new cases.  Secondly, in resolution 1820 (2008), the Security Council resolved to take acts of sexual violence into consideration when establishing or renewing State- specific sanctions regimes. That opportunity should not be forgotten. It thus provides the means to take targeted measures against, for example, the parties and individuals mentioned in the Secretary-General's report on sexual violence in conflict.  Finally, in his report, the Secretary-General calls on the parties to include training on conflict-related sexual violence in training programmes for peacekeeping troops. In that regard, I would like to draw the Council's attention to the handbook prepared by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, entitled ""Standardized Best Practices Toolkit on Gender and Policing in Peacekeeping Operations"". The handbook was co-financed by Switzerland.  The structures set up by resolutions 1888 (2009), 1889 (2009) and 1960 (2010) are still in a testing phase, and only proof of the reality will make it possible to assess their effectiveness. The path is steep and rocky. However, we should move forward prudently and resolutely in strengthening the protection architecture. The establishment of the mandate of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict is a significant part of that course.  ",Mr. Guerber,Switzerland,English,m," I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Human Security Network, namely, Austria, Chile, Costa Rica, Greece, Ireland, Jordan, Mali, Norway, Panama, Slovenia, Thailand, South Africa as an observer, and my own country, Switzerland.

However, as the Secretary-General's report (S/2012/33) shows, progress remains slow, and in practice the perpetrators of crimes against women and girls often go unpunished.  The Human Security Network therefore urges Member States to increase their efforts to prevent conflict-related sexual violence by undertaking all necessary efforts to implement all applicable legal provisions in the matter. The primary responsibility is theirs. But, at the same time, this constitutes a challenge for the international community as a whole, especially for regional and subregional organizations. Their role in supporting the efforts of those countries is crucial. The message must be clear; there shall be no impunity for the perpetrators of such crimes, and the countries affected and the international community will not rest until there is accountability and justice is done.  The provision of genuine support, protection and the relevant services to the victims and their families is equally as important as rendering justice. In that context, the support given at the community level is vital. Projects that directly assist victims and their families to help them overcome the trauma inflicted upon them are of particularly great value.  One of the key issues in a post-conflict country is security sector reform. Security is not a ""men's issue""; it is a gender issue, and women must be involved in all  relevant discussions and negotiations from their inception, and they must also be part of the higher military ranks, which is where security-related issues are usually discussed. The gender perspective must be part of the reform and training of all security forces.  The Human Security Network emphasizes the importance of the full and equal participation of women in political processes, including in peacemaking and peacebuilding. Their involvement ensures the success of those processes. At the same time, conflict-related sexual violence and the specific needs of women and girls have to be addressed adequately, both in ceasefire agreements and in peace agreements.  Preventing crimes is as crucial as delivering justice and supporting the victims. To that end, we have to be able to improve the early warning systems and monitoring mechanisms already in place and to build upon them where needed. They must be capable of detecting signs of possible crimes and must mobilize the political and judicial authorities in order to prevent them. They must involve all relevant levels, from the community level to the provincial and national levels. Regional organizations can also play an important role in the creation of an efficient early warning system.  Finally, we appreciate the information provided on the progress made in implementing the monitoring, analysis and reporting arrangements. The collection of timely, accurate, reliable and objective information on conflict-related sexual violence is crucial to tailoring the Council's responses, as well as to enhancing action to prevent sexual violence. We also wish to encourage the deployment of women protection advisers to United Nations peacekeeping and special political missions in order to strengthen the response of the relevant mission components to conflict-related sexual violence.  We strongly hope that the Council will be able to reach an agreement on the presidential statement later today.  (spoke in French)  I will now make a statement in my national capacity. A more detailed version of my statement can be found in the distributed text.  Resolutions 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010) on women and peace and security constitute a robust machinery, which demonstrates that the Security Council and United Nations members are firmly  resolved to move from advocacy to the effective implementation of their commitment to combat conflict-related sexual violence. The establishment of new mandates always raises the crucial issue of coordination and the efficient use of existing structures.  We welcome the fact that it is intended to preserve the full flexibility of the monitoring, analysis and reporting arrangements in order to adapt them to the country-specific needs and circumstances. In that regard, we would like to underscore the importance of the continued and transparent communication of the Office of the Special Representative with United Nations country teams so as to foster ownership and results-oriented implementation of the new structures and processes in the field.  We note with great satisfaction that several activities have been launched with UN-Women. We hope that such productive cooperation will continue. Switzerland recently contributed 3 million Swiss francs to the United Nations Trust Fund to End Violence against Women, which is administered by UN-Women.  The Secretary-General's report on conflict-related sexual violence contains useful recommendations to the Security Council, Member States and regional organizations. I would like to recall three of those, in particular.  First, prevention is a priority as it is an essential part of our efforts to protect, in which many stakeholders have a role to play. Specific and time- bound commitments to put an end to all acts of sexual violence and to bring their perpetrators to justice can help to break the cycle of violence.  We strongly support more systematic measures to enhance protection against sexual violence and prevention of its recurrence through transitional justice mechanisms. Such measures should link the fight against impunity and recognition of victims' rights, for example through appropriate reparations, but also include strengthening the national capacity to combat the causes of violence and, at the same time, to prevent new cases.  Secondly, in resolution 1820 (2008), the Security Council resolved to take acts of sexual violence into consideration when establishing or renewing State- specific sanctions regimes. That opportunity should not be forgotten. It thus provides the means to take targeted measures against, for example, the parties and individuals mentioned in the Secretary-General's report on sexual violence in conflict.  Finally, in his report, the Secretary-General calls on the parties to include training on conflict-related sexual violence in training programmes for peacekeeping troops. In that regard, I would like to draw the Council's attention to the handbook prepared by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, entitled ""Standardized Best Practices Toolkit on Gender and Policing in Peacekeeping Operations"". The handbook was co-financed by Switzerland.  The structures set up by resolutions 1888 (2009), 1889 (2009) and 1960 (2010) are still in a testing phase, and only proof of the reality will make it possible to assess their effectiveness. The path is steep and rocky. However, we should move forward prudently and resolutely in strengthening the protection architecture. The establishment of the mandate of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict is a significant part of that course.

UNSC_2012_SPV.6877_spch051.txt,2012,6877,"Ms. Skare: Thank you, Mr. President, for letting NATO participate in this important debate. I would also like to thank the briefers for their excellent presentations.  Civil society organizations have been instrumental in promoting women's rights and gender equality. To a large degree, it was thanks to civil society that resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security saw the light of day 12 years ago. As much as States and intergovernmental organizations show leadership in advancing that agenda, we have to recognize the important role that members of civil society play as opinion leaders and sources of information, as well as in keeping us accountable.  While States have the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of the resolutions on women and peace and security, NATO, as a political-military organization, is playing its part within NATO-led operations and within our partnerships. We have a policy, we have an action plan and, together with partners, we are turning words into deeds.  On the political level, NATO is actively encouraging all its partners to adopt specific goals related to the promotion of women, peace and security issues in the various partnership programmes they develop with our organization. The overall aim is to raise awareness and to work towards greater female participation in the areas of defence and security. Women are still underrepresented in peace and reconciliation processes, and we encourage States and our partners to ensure women's participation in the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts.  At the operational level, NATO and its operational partners in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and Kosovo Force have demonstrated a strong commitment to promoting the important role that women can play, and have engaged with women leaders and activists to understand their views and perspectives. The Alliance has gender advisers and focal points at its various headquarters, as well as in operational theatres in Afghanistan and Kosovo. I work with these dedicated people and see the significant efforts they are making to mainstream resolution 1325 (2000) and related resolutions and to integrate the gender perspective into operations.  Experience to date has shown that having gender expertise, as well as having more female soldiers in theatre, improves our ability to conduct operations more effectively. For example, we have learned that female soldiers in Afghanistan are at times able to better connect with members of the population otherwise closed off from their male colleagues. This has led to greater awareness of the specific situation and area, and led to better dialogue and understanding between NATO forces and the local community. Our experience has also shown that training and education are strategic tools for security forces and for defence and security sector reform. Ifused correctly, they can be major force multipliers, as the attitudes of those trained can spread to walks of life beyond the security sphere.  As Council members are aware, the mandate of the ISAF mission was recently renewed, and the plans to hand over full security responsibility from ISAF forces to their Afghan counterparts are on course, as reaffirmed at the Chicago Summit. Throughout the transition process and beyond, we will continue to focus on gender-related training and to support the recruitment and retention of women in the security forces.  NATO works shoulder to shoulder with other international organizations maintaining international peace and security, and we seek to strengthen further our cooperation with the United Nations and others to make sure we learn from each other's experiences and pave the way for greater efficiency and more results.  Since my appointment as the NATO Secretary General's Special Representative for Women, Peace and Security, I have had the great pleasure of engaging in dialogue with women's associations in the security sector, womens' rights activists, female parliamentarians and other representatives of civil society. I intend to deepen this dialogue.  NATO and its member States remain committed to upholding human rights and the rule of law. As we face up to the security challenges of the twenty- first century, we will continue to work with partners and other members of the international community to achieve better security and the greater empowerment of women.

UNSC_2013_SPV.6948_spch067.txt,2013,6948,"Mr. Khan (Indonesia): Allow me to begin by commending the President's work on convening today's debate on the issue of sexual violence in conflict. This timely debate highlights the urgent need to address the various forms of violence perpetrated against women and girls. Despite all the achievements and progress that have been made in promoting the protection and rights of women, such violence persists all over the world. Indonesia also wishes to thank the Secretary- General for his report on sexual violence in conflict (S/2013/l49), which is a valuable starting point for our deliberations today on improving ways to eliminate and prevent violence against women, particularly in conflict situations.  At the outset, Indonesia associates itself with the statement delivered by the representative of Viet Nam on behalf of the member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.  Indonesia notes with deep concern the use of sexual violence as a tactic of war and one that worsens its consequences, as highlighted in the Secretary- General's report. Against that backdrop, Indonesia condemns all forms of violence against women and girls in armed conflicts, particularly sexual violence, which, as the report states, predominantly affects women and girls but can also affect men and boys. We wish to reaffirm our support for resolution 1325 (2000), the first to specifically address the impact of war on women and women's contributions to conflict resolution and sustainable peace. The follow-up Security Council resolutions on women, peace and security also constitute a milestone for protection and empowerment measures for women in the special situation of conflict.  Indonesia commends the adoption of the agreed conclusions of the fifty-seventh session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), last month, as a manifestation of the intergovernmental efforts that have been made by countries under the United Nations framework. The agreement reached on the agreed conclusions is a step forward in strengthening countries' commitment to tackling violence against women and girls.  The CSW conclusions send a clear and strong message: violence against women and girls committed in armed conflict and post-conflict situations is strongly condemned; sexual and gender-based violence, which affects victims, families, communities and societies, is recognized; and effective accountability and redress measures, as well remedies, are required.  At the national level, Indonesia's national action plan on human rights serves as a strong platform for our commitment to eliminate and prevent violence against women. The process of drafting a presidential decree is ongoing, as a legal basis to formulate a national action plan on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). When completed, the action plan, among things, will cover all phases ofthe peace process - from prevention to ending conflict to recovery from social conflict.  Indonesia wishes to highlight some of the main challenges in our efforts to eliminate and further  prevent violence against women, including sexual violence: first, insufficient gender-sensitive policies; secondly, inadequate implementation of legal and policy frameworks; thirdly, inadequate data collection, analysis and research; fourthly, the lack of financial and human resources and insufficient allocation of such resources; and, fifthly, the lack of comprehensive, consistent, sustained, transparent and adequately monitored and evaluated efforts.  Those gaps have yet to be bridged by States as the bearers of the primary responsibility in addressing the issue ofviolence against women and its impact, in order to translate commitments into practical approaches and actions on the ground, to fashion more compassionate responses for victims, to pursue more aggressive prosecutions of perpetrators and to create more secure communities and environments.  With its multifold economic, social and cultural consequences, sexual violence in conflict hampers not only women and men victims, but also their families and communities. Therefore, Indonesia supports the six-point priority agenda established by the former and current Special Representatives of the Secretary- General on Sexual Violence in Conflict.  To conclude, Indonesia would like to reiterate the importance of the international community, including the United Nations, as the key stakeholder, joining hands and providing support for States to address the remaining gaps and tackle the gravity of the situation. Indonesia also urges all parties to conflict to comply with international humanitarian and human rights law.

We would also like to thank the Secretary-General and the other briefers for their valuable contributions. We hope that today we can together generate a strong political will that can enable us to improve the implementation of the existing Security Council instruments, strengthen the mechanisms of national and international law and increase assistance to the victims.

That framework not only asks us to fight sexual violence effectively in times of conflict, it also commits us to supporting women as active agents for change. The United Nations has developed indicators; the Security Council has created a mandate for a Special Representative and made the decision to establish the monitoring, analysis and reporting arrangements mechanism. With our partners from Liechtenstein, Switzerland has supported the NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security, PeaceWomen and the Global Network of Women Peacebuilders in making available to Council members a bulletin of monthly action points, a handbook and even an iPhone app, and in ensuring close ties between policymaking levels in New York and the realities on the ground.

We therefore gratefully welcome today's resolution 2106 (2013), which will support those efforts.  First and foremost, however, prevention is essential. We must break the cycles of violence. All parties to a conflict must make specific commitments to combat sexual violence and hold perpetrators accountable.

It is therefore imperative to ensure careful follow- up and to prevent acts of revenge by strengthening local capacities.

The zero- tolerance policy must be urgently implemented, and everyone must be resolutely committed to bringing perpetrators to justice.  International humanitarian law prohibits rape and other forms of sexual violence. Such crimes can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide. International tribunals, especially the International Criminal Court, play a key role in punishing and preventing such crimes. For that reason, it is crucial that all States lend their full support to those institutions, not forgetting that the fight against impunity for perpetrators of sexual Violence must primarily be carried out at the national level.

I would also like to thank the Council presidency for taking up the topic and organizing the open debate today.  Estonia aligns itself with the statement of the European Union delivered earlier. In addition, I would like to make the following remarks.  Estonia is dedicated to protecting and promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms, both nationally and internationally. As a member of the Human Rights Council, our particular focus is on the rights of women and children, gender perspective in conflict settlements and the fight against impunity. Estonia firmly believes that the rule of law in conflict and post-conflict situations must promote justice and accountability in ways that further the rights of women, including through legal and institutional reforms that are gender sensitive. The equal right to decision-making and participation, along with women's empowerment, is crucial to ensure a functioning society and peace and justice in the aftermath of conflicts.  Additionally, as stated in the Secretary-General's report (S/2013/525), women's representation in the justice sector plays a significant role in increasing the reporting of crimes and enhancing public trust in the rule of law institutions. The importance of prevention must likewise be stressed. By enabling women to fully participate in judicial systems, we can better tackle the root causes of impunity for Violence against women.  Estonia welcomes the call by the Security Council in today's resolution to Member States to comply with their relevant obligations to end impunity and to thoroughly investigate and prosecute persons responsible for atrocity crimes. Estonia further agrees with the Council that the fight against impunity for the most serious crimes of international concern against women and girls has been strengthened through the work of the International Criminal Court (ICC), the ad hoc and mixed tribunals, and the specialized chambers in national tribunals. ICC prosecutions will not, however, be sufficient to ensure complete accountability. Therefore, it is essential that the gender provisions of the Rome Statute are translated into national prosecutions.  Justice for victims of atrocity crimes, however, entails more thanjust punishing perpetrators. The Rome Statute further empowers victims by its broad victim- participation scheme and underlines its commitment to victims by its reparations provisions. Likewise, the ICC Trust Fund for Victims has been doing important work to alleviate the suffering of Victims in the countries where the Court is conducting investigations.  Estonia was honoured to join the Declaration of Commitment to End Sexual Violence in Conflict during the General Assembly's opening week. We were also glad to see how much interest there was in the topic of enhancing accountability for sexual violence in conflict, discussed at a side event during that week that focused on the role of the ICC and that was hosted by the Estonian Mission to the United Nations. We would like to commend the important work of the Team of Experts on Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict, and I am glad to note that Estonia has made financial contributions to the activities of the Team.  Estonia would also like to take the opportunity to emphasize that in addition to conflict-related sexual violence, increased attention should be paid to the full range of violations and serious crimes experienced by women, including gendered impacts of enforced disappearances, foreign occupation, mass forced displacement, restrictions on humanitarian aid, conflict-related trafficking and the destruction of civilian infrastructure.  Let me also commend UN Women for their work targeted at raising the number of national action plans related to resolution 1325 (2000) or other relevant planning instruments, as outlined in the recently adopted UN Women Strategic Plan. Estonia developed its national action plan in 2010 and has advised a number of States on developing theirs. We would be ready to cooperate in that regard with other States in the future. We are looking forward to hearing the results of the global study, and to the high-level review in 2015.  In conclusion, we are glad to note that Estonia was among the sponsors of resolution 2106 (2013), which strengthens the monitoring and prevention of sexual violence in conflict, and we were happy to co-sponsor resolution 2122 (2013), adopted today.  ",Mr. Kolga,Estonia,English,m," At the outset, allow me to join others in expressing gratitude to the Secretary- General, the Executive Director of UN Women, the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the representative of the Non-governmental Organization Working Group on Women, Peace and Security for their statements. I would also like to thank the Council presidency for taking up the topic and organizing the open debate today.  Estonia aligns itself with the statement of the European Union delivered earlier. In addition, I would like to make the following remarks.  Estonia is dedicated to protecting and promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms, both nationally and internationally. As a member of the Human Rights Council, our particular focus is on the rights of women and children, gender perspective in conflict settlements and the fight against impunity. Estonia firmly believes that the rule of law in conflict and post-conflict situations must promote justice and accountability in ways that further the rights of women, including through legal and institutional reforms that are gender sensitive.

UNSC_2014_SPV.7160_spch008.txt,2014,7160,"Ms. Power (United States of America): Madam President, I would like thank the Secretary-General, Special Representative Bangura, and Ms. Misaka for their informative and powerful briefings.  In the past decade, the Security Council has identified the scourge of sexual violence in conflict as a matter of acute and urgent concern. We meet today to assess progress in combating that pernicious form of criminality and to consider next steps. We begin with confidence that the standards we have established are clear and the terrible knowledge that those standards are regularly being ignored. We have made abundantly clear that there should be zero tolerance for rape and zero tolerance for other forms of sexual abuse in all circumstances and at all times. The terror of sexual violence is uniquely horrific and merits our continued and determined efforts to eliminate it. Neither the fog of war nor the associated breakdown of law provide any explanation or excuse for actions that violate the rights and disrespect the fundamental dignity of human beings.  To articulate a zero-tolerance standard is, of course, not difficult. Indeed, we have done it many times. But to endow it with real meaning in real conflicts remains a challenge of great urgency and one of many dimensions. This is not work that should be delegated only to a Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, even one as capable as Special Representative Bangura, or to women's protection advisers in a peacekeeping mission or to UN-Women. Those offices and officials and the United Nations as a whole assuredly have an indispensable role to play, but the key to further progress in reducing suffering and in protecting the vulnerable is action by the parties to conflict. Every Government has a responsibility to establish standards, develop institutions and pursue policies that protect its people from sexual violence, whether perpetrated by the Government's own forces or by others. That responsibility includes, as Special Representative Bangura just put it, redirecting the stigma from the survivors to the perpetrators.  That duty extends to men and boys, who have suffered sexual violence to an extent we have only recently begun to appreciate - in places like Colombia, where boys were turned into sex slaves by illegal armed groups; in Rutshuru, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which was under the savage control of the Mouvement du 23 mars for much of 2013; and in Libya, where the United Nations reported that armed brigades used rape in detention as a form of torture.  In far too many countries, the victims of sexual violence still have little, if any, effective legal recourse. Untilthat changes,predators willnotbe deterred, victims will hesitate to come forward and justice will remain beyond reach. In places where Governments are weak, we must help to improve their capabilities while also holding accountable those who commit crimes. Among the most culpable are the ruthless militias in the Central African Republic, whose assaults on civilians have almost literally torn the country apart, and where rape, forced marriage and sexual slavery are widespread; in Burma, where there are widespread reports of soldiers raping women and girls; and, as we have just heard, in South Sudan, where only this week militants have gone on the radio - radio, which my Rwandan colleague has called an evil multiplier - to incite the use of sexual violence against named ethnic groups; in Yemen, where child protection workers have attested to the abduction and abuse of boys by Ansar Al-Sharia. With all of that in mind, we should express special outrage at the continued and widespread incidence of sexual abuse practised by Syrian Government armed forces as part of the regime's ruthless campaign to terrorize civilians and drive families from their homes.  Despite chronic underreporting and difficulties of access, we know more about the nature and scope of the problem than ever before. The Secretary-General's report (S/2014/181), the information-collection mechanisms on which it is based, and the steadfast leadership shown by Special Representative Bangura are all welcome developments. In addressing sexual violence, the United Nations must set the right example in what it does both here in New York and in places around the world where tensions are high and United Nations peacekeepers or political missions are deployed. Ms. Bangura has shown determination in coordinating United Nations efforts across agencies in order to ensure that the imperative of putting a stop to sexual violence is addressed in training, included in mission mandates and reports, and becomes a central focus of enforcement activities and a major part of holding perpetrators accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.  As members of the Security Council, however, we must do our part by exercising proper oversight and pushing for the full implementation of the objectives we set, mission by mission. In that connection, I note that women protection advisers were deployed last year to Somalia and Mali, and are expected this year in the Sudan, South Sudan, Cote d'Ivoire and the Central African Republic. In Somalia, the United Nations has helped to train 12,000 police officers, and the Government has supported the increased recruitment of women police. An improved effort has also been made to strengthen investigative and prosecutorial capabilities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where sexual violence perpetrated by Government and rebel forces has long been a source of chronic and massive injustice.  We must also strive to help the Secretariat achieve its goal of 20 per cent female participation among United Nations police. But for that to happen, each of our countries must themselves increase their recruitment of women police into their domestic forces, so that there is a far broader pool on which the United Nations can draw. We must also insist on enforcing the absolute prohibition on sexual abuse by United Nations peacekeepers. Again, that requires that home countries hold perpetrators of sexual Violence accountable once they are sent home.  In conclusion, I would like to voice the strong support of my Government and of the American people for a concerted strategy across the globe to address the  problem of sexual violence, both in and outside combat situations. For far too long, such abuses have been treated as part of the spoils of victory or the rewards of physical might. Let us be clear: sexual abuse is among the worst of crimes, because it robs people of the precious and inalienable right to be secure in their bodies, and because it is inflicted out of cruelty. In our efforts to stop it, we have made gains in recent years, but we have a very long way to go.

UNSC_2014_SPV.7289_spch107.txt,2014,7289,"Mr. Tanin (Afghanistan): I thank you, Madam President, for organizing such an important meeting, and congratulations on your leadership of the Council this month. I would also like to thank previous speakers for their statements and the Secretary-General for his recent report (S/2014/693) on women and peace and security. I look forward to his global study of the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and the upcoming high-level review of the resolution.  This debate could not have come at a more timely moment. War and conflict affect more lives today - all over the world, but particularly in Afghanistan and the wider region - than at any time in recent history. Millions of families have been forced to flee their homes, and millions of women and children have been left vulnerable, bearing the brunt of the burden of those tragic circumstances.  The people of Afghanistan, particularly women and girls, have suffered immensely as a result of almost 40 years of war and conflict. The violence in my country has shattered their lives, interrupted their educations, threatened their livelihoods, destroyed their communities and pushed them from their homes to other countries or to unfamiliar cities and slums.  Afghanistan's refugee situation remains the largest protracted such situation in the world, and this year the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) has increased due to a resurgence of insecurity in parts of the country. Women suffer disproportionately in situations of displacement. They often lack access to the most basic services and resources and are at a higher risk of discrimination and human rights abuses.  In the past year, there has been a rise in the violent activities of the Taliban, terrorists groups and other anti-Government armed opposition and the greatest increase in civilian deaths ofthe past 13 years, including many of women and girls. The Taliban and other anti-Government elements continue to launch targeted attacks and intimidation campaigns against women from all spectrums of society, from schoolgirls to female leaders, including women police officers, human rights defenders, media personnel and politicians. Insecurity has also hampered the Government's ability to prosecute human rights abusers and uphold the rule of law, thereby exacerbating women's vulnerability to sexual and gender-based violence, domestic abuse, harassment, forced marriage and other crimes.  Despite those challenges, Afghanistan has arrived at an important turning point that offers tremendous opportunity for strengthened progress on the women and peace and security agenda. Last month, the new President was inaugurated, representing the first democratic transition from one elected president to the next in the country's history. In this year's presidential and provincial council elections, millions of women participated as voters, and hundreds played a significant role as candidates and as campaigners, despite facing threats and intimidation. Their involvement set the tone for an Afghanistan in which women participate and contribute equally to the country's future.  President Ghani Ahmadzai and the national unity Government are committed to women's full and equal participation at all levels of governance and decision-making. The President made that clear in his inaugural address, in which he pledged to promote women's advancement in Afghanistan and praised his wife, Rula Ghani, for the role she would play as an active public figure dedicated to promoting women's rights. This gesture is a first for our young democracy.  Just a few days ago, Afghanistan signed the women and peace and security national action plan, which aims to make progress on the four main areas ofparticipation, protection, conflict prevention and relief and recovery. We appreciate the Government of Finland's support for the development of the plan and remain committed to implementing the women and peace and security agenda through key institutions and the national action plan for the women of Afghanistan. We are also dedicated to promoting the participation of women in the security sector and aim to increase the number of women police officers from the current 2,230 to 10,000 by 2017.  As Afghanistan prepares for the full transfer of security responsibility from international to Afghan forces at the end of 2014, the President and new leadership of the country are committed to a comprehensive reform agenda. Over the next two years, Afghanistan will hold district and parliamentary elections, reform electoral laws, convene a loya jirga to consider amendments to the Constitution and conduct a reinvigorated outreach and reconciliation process with the armed opposition. Throughout, the active role of all segments of the Afghan population, particularly Afghan women, will be essential. The Government of Afghanistan believes adamantly that their participation is critical to preserving and enhancing the gains of the past 12 years and to the future stability, democracy, prosperity and peace of the country. In that regard, the international community's continued support for Afghanistan's efforts to advance women's rights and status remains crucial.  Afghan women have suffered immensely as a result of Taliban rule, extremism and decades of war. Only when they are free from violence, want and fear will we be able to secure stability and lasting peace in Afghanistan. For those reasons, we welcome the opportunities provided to us by the upcoming twentieth anniversary of the Beijing Conference on Women, the fifteenth anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000) and the adoption of the sustainable development goals to make further progress on the issue of women and peace and security, and the agenda for women in Afghanistan and for women around the world.

UNSC_2015_SPV.7374_spch123.txt,2015,7374,"Mr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): I would like very briefly to respond to the statement made by the representative of Ukraine.  Such attempts yet again to place all of the blame for what takes place in that country onto the Russian Federation come as a surprise to no one. Even the reports regarding the shelling by the Ukrainian army of residential areas, in violation of international humanitarian law - reports coming from a variety of sources, which cannot in any way be regarded as Russian propaganda - provoke no response from Kyiv other than yet further accusations against the Russian Federation. Quite clearly, our Lithuanian colleagues also take a selective attitude to such sources as well.  The reality is that on 13 April 2014, our delegation initiated the convening of an emergency meeting of the Security Council (see S/PV.7154) in order to attempt to prevent the Ukrainian authorities from using armed force in south-eastern Ukraine. We were unable to do so. The so-called anti-terrorist operation was launched, claiming civilian victims in its very first week. We have called again and again for an end to the violence and for the initiation of a full-fledged national dialogue that would avert further civilian casualties in Ukraine. Such an appeal was made to the authorities in Kyiv as recently as today by the Russian Foreign Ministry. Unfortunately, those calls have gone unheeded to date.  In conclusion, I recall that the topic of today's meeting is the protection of civilians. Nadiya Savchenko, a Ukrainian military officer, is not a civilian. However, the Russian journalists were definitely civilians, and she is accused of helping to kill them.  ",Mr. Zagaynov,Russian Federation,Russian,m," I would like very briefly to respond to the statement made by the representative of Ukraine.  Such attempts yet again to place all of the blame for what takes place in that country onto the Russian Federation come as a surprise to no one.

UNSC_2015_SPV.7428_spch043.txt,2015,7428,"Mr. Skoog (Sweden): I would like to thank you, Madam President, for your initiative in organizing today's debate.  I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway and my own country, Sweden.  First, I would like to thank the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Ms. Zainab Hawa Bangura, for her statement and for her activities and hard work. I would also like to thank Ms. Hamsatu Allamin for her participation in today's meeting. The role and influence of civil society in preventing conflict, building peace and promoting human rights is essential and it should be supported.  We warmly welcome the report of the Secretary- General (S/2015/203) and its concrete and specific recommendations on actions, and we commend Special Representative Bangura and her Office for their work in this regard. I would also like to commend the Team of  Experts on Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict in strengthening the capacities of States to address such violence, but despite rising recognition and attention to this issue, the picture is appalling. Nothing less than zero tolerance is acceptable in this area.  The fight to prevent and eradicate conflict-related sexual Violence must be pursued on several levels. These crimes do not emerge in a vacuum; they take place against a backdrop of structural, gender-based discrimination. Sexual violence is a reflection of gender inequalities. Therefore, a systematic and broad gender approach, which includes increasing women's empowerment through political participation and influence, strengthening women's economic rights and empowerment, promoting and protecting sexual and reproductive health and rights, improving women's and girls' security and furthering the education of women and girls, needs to be applied. These issues are fundamental. I would like to raise three more points. First, measures dealing with the consequences of sexual violence need to be stepped up. Assistance to survivors and witnesses, including sexual and reproductive health services and psychosocial, legal and livelihood support, is crucial, as was stressed by my Colombian colleague. It is urgent that we take further concrete steps to ensure accountability and end impunity, as many around this table have said today. We welcome and support the efforts of the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and the ongoing work of Justice Rapid Response and UN-Women for enhancing the capacity to investigate sexual and gender-based violent crimes which deny women and girls their human rights.  Secondly, there is a growing recognition that men should be involved to a larger extent in the work in favour of gender equality, as it cannot be left to women alone. There is a need to look at the impact of masculine identities on gender inequality, conflict and Violence. Evidence suggests that violent notions of masculinity not only perpetuate gender-based violence but can also fuel armed conflict, while more positive notions of masculinity could be instrumental in promoting peace.  Thirdly, we note the rise of violent extremism and terrorism, which are often built on perceptions that deny women their enjoyment of human rights. More attention on the human rights of women is therefore needed, particularly in the context of terrorism and counter-terrorism, especially with regard to the specific consequences of violent extremism on women's and girls' rights. Sexual violence and the denial of rights and freedoms, including the right to control their sexuality and reproduction, are integral to the ideology of extremist groups and used as part of a strategy to spread terror, persecute ethnic, religious and sexual minorities, and suppress whole communities that oppose these groups' ideology. It is clearly a tactic of terror and needs to be addressed in the international community's response. We therefore welcome the recommendation that efforts to prevent and address sexual violence and promote human rights of women should be closely and strategically aligned with efforts to prevent Violent extremism. Conflict-related sexual violence should be a topic fully integrated into the work of relevant Security Council sanctions committees.  Women protection advisers and gender advisers have a central role to play in ensuring competence and knowledge in order for United Nations missions to meet actual needs in the field. A11 missions should have a gender adviser with a sufficiently high level of authority and who should work directly with the mission leadership. Gender advisers, gender focal points and women protection advisers should be funded from the regular budget. Nevertheless, the ultimate responsibility to secure the gender dimension naturally lies with the leadership of the mission.  The Nordic countries are firm supporters, including financially, of United Nations Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict. We believe that United Nations Action makes the United Nations system work in a more holistic and coordinated way.  Lastly, the important role of media and civil society, including women's rights organizations, should not be underestimated. We need to draw on their knowledge and experience and recognize the pivotal role they play in changing social norms, attitudes and behaviours and help ensure that women's rights are upheld and that their voices are fully heard.

UNSC_2015_SPV.7533_spch030.txt,2015,7533,"Mr. Selim (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I would like to thank the Kingdom of Spain and the President of the Government of Spain for taking the initiative to convene today's meeting on women and peace and security on the fifteenth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), and for inviting us to participate.  I would also like to thank the Secretary-General for his efforts to highlight this important issue, including in his most recent report on the resolution's implementation (S/2015/7l6), which particularly emphasizes the problem of resolving the crises facing us of the lack of financing and inequitable selectivity in allocating financial resources, as well as the direct links that the report highlights among development issues, including the importance of supporting countries' efforts to help their peoples achieve their aspirations and of protecting women in armed conflict and post-conflict situations. Egypt supports the Secretary-General's call to promote the role of women in its peacekeeping operations and its mediation and conflict-resolution efforts.  Our discussion of the issues related to resolution 1325 (2000) has touched on the lack of adequate attention to some of the chief problems it is aimed at, in particular the degree to which women suffer under foreign occupation, as well as the effects that can result from an overemphasis on the connection between international human rights law and international humanitarian law, which can weaken the systems available for providing protection in both peace and war through the politicization of positions on the various issues linked to the two types of law. Another is insufficient attention to the priorities of national sovereignty and respect for national legislation, along with a reliance on unofficial studies that may not be as precise in evaluating the progress made in achieving goals for women and peace and security.  Terrorism is a threat to peace and security, along with the armed conflicts that afflict many States and regions around the world. In most cases, in fact, it forms an integral part of every conflict. That is a threat our communities face, and the threat level has increased of late. It has affected States' abilities to carry out their aspirations in terms of development and prosperity. Although terrorism threatens the whole of society, women are the most vulnerable. That is a cause to which we will accord great interest as a non-permanent member of the Security Council.  Egypt accords great interest to issues of women and their role as a pivotal element in building and maintaining peace. That interest is based on Egypt's efforts in promoting the position of women in different areas. It goes hand in hand with Egypt's broader vision of the empowerment of women at all levels. Egypt has supported the goals and rationale of resolution 1325 (2000) since its adoption, back in 2000, given the importance of this and subsequent resolutions with respect to the cause of women in conflict and post- conflict situations. In that regard, Egypt's support has taken many forms at both the regional and international levels.  The National Council for Women of Egypt has worked out a national plan for follow-up and implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) in the framework of the active role played by women in the area of international conflict resolution. Egypt has become one of 17 African States to develop that kind of national plan. Over the last 15 years, since the adoption of the resolution, Egypt has held a number of activities on that issue. Two regional workshops were organized, jointly with the United Nations and the League of Arab States. Egypt has accorded special attention to issues of training and capacity-building. From 2013 to 2015, the Cairo Regional Centre for Training on Conflict- Resolution and Peacekeeping in Africa has held seven training courses, two courses for the training of trainers and a workshop, all dedicated to habilitating staff and to exchanging expertise on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), under the theme ""Inclusion of gender in peacekeeping and peace building"", to be complemented by the holding of five additional training courses in the same vein up to June 2016.  In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the call to convene this important meeting, in which we have been eager to participate in the framework of Egypt's support for the efforts of the United Nations, and the Security Council in particular, to promote the role and status of women. Egypt will also be sure to follow up on these issues regionally and internationally in the context of its efforts to achieve peace and security.

UNSC_2015_SPV.7585_spch010.txt,2015,7585,"Mr. Oyarzun Marchesi (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): If my voice sounds shaky, it is because I find it very difficult to speak in this Chamber after Nadia. The walk from my office to the Chamber today was a peaceful one. I am lucky not to live in a conflict situation. I am lucky not to know first-hand what human trafficking is. I am lucky not to know what sexual violence in conflict 1s.  The closest I have ever been to such situations was in March when the Secretary-General inaugurated the Permanent Memorial to Honour the Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade at the entrance of United Nations Headquarters. And I remember that at that event he said clearly that the monument should lead us not to forget the past but should above all make us look to the future - and to take a look at the present and at human trafficking, which is nothing less than the modern form of slavery.  I therefore would begin by urging all representatives and Members of the Organization to look at the Memorial every time we enter United Nations Headquarters, and to think of people such as Nadia who have not had the life the rest of us have had and use all the tools we have within our reach to fight with greater steadfastness against human trafficking and sexual violence in conflict.  I believe the presidential statement adopted today (S/PRST/2015/25) is a good step in the right direction but it is certainly not enough. And I congratulate the Permanent Representative of the United States for having awakened our consciences this afternoon to the phenomenon of trafficking, which is something of which we should really be ashamed. It is probably one of the most deplorable phenomena currently being experienced by humankind.  I would like to share two preliminary observations with the Council, before attempting to propose some additional measures to fight effectively against human trafficking. My first observation is that sexual violence strategically exercised by Daesh and other terrorist groups can considerably increase the likelihood that women and girls will be trafficked. I would like to reiterate the words of the President of the Spanish Government, who said a few weeks ago that it is more dangerous to be a woman in armed conflicts than to be a soldier. That is a very sobering remark.  My second observation is that it is unacceptable for trafficking in women and children to be a part of the political economy, or worse, the financial economy, of terrorist groups. We must fight against this phenomenon in an absolute and across-the-board manner.  Further, I would refer to two errors that we simply should not make. The first is believing that the phenomenon is limited only to Daesh; it is not limited to Daesh, as the Deputy Secretary-General also said. Let us keep in mind the 276 girls kidnapped from the secondary school in Chibok. I think it is important not to lose sight of that fact. The second is that human trafficking is not a phenomenon exclusively linked to terrorism. Rather, it is a phenomenon that is also linked to the major conflicts we are experiencing today and the huge number of refugees in the world. Refugees and displaced persons give rise to making trafficking a phenomenon that is easier to practice.  Turning now to the United Nations, I believe that, although the existing legal architecture was inadequate to help Nadia, and I completely understand that it was, we need to begin by implementing it much more effectively, in particular the Palermo Protocol and other instruments. I can say with pride that my country, Spain, recently approved a comprehensive plan of action to fight trafficking in women and children for the years 2015-2018, in order to ensure that there is no recurrence of cases such as Nadia's.  Secondly, in strengthening the role of United Nations and the Security Council in fighing human trafficking, we must think about incorporating in the mandates of sanctions committees such serious and humbling subjects for humankind as the trafficking in persons.  I would conclude by discussing the victims. Council members know that my country has been a standard-bearing country for defending the victims of terrorism. We organized an Arria Formula meeting of the Security Council at which, for the first time, victims of terrorism were able to express themselves. Today Ambassador Power made it possible for Nadia, a victim of trafficking, to bravely take the floor and tell her truth in the Security Council.  Finally, ifbeing a victim of terrorism is serious, one can imagine how much more serious it would be to be a victim of terrorism and trafficking at the same time. Accordingly, I would address Nadia personally and assure her that the delegation of Spain will continue to fight to keep experiences like hers from ever recurring. I hope that within a few years we will no longer need United Nations funds to help people whose lives have been as difficult as hers has been.

UNSC_2016_SPV.7643_spch010.txt,2016,7643,"Ms. Power (United States of America): On behalf of the United States, I should like sincerely to thank those countries that voted in favour of resolution 2272 (2016), which was adopted today. The resolution underscores the Security Council's responsibility - our responsibility - to address the scourge of sexual exploitation and abuse in United Nations peacekeeping, which has been allowed to persist for far too long. Impunity for such abuses clearly undermines our efforts to promote international peace and security. The resolution makes clear that it is our job to ensure that there is accountability when men, women and children are abused by the Blue Helmets whom the Council has sent to protect them.  The resolution signals the Security Council's strong support for the zero-tolerance policy of the United Nations and for the ongoing efforts by the Secretary- General to strengthen this institution's response, reporting and remedial measures to prevent and combat sexual exploitation and abuse among United Nations peacekeepers. The resolution underscores the fact that peacekeepers found guilty - not those accused, those found guilty - of committing sexual exploitation and abuse do not deserve to serve in United Nations peacekeeping missions, and sends a clear message to troop- and police-contributing countries that fail to take action to prevent or punish credible allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation, as well as to all States Members of the United Nations and to United Nations bodies, to ensure that these investigations are carried out thoroughly, promptly and impartially.  I should also like to echo my French colleague's comment that the colour of the helmet means little to the victim. All of us, wherever we serve, whether we wear a blue or a green or some other colour helmet, have a responsibility to live up to the standards that this resolution tries to enshrine. All of us have a responsibility with respect to individuals who serve us overseas, in the same way that we have a responsibility within our own borders to ensure that these kinds of crimes are never carried out and that when they are carried out the perpetrators are held accountable.  The resolution adopted today endorses the decision of the Secretary-General to repatriate United Nations peacekeeping units that demonstrate widespread or systemic sexual abuse and exploitation, and it requests that the Secretary-General repatriate all uniformed personnel from a contributing country in a given mission if that country fails to take appropriate steps to address credible allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse, fails to hold the perpetrators accountable or fails to inform the Secretary-General of the status of such efforts.  I should like, if I could, to respond to Egypt's intervention. We were accused, implicitly, politely, of having an ulterior motive. I confess that I do have an ulterior motive. My ulterior motive is actually, finally, to do something about a cancer: the cancer of sexual exploitation and abuse against people who trust the United Nations flag. They see a peacekeeper coming their way and they think, this is someone who is going to help me; they do not think, I have to run, this is someone who is going to rape me. That is not what they think. That is not what they should ever think; but that is what they are going to think, and that is with some of them do think, because there is not accountability for the crimes committed that is in any way commensurate with what appears to be the scale of this problem.  So that is my ulterior motive, I confess. Sue me. I also take note of the very important comment that Egypt made, of the admission that the measures contained in the resolution - measures requiring accountability - would not have been passed by the General Assembly. We agree; the General Assembly has been totally paralysed. There are countries within the negotiations that are going on as we speak that have tried to water down the recommendations that the Secretary-General has made. It would be one thing if we were succeeding, if the system was working. We come in here every day; we lament, we condemn. We condemn the abuse and we condemn the lack of accountability, and then we go to the General Assembly and some of us try to water down provisions to try to strengthen the system. What is up with that? One cannot simultaneously try to water something down in the General Assembly and then complain when the body that sends peacekeepers out to try to protect people actually takes responsibility for the fact that some of those who were supposed to do the protecting are committing sexual abuse. We cannot have it both ways.  If the General Assembly had been able to actually put in place methods for accountability, if the system were working for girls like the ones Matthew just quoted, who are now left with the children of the people who have come and raped them and then gone back to their countries never having been held accountable - if the system had prevented these kinds of acts, or least had some kind of accountability, we would not be having this conversation. We are here only because it just keeps happening. So I think that it is very, very strange to hear Member States call on the one hand for more aggressive action or more accountability and then try to punt the issue to a body that for years has been unable to come to a consensus; and with several countries, again including countries on the Council, trying to water down what happens in the General Assembly, no reasonable person could expect a different result.  Let me conclude with two messages. To the tens of thousands of troops and police who serve honourably in United Nations peacekeeping operations, we salute them unequivocally for putting their lives on the line, with little fanfare or recognition, for people who live in countries far from their own. We and the civilians that they protect with their bravery are completely indebted to them for their service. As I did yesterday (see S/PV.7642), I would single out those members of the Council that have contributed so many peacekeepers, including Egypt, Senegal, China, Uruguay and, of course, the United Kingdom, which is becoming involved again. As a country that does not contribute a lot of troops, we are in awe of their service. To the victims of sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations peacekeepers, we pledge that we will do better. We will do better to ensure that the Blue Helmets we send as their protectors will not become perpetrators. That is what we are striving for. But if they do, this resolution demands that we, the Council, ensure that the people who commit such violations, who violate the good name of the United Nations and the good names of their countries, be held accountable.  ",Ms. Power,United States of America,English,f," On behalf of the United States, I should like sincerely to thank those countries that voted in favour of resolution 2272 (2016), which was adopted today. The resolution underscores the Security Council's responsibility - our responsibility - to address the scourge of sexual exploitation and abuse in United Nations peacekeeping, which has been allowed to persist for far too long. Impunity for such abuses clearly undermines our efforts to promote international peace and security. The resolution makes clear that it is our job to ensure that there is accountability when men, women and children are abused by the Blue Helmets whom the Council has sent to protect them.

UNSC_2016_SPV.7847_spch004.txt,2016,7847,"Mr. Fedotov: Several tragedies took place yesterday: the cowardly assassination of the Russian Ambassador to Turkey and the despicable terrorist attack in Berlin. May I express, on behalf of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), my deepest condolences to the Governments of the Russian Federation and Germany and to the families of the victims. As the UNODC mandate includes counter- terrorism, we stand ready to increase our support to Member States to strengthen international solidarity and cooperation in fighting the scourge of terrorism and hatred.  Turning to the agenda item under consideration, allow me to begin by expressing my gratitude to the Security Council for its attention to this urgent issue. Indeed, this is a historic meeting of the Security Council, as the Council is set to adopt, for the first time in its history, an action-oriented resolution dedicated to human trafficking. I would also like to thank UNODC Goodwill Ambassador Nadia Murad for helping to raise awareness of the plight of trafficking victims.  Thanks to these efforts, heightened attention is being given to the problem of human trafficking in conflict and mass movements of refugees and migrants, where we have seen this terrible crime acquire ever more appalling dimensions.  In seeking to strengthen international responses, we must keep in sharp focus the fact that human trafficking is pervasive. It is transnational, and its victims are everywhere. Trafficking victims have been detected in 106 countries and territories around the world.  Building effective action thus requires a strong framework of international cooperation and shared responsibility. I deliberately use the word ""build"", as there is no single measure, no one step in any given part of the world that can address this problem alone.  The building blocks we need can be found in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. This international treaty, concluded more than a decade ago, is still young, but some 158 countries have now criminalized most forms of human trafficking in their domestic laws, in line with the Protocol. It is true that the full implementation of the Protocol's provisions has yet to be achieved. However, the Palermo Convention and the Protocol could serve as a platform for a vast collective response to many of the challenges raised by today's debate.  What we really need is to strengthen existing frameworks, which represent a solid foundation of international law and years of painstaking operational cooperation that we can build upon to act against modern-day slave traders, including in situations of conflict and wherever we find such activities taking place.  The report of the Secretary-General (S/2016/949) details the efforts of the United Nations system to support Member States in improving the implementation of this international law instrument.  Tomorrow UNODC will present its 2016 Global Report on Trafficking in Persons, which it is mandated to do by the General Assembly and which provides a snapshot of the state of national responses to the challenges of human trafficking. The report, based on reliable data and information provided by Member States, establishes that an increasing number of trafficking victims from conflict-affected countries such as Syria, Iraq and Somalia have been detected in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. The report also features a thematic chapter on the connections between conflict, migration and trafficking. I hope that all present will join us tomorrow at the launch.  Looking ahead, I would like to highlight the urgent need for countries to improve identification and referral processes tailored to the challenges of conflict zones and mass movements.  UNODC is helping countries to enhance the identification and protection of trafficking victims among refugees and displaced persons fleeing conflict in the Middle East and Africa, and we hope to expand this work in future. At the same time, strategic law- enforcement action must target upstream organized criminals through intelligence-sharing,joint operations, financial investigations and coordination within and across borders.  The full arsenal of tools that we have to disrupt organized crime networks and terrorist groups and to fight money laundering and counter-terrorism financing must be deployed. Criminals exploit weakness. Gaps in our responses abet impunity and leave defenceless people exposed. UNODC is committed to doing our part to support the Security Council, to integrate action against human trafficking, to promote justice and accountability, and to protect the victimized and vulnerable.

France associates itself with the statement to be delivered by the observer of the European Union.  The actions committed by Da'esh in the Middle East and by Boko Haram in Africa are a dramatic illustration of the links that exist today between threats to international peace and security and human trafficking. At the global level, trafficking in persons and trafficking in drugs and counterfeit currency are among the most profitable. Their annual profits are estimated at $32 billion. It is one of the most extensive forms of trafficking. Sexual exploitation, forced labour, servitude, kidnapping for forced prostitution, rape - the list of atrocities committed in armed conflict is, unfortunately, long. Deriving profits from human beings and considering them as merchandise, the traffickers, as well as consumers and users and the clients of sexual exploitation, clearly and brutally violate their victims' human rights and further stoke the causes of conflict.  The international community has invested heavily in this problem since the beginning of this century, but further efforts are needed in order to address the scourge of human trafficking. I therefore welcome the initiative of the United Kingdom during its presidency of the Security Council and thank that country for giving us this opportunity to have an exchange on this very important subject.  For France, the issue oftrafficking in human beings and slavery, especially that of women and children, is of major importance. The statistics are, unfortunately, well known, but we must constantly point them out: 80 per cent of the victims of trafficking are women and children. The challenges are also well known: the identification of victims is still in its infancy, and organized mechanisms for fighting this scourge vary greatly between countries. Despite progress since the entry into force of the Palermo Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, still too few prosecutions have been initiated in cases involving the crime of human trafficking. The victims themselves do not always assert their rights and very often are insufficiently protected. In that context, international cooperation must be stepped up so as to increase the geographic coverage of the legislation providing effective protection against networks and to improve international cooperation aimed at dismantling those networks. Prevention, protection and the fight against impunity are the three priorities of French diplomacy in the fight against trafficking in human beings.  Since human trafficking is now an integral part of the strategy of certain terrorist groups and it fuels transnational organized crime, the Security Council has a special responsibility in combating this scourge. The adoption of resolution 2331 (2016), last December, at the initiative of Spain, was a major step forward towards better addressing the link between trafficking in human beings, sexual violence and terrorism. France very much looks forward to the report to be prepared by the Secretary-General by the end of the year.  We have in place a robust international legal framework and appropriate tools, in particular the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its Protocols and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, which is doing sterling work in this field.  On International Women's Rights Day, the President of the French Republic also announced that France would propose an additional protocol to the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. That protocol would address violence against women in order to complement the existing international framework. But we must ensure that the obligations arising from that legal framework are effectively implemented. Our words must now be translated into action.

UNSC_2017_SPV.7938_spch066.txt,2017,7938,"Mr. Pedersen (Norway): I am delivering this statement on behalf of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Sweden and my own country, Norway.  The persisting impunity for perpetrators of sexual violence is intolerable. The numbing stigma must be dealt with. When people flee to safety, we should make it our priority to ensure that they are not exposed to new abuse. The problem of sexual violence must be addressed in ceasefire agreements. It must be on the table in peace negotiations, part of our analysis in humanitarian efforts and at the forefront in our peacekeeping operations.  We must deal with inconsistencies. Rape is often treated as a burden that the woman must bear by herself, while a gun wound is a matter of national security. Yet sexual violence undermines the societies that we are striving to stabilize and rebuild. It destroys the future, as well as the present, for many more than those directly affected. That fact should serve to mobilize our whole peace and security architecture. If we are serious about sustaining peace, we must ensure that prevention is not just a priority but the main priority. And when we have been unable to prevent abuse, our approach must be focused on those who have suffered the crime. We must fight the stigma, investigate and prosecute.  Our response to conflict-related sexual violence must be firm and all-encompassing. Impunity is unacceptable, and perpetrators must be held accountable. The International Criminal Court plays a central role at the international level in the fight against impunity, but the capacities of national authorities must also be strengthened. States have a primary duty to prevent, investigate and prosecute sexual violence.  We value the work of the United Nations Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict and the unique capacity of Justice Rapid Response, in cooperation with UN-Women, which provide the needed expertise for investigating sexual and gender-based violence. We support the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-based Violence in Emergencies, led by Sweden, and appreciate the work of civil society, which remains key.  Also, United Nations peacekeeping operations must have the capacity to prevent and respond to conflict-related sexual violence and other human rights violations in communities where they operate. Female peacekeepers play an especially crucial role, and increasing the number of women serving in peace operations is therefore also vital from that perspective. We deploy many women police and are striving to increase the number of women in our military contingents, because we want the best, irrespective of gender. A diverse team delivers better. We train our military and police personnel before deployment and in-mission on sexual and gender-based violence, and support the African Union and African countries in their efforts in this area.  The Nordic Centre for Gender in Military Operations is a resource, as is Sweden's handbook for gender mainstreaming in operations. In cooperation with key partners, Norway recently started to develop a handbook for military staff in United Nations operations on preventing and responding to sexual violence in conflict. We thank the Secretary-General for his leadership in working to ensure that the zero- tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse in United Nations peacekeeping operations, and we hope it will become a reality. The Nordic network of women mediators is evolving, and more such networks are forming. We must draw on their experience and competence.  The need for gender competence and inter-regional exchange is growing as people are on the move and facing new vulnerabilities as they seek new opportunities. It should spur us all to act more strategically and forcefully.

Yet sexual violence undermines the societies that we are striving to stabilize and rebuild. It destroys the future, as well as the present, for many more than those directly affected. That fact should serve to mobilize our whole peace and security architecture. If we are serious about sustaining peace, we must ensure that prevention is not just a priority but the main priority. And when we have been unable to prevent abuse, our approach must be focused on those who have suffered the crime. We must fight the stigma, investigate and prosecute.  Our response to conflict-related sexual violence must be firm and all-encompassing. Impunity is unacceptable, and perpetrators must be held accountable. The International Criminal Court plays a central role at the international level in the fight against impunity, but the capacities of national authorities must also be strengthened. States have a primary duty to prevent, investigate and prosecute sexual violence.  We value the work of the United Nations Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict and the unique capacity of Justice Rapid Response, in cooperation with UN-Women, which provide the needed expertise for investigating sexual and gender-based violence. We support the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-based Violence in Emergencies, led by Sweden, and appreciate the work of civil society, which remains key.  Also, United Nations peacekeeping operations must have the capacity to prevent and respond to conflict-related sexual violence and other human rights violations in communities where they operate. Female peacekeepers play an especially crucial role, and increasing the number of women serving in peace operations is therefore also vital from that perspective. We deploy many women police and are striving to increase the number of women in our military contingents, because we want the best, irrespective of gender. A diverse team delivers better. We train our military and police personnel before deployment and in-mission on sexual and gender-based violence, and support the African Union and African countries in their efforts in this area.  The Nordic Centre for Gender in Military Operations is a resource, as is Sweden's handbook for gender mainstreaming in operations. In cooperation with key partners, Norway recently started to develop a handbook for military staff in United Nations operations on preventing and responding to sexual violence in conflict. We thank the Secretary-General for his leadership in working to ensure that the zero- tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse in United Nations peacekeeping operations, and we hope it will become a reality. The Nordic network of women mediators is evolving, and more such networks are forming. We must draw on their experience and competence.  The need for gender competence and inter-regional exchange is growing as people are on the move and facing new vulnerabilities as they seek new opportunities. It should spur us all to act more strategically and forcefully.

We extend special greetings to the civil society representative from our region.  Chile aligns itself with the statements delivered by the representatives of Canada, on behalf of the Group of Friends of Women, Peace and Security, and of Panama, on behalf of the Human Security Network.  We welcome the report of the Secretary-General (S/2017/861) and express our support for the initiatives related to the voluntary compact to end sexual exploitation and abuse, which Chile has signed, the appointment of the victims' rights advocate, the Senior Women Talent Pipeline initiative, and the strategy for the equal participation of men and women in the Organization.  Chile was a Latin American pioneer in developing an action plan for the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) in 2009, under the administration of President Bachelet, conscious of the important role played by women as agents of change and forgers of peace. The second national action plan is now in full implementation, with a strong emphasis on education and staff training.  The new plan includes the recommendations of the Security Council and international best practices in that area, making strides in creating indicators to measure progress on specific objectives that facilitate and promote women's access within peace operations at all levels of action and decision. We have incorporated a gender perspective in doctrine, planning and carrying out of Chile's peace operations in all four thematic areas and goals established by the United Nations: prevention, participation, protection and relief, and recovery. Chile co-sponsored resolution 2242 (2015), promoted by Spain, and is a founding member of the Women, Peace and Security National Focal Points Network. The Network's last meeting in September reaffirmed its commitment to continuing to support and develop women's participation in decision-making in all areas.  Equal opportunity and the empowerment of women has been a key pillar of our Government's gender agenda, which has made solid progress such as the incorporation of gender equality in electoral reform, and which requires that at least 40 per cent of candidates running for Congress be women. At the international level, we promote and protect women's rights in armed conflict, especially given the need to increase women's participation in decision-making related to international peace and security. That is how we bolster women's presence in peace missions both in Haiti and in Colombia's special political mission. In the field of prevention, we are developing academic initiatives based on the women and peace and security agenda, incentivizing the inclusion of a gender perspective in sustaining peace activities.  The inclusion of women in peace operations raises awareness about women's and children's issues on the ground in such operations, and their presence has helped prevent sexual exploitation and abuse. In that context, women both in peace operations and within communities have played a central role in sustaining peace and protecting women's rights. We echo the sentiments of previous speakers in affirming that one of the greatest challenges we face is increasing the participation of women in peace operations and, in particular, ensuring the presence of gender advisers in such operations.

UNSC_2018_SPV.8234_spch045.txt,2018,8234,"Mr. Jfirgenson (Estonia): Ithankyou, Mr. President, for convening today's meeting on this vital topic. We were impressed by the comprehensive statements by Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, Special Representative Pramila Patten and Ms. Razia Sultana.  Estonia aligns itself with the statement delivered earlier by the observer of the European Union and reiterates its commitment to fighting gender-based violence, including sexual violence.  Sexual violence is among the gravest violations of human rights. Its impact ranges from immediate to multiple long-term physical and mental consequences for women and girls, men and boys. It also has very negative consequences for their families, communities, societies and countries as a whole. But it is not inevitable. There are ways to prevent it. We fully support the Secretary- General's recommendation in his latest report (S/2018/250) to give due consideration to early-warning signs of sexual violence when monitoring conflict situations. If we fail to act early, the human, political and economic costs can be devastating, as we know all too well. That calls for a more alert, coordinated and comprehensive approach by States Members and the United Nations system.  It is crucial to support survivors of sexual violence with adequate services so that they can rebuild their lives. Survivors should also always be given the option of documenting their cases for future accountability processes. In that regard, the role of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in ensuring the effective investigation and prosecution of sexual and gender- based crimes cannot be emphasized enough. The work of UN-Women and Justice Rapid Response is also important, since its joint expert roster has been an effective tool for deploying experts to investigate and document sexual violence in conflict-driven zones. Estonia is fully committed to tackling gender- based violence and has put in place a comprehensive development strategy for the period from 2015 to 2020 for reducing violence domestically. It lays out concrete activities for reducing and preventing violence in its various forms, including sexual violence. Globally, Estonia has been a strong supporter of Special Representative Pramila Patten and her mandate. We are also proud to be a consistent contributor to the ICC Trust Fund for Victims, which alleviates suffering for survivors of violence.  I would also like to emphasize the important role of civil society. While intergovernmental cooperation is extremely significant, we need to ensure that everyone is heard. Civil-society and non-governmental organizations, and women's organizations in particular, can provide new insight and data that could otherwise be missed. It is therefore very important to ensure that non-governmental organizations have larger platforms and more access to United Nations meetings and forums. That would unquestionably help us to ensure that every detail is accounted for in achieving our goals related to ending conflict-related sexual violence.  Our experience has shown that national action plans for implementing resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, are essential in raising awareness of the need for the inclusion of women in conflict prevention and sustainable peacebuilding. Estonia is currently implementing its second national action plan, which was created and is being implemented jointly with non-governmental organizations.  A fundamental lesson that we have learned from experience and from the Secretary-General's reports is the sheer level of detail that we have to deal with in addressing sexual violence in conflict-driven zones. Let us work together, domestically and globally, to put an end to sexual violence forever.

Peru is committed to the women and peace and security agenda. Together with Sweden, we have the honour of chairing the group of experts that promotes that agenda in the Council. As such, we fully support the statements of Minister Wallstrom of Sweden and Minister Brandt of the Netherlands, who today honour us with their presence. We would also like to commend the important briefings of the Secretary-General, the Executive Director of UN-Women and, on behalf of women's organizations, Ms. Randa Siniora Atallah.  Peru emphasizes the importance of women's participation and leadership in the maintenance of international peace and security and, in relation to that, the primary responsibility of national States in promoting their political and economic empowerment. Since 2000, the Council has adopted eight resolutions that have served to set an agenda and develop good practices in that area. Nevertheless, barriers and challenges persist, forcing us to redouble our efforts as we approach the commemoration in 2020 of the twentieth anniversary of the historic resolution 1325 (2000).  The evidence shows that when women participate more at every level of political life, societies are less inclined to conflict and more inclined to maintain and consolidate peace. Women bring perspectives on future and unity that are essential to building and sustaining peace. In that regard, we emphasize that gender equality and women's economic and political empowerment contribute to reducing their particular vulnerabilities during conflict and in general to preventing violence and advancing human resilience, as well as achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. An investment in women's empowerment is an investment in peace and development as well as in protecting and promoting their human rights. That is why we want to highlight and support the Secretary- General's vision and the priority he gives to developing and implementing this agenda, based on the concept of sustainable peace. With regard to the role of women in the maintenance of international peace and security, we underscore the Secretary-General's views on the need to promote their participation and leadership in every peace effort, starting with active collaboration with women's civil-society organizations. In that regard, we wan to emphasize the importance of contributing to financing the women's organizations that have been asked to participate in the peace processes launched by the Council.  We also underscore the importance of incorporating gender perspectives into peace operations mandated by the Council. In our View it is crucial to train Blue Helmets in promoting and protecting women's and children's human rights. In that regard, and in view of the provisions of resolution 1820 (2008), Peru has been gradually increasing women's participation in the armed forces we send to United Nations peacekeeping operations, and we have already surpassed the minimum 15 per cent required in the resolution.  Still with regard to the agenda on women and peace and security, our Ministry of Women and Vulnerable Populations has created a displaced persons registry that enables us to quickly recognize and address issues relating to the rights of women and girls who were affected during the years in which Peru was battling terrorism. Our Government has also committed to implementing policies aimed at empowering women in the political and economic life of the country, with a decentralized approach that includes the need to guarantee the election of women to positions of authority.  I would like to conclude by citing in this debate the voice of Flora Tristan, a Peruvian citizen who was one of the great nineteenth-century pioneers in the vindication of the rights of women:  ""All of the world's misfortunes stem from the oblivion and contempt in which the natural and essential rights of being a woman have been held until now"".

Many of the proposals deserve careful and detailed study, and we believe that today's debate is a good opportunity for an open exchange of views on that.

The central focus of her efforts should be situations of armed conflict, and specifically those where sexual Violence is widespread.

It is also important not to underestimate the significance of maintaining a united approach to understanding the scope of the Security Council's mandate on combating sexual violence in conflict and of refraining from attempts to broaden its interpretation and take the Council beyond its remit of maintaining international peace and security.

UNSC_2019_SPV.8649_spch008.txt,2019,8649,"The Secretary-General: The women and peace and security agenda is clearly one of the top priorities of the United Nations as a whole. We see that in the adoption of a great many resolutions by the Security Council, including landmark resolution 1325 (2000) and its many follow-up decisions. We see it in the global recognition of the central role that women must play in preventing and resolving conflicts. And we see it when we gather to discuss the issue. That is always when the Chamber is at its fullest and the list of speakers is the longest. We have exactly that same situation today.  Given such strong support and common understanding, an observer might be forgiven for thinking that things are substantially improving. But the sad fact is - and we must be blunt about it - that the commitment that is always reflected around this table is not translating into real change around the world. It is not coming fast enough or far enough. Change is coming at a pace that is too slow for the women and girls whose lives depend on it, and for the effectiveness of our efforts to maintain international peace and security.  Nearly two decades after resolution 1325 (2000) was adopted, women still face exclusion from many peace and political processes. Peace agreements are adopted without provisions that consider the needs and priorities of women and girls. A pitifully small 0.2 per cent of bilateral aid to fragile and conflict-affected situations goes to women's organizations. The number of attacks against women human rights defenders, humanitarians and peacebuilders continues to increase. Sexual and gender-based violence continues to be used as a weapon of war, with the survivors of such violence often left without justice or support. This year alone, millions of women and girls were in need of life-saving sexual and reproductive health services, and millions more required interventions to prevent sexual and gender-based violence. There is also a growing number of armed groups for which gender inequality is a strategic objective, and misogyny part of their core ideology. And, of course, we know that women and girls continue to suffer the consequences of conflict in general. To cite just one example, in north-east Syria, we saw thousands of women and children fleeing the latest violence. But despite this grim litany, we will not give up. This, for me, is an absolute priority.  We can report at least some progress. In Yemen, where women were absent from the formal rounds of consultations, my Special Envoy established a Yemeni women's technical advisory group to ensure that the perspectives of Yemeni women are included. In Guinea-Bissau, women played a direct role in breaking the political impasse last year, supported by the Peacebuilding Fund. They led unprecedented mobilization for parity laws requiring a minimum of 36 per cent of women on the ballot, and they were key to the success of the elections this year. There were record numbers of women candidates and voters, and the country achieved parity among ministerial posts. In Syria, women make up approximately 30 per cent ofthe new Constitutional Committee, including some from the Women's Advisory Board that has been working for peace all these years.  Within the United Nations itself, the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and the Department of Peace Operations are implementing a new and stronger policy on women and peace and security. All heads of special political missions and my Special Envoys have  been instructed to report regularly on their efforts to promote women's direct participation throughout all stages of peace processes, in ways that ensure they have influence over the outcomes. An objective related to women and peace and security has now been included in all senior managers' compacts related to peace and security mandates. In our peacekeeping operations, we are working to end sexual exploitation and abuse and increase women's participation. Incidents of sexual exploitation and abuse have been reduced by half, and we are finally moving the needle on the percentage of women in the military and the police components of our operations. I have appointed many more women as heads and deputy heads of missions, and we are pursuing emergency measures to achieve gender balance.  Women and peace and security is one of the eight priority pillars of our Action for Peacekeeping initiative, endorsed now by more than 150 countries. I have also requested peacekeeping and special political missions to improve their monitoring and reporting of threats and violence against activists, including women human rights defenders, and for that to be built into early warning signs of escalating conflict or instability. Without a gender analysis, we are operating on partial information and are unable to anticipate and respond effectively to early warnings.  Today we recognize both progress and how much more we must do. When we fall short, women, girls and all members of society suffer the consequences. A failure to act on women's rights and the principles of the women and peace and security agenda bring about enormous costs. Let us work together to change the narrative and improve, through implementation, the situation on the ground.  ",The Secretary-General,,English,u," The women and peace and security agenda is clearly one of the top priorities of the United Nations as a whole. We see that in the adoption of a great many resolutions by the Security Council, including landmark resolution 1325 (2000) and its many follow-up decisions. We see it in the global recognition of the central role that women must play in preventing and resolving conflicts. And we see it when we gather to discuss the issue. That is always when the Chamber is at its fullest and the list of speakers is the longest. We have exactly that same situation today.  Given such strong support and common understanding, an observer might be forgiven for thinking that things are substantially improving. But the sad fact is - and we must be blunt about it - that the commitment that is always reflected around this table is not translating into real change around the world. It is not coming fast enough or far enough. Change is coming at a pace that is too slow for the women and girls whose lives depend on it, and for the effectiveness of our efforts to maintain international peace and security.  Nearly two decades after resolution 1325 (2000) was adopted, women still face exclusion from many peace and political processes. Peace agreements are adopted without provisions that consider the needs and priorities of women and girls. A pitifully small 0.2 per cent of bilateral aid to fragile and conflict-affected situations goes to women's organizations. The number of attacks against women human rights defenders, humanitarians and peacebuilders continues to increase. Sexual and gender-based violence continues to be used as a weapon of war, with the survivors of such violence often left without justice or support. This year alone, millions of women and girls were in need of life-saving sexual and reproductive health services, and millions more required interventions to prevent sexual and gender-based violence.

UNSC_2019_SPV.8657_spch018.txt,2019,8657,"Mr. Esono Mbengono (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in Spanish): At the outset, I would like to congratulate South Africa on its successful presidency in October and on the Council's adoption of resolution 2439 (2019), on women and peace and security. We wish the delegation of the United Kingdom a productive presidency and would like to assure it of Equatorial Guinea's steadfast collaboration and support. My thanks also go to the two briefers, my sisters Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed and Ms. Fatima Kyari Mohammed, for their informative statements.  We join others in commemorating the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the mandate of the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary General on Conflict-Related Sexual Violence. Our Government will continue to support the various elements of the United Nations architecture aimed at combating sexual violence in armed conflicts, the promotion of women's rights and the inclusion of women in decision-making processes.  The Republic of Equatorial Guinea believes that the enhanced cooperation between the Security Council and the African Union's African Peace and Security Architecture, which also strengthens subregional initiatives in the implementation of Council resolutions to advance the women and peace and security agenda, among other things, is an example of the type of alliance that should continue to be supported in a more predictable manner. In that regard, we would like to highlight the high-level visits led by the Deputy Secretary-General to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria in 2017, the Niger, the Sahel, South Sudan and Afghanistan in 2018, and to Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia and Eritrea this year, not forgetting the visit to Cameroon in April. I would also like to acknowledge the dedication of the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict to mainstreaming this agenda, while also encouraging the strategic initiatives within the Joint United Nations-African Union Framework for Enhanced Partnership in Peace and Security concerning the prevention of and response to conflict-related sexual violence in Africa, bolstered by the support of UN-Women, the African Women Leaders Network and FemWise-Africa.  The strategic importance of the Horn of Africa and the generally positive evolution of events in the region made ajoint visit of the United Nations and the African Union more than necessary. These visits are becoming something of a tradition for the two institutions, which complement one another in the quest for solutions to issues affecting life on the African continent. Equatorial Guinea has always applauded the cooperation between the two organizations in Africa, given that their partnership is a valid formula that is bound to have positive results. The promotion of the women and peace and security agenda must continue to be united in its criteria and actions with a View to making more room for women at the negotiating and decision-making tables and benefiting from their unique perspective. Only in this way, and with the support of subregional institutions such as the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, will it be possible to make progress in terms of conflict resolution and peacebuilding in the subregion and throughout the continent.  The participation of women in the quest for solutions to the problems affecting the region should be encouraged. Women, together with young people, must be at the heart of those efforts in order to forge sustainable peace and development and seek out lasting solutions in a context of humanitarian crisis. And women must always play a principal role in post- conflict situations.
