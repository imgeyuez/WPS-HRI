[
    " Mr. President, I would like to begin by offering my delegation's thanks to you for organizing this open debate on the important issue of \"Women and peace and security\". Recalling last June's twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, entitled \"Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century,\" my delegation welcomes today's meeting as a timely effort to build on the outcome of the special session.  Although the threat of an armed conflict at the global level has continued to diminish since the end of the cold war, rampaging armed conflicts at the regional, national and local levels have increased, posing challenges to international peace and security. Though armed conflicts affect both women and men, the current patterns of conflicts make women and girls particularly vulnerable to numerous threats because of their status in society and their gender. In most cases, casualties among combatants are outnumbered by civilian deaths, mostly women and children. Increasingly, parties to a conflict even engage in deliberate violence against women as a strategy of war and terrorism. The fear of such violence has created a mass flow of refugees and displaced persons, the majority of whom are women, adolescent girls and children.  Fortunately, there have been important developments in the treatment of violence against women in armed conflict. We welcome the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which took gender concerns into account when defining genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression. This Statute validates our agreement that no impunity is to be granted for the perpetrators of specific gender-related crimes.  I also appreciate the work of relevant United Nations agencies, such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Development Fund for Women and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for their coordinated and dedicated efforts. Nor should we forget the contributions of non-governmental organizations in raising awareness about the situation of women and girls in armed conflicts and in assisting them.  Despite the progress that has been made so far, much remains to be done to ensure gender-sensitive justice, to address the specific needs of women affected by armed conflicts and to increase the participation of women in peacekeeping, peace-building and reconciliation processes.  The relative absence of women in decision- making processes with regard to armed conflicts is also a cause for concern. My delegation shares the view of the Security Council that peace is inextricably linked with equality between women and men, and that women should play an equal part in maintaining peace and security. We urge the Security Council to continue to expand its involvement in this issue.  Having said that, I should now like to make a few points which in our View deserve the urgent attention and action of the international community. First of all, we must ensure, without further delay, the full participation of women at all levels of decision-making and implementation in peacekeeping and peace- building. We encourage gender balance in peace negotiations and in the appointment of special envoys and representatives of the Secretary-General. We also encourage States participating in peace negotiations to include women representatives, in order to reflect the special needs of women and girls.  Secondly, my delegation believes that United Nations peacekeeping operations should pay more attention to gender mainstreaming in their work. With the expansion of the work of peacekeeping operations in political affairs, public information, humanitarian assistance and refugee return, among other areas, the role of peacekeeping personnel in meeting women's and girls' specific needs is also being enlarged. To ensure the effective work of protecting and promoting women's needs and rights, specialized gender training should be provided to all peacekeeping operation personnel. In this respect, my delegation welcomes the Secretariat's efforts to provide Member States with gender awareness guidelines and materials. In addition, the number of female personnel in peacekeeping operations, in particular those personnel addressing women's special needs, should be increased. The Republic of Korea, for its part, has included women officers in its peacekeeping operation missions and plans to expand their number in the future.  Thirdly, considering that women are more likely than men to be placed in refugee camps, we believe that women refugees and displaced women should be more involved in the design and management of humanitarian activities so that they can benefit from these activities as much as men do. To this end, we ask the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other relevant United Nations agencies to provide all women and girls in refugee camps with appropriate health care and education and to ensure their safety.  Without full gender equality and the advancement of women, we cannot achieve the world envisioned in the Charter of the United Nations. All Members should make the utmost effort and fully cooperate with the relevant United Nations agencies to effectively protect women and girls in armed conflict, redress Violations of their human rights and empower women as equal partners at every step of the process to achieve peace and security. My delegation wishes to reaffirm the strong commitment of the Republic of Korea to contribute to the efforts of the international community to this end.  ",
    " I have the honour to speak on behalf of the European Union. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe associated with the European Union - Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia- and the associated countries, Cyprus and Malta, align themselves with this statement.  Allow me to thank you, Sir, on behalf of the European Union, for having inscribed on our agenda the theme of women and peace and security. The Security Council's interest in the specific situation of women is recent. The Council paid tribute to their special role on 8 March 2000 on the occasion of International Women's Day, on the initiative of the President at the time, the Ambassador of Bangladesh. This debate logically follows from the interest accorded in the protection of civilians in armed conflict and the competence of the Council regarding peace and security.  Our work should not disregard those involved elsewhere in the United Nations. The question of women in conflict was one of the 12 action areas of the Beijing Platform for Action, and the follow-up special session of the General Assembly held in June 2000, which rightly included \"peace\" in its title, took up and strengthened the recommendations on this topic. The role of women in all situations, I have no doubt, will be taken into account by the Security Council.  My first comment is that when we deal with conflict the role of women seems to be basically passive. Women are generally mentioned only as victims. To the extent that it is civilians that suffer most from conflicts, women represent a high percentage of the victims. It is therefore important that peacekeeping forces be sensitized and trained to bear in mind in their missions women's specific protection needs. In recent years particular attention has been paid to the use of sexual violence as a method of warfare. These acts of aggression basically target women, who are sometimes the victims of systematic rape and gender-based acts of aggression. These acts must not go unpunished.  In this regard, the European Union is happy that the International Criminal Court describes as war crimes, and in specific circumstances crimes against humanity, acts of sexual violence committed in times of conflict. It appeals to all States to sign or ratify the Statute of the International Criminal Court and to incorporate its principles into their national legislation.  Women also constitute a high proportion of refugees and displaced persons, which makes them extremely vulnerable. The European Union is concerned about the development of trafficking in persons in conflict situations. We welcome the progress towards the adoption of the draft Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its protocols, particularly that relating to trafficking in persons. We appeal for the speedy conclusion of this work.  Ending violence is a twofold challenge: on the one hand, the duty to see justice done, and, on the other, the need for reconciliation. Women have often played a decisive role in this area, particularly in Africa - I am thinking of Burundi, for example- and Latin America. We all recall the example of the Plaza de Mayo grandmothers, who ensured that the memory of the disappeared would not sink into oblivion.  This example also shows us - and this brings me to my second comment - that women are not just victims in conflict situations; they can play an essential role in conflict resolution and in rebuilding. While still under-represented in decision-making positions, women have started to participate actively in conflict resolution, in peacekeeping, in defence and in foreign affairs. It is important to create the conditions in which more of them can become stakeholders.  Within the competent bodies of the United Nations, it is taken for granted that women must be able to be heard and to have access to decision-making positions. We must increasingly appoint women with the necessary experience and competence to the posts of special representatives or envoys. Here we have a reservoir of human resources that the United Nations does not use to the fullest.  The Brahimi report (S\/2000\/809) gives an opportunity for an in-depth discussion of integrated strategies for conflict prevention and peace-building. It would appear that the role of women has not been mainstreamed, including in the recommendations on the training of United Nations field staff. The new importance assigned to the civilian aspects of peacekeeping operations should enable women to participate more fully. A balanced composition of teams should be sought to allow women to use their widely recognized ability to make contact with local communities and share in the realities of their daily life. We hope that this question will be taken into consideration in the follow-up to this report.  In their own countries, women must be encouraged to participate in reconciliation and rebuilding; it is something they already do. We should also study ways to better involve civil society, particularly women's organizations, in areas vital to reconstruction, such as justice. It is also essential to maintain basic social services, particularly for women and children, in post-conflict situations.  Social cohesion, which is necessary to stabilize States emerging from conflict situations or threatened by them, is promoted by equality between men and women and respect for their rights. Rebuilding a country's democratic institutions and its political and public life must involve the participation of women in the decision-making process, because of the need for gender equality. In this regard, the European Union welcomes the initiatives taken by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and, within the Stability Pact for the Balkans, the establishment of a working group which has drawn up a plan of action for gender equality.  The European Union also stresses that this question figures prominently in the Declaration adopted at the Millennium Summit, which we must implement for the benefit of the peoples concerned.  ",
    " The representative of France will shortly be making a full statement on behalf of the European Union, which the United Kingdom supports. I will therefore limit myself to a few additional points.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the British Permanent Representative, has repeatedly said that a careful consideration of the needs and rights of ordinary people should be at the heart of the Security Council's activities on conflict. We need to remember that civilians, so often the tragic victims of conflict, are individuals in specific circumstances.  The human toll of conflict hits women and girls hardest. They are exploited and targeted, often deliberately, as a strategic weapon. They form the majority of refugee populations and of the internally displaced. And they continue to be at risk even after the conflict, as the international human rights and humanitarian standards that should guarantee their security are all too rarely implemented.  We cannot treat this situation purely as a symptom of conflict. It is also a cause. Because of women's unique position in the social fabric, these threats continue to damage the long-term prospects for peace and security. This is the challenge that the Security Council faces. Much of what needs to be done will have to be incorporated into our regular work, as we examine individual country situations. But let us use this debate, and the draft resolution that will eventually be adopted, as an opportunity to push forward the agenda. We need to focus on concrete deliverables in areas where we can really make a difference.  We should concentrate in particular on three themes.  First, how do we make sure that the rights and particular concerns of women and girls are properly considered and acted on in the Council's everyday work?  We need the right sort of information to know what the problem is and the right sort of analysis to make our judgements. This is particularly the case when considering concrete operational issues, such as disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes, where women and girls may have different needs from those of male combatants.  One way of doing this would be to encourage the Secretary-General to incorporate analysis on gender issues in his regular reporting to the Council on country-specific issues. The Brahimi report recommends that an information and strategic analysis secretariat be established to improve the United Nations capacity to gather and analyse information. We support this recommendation and hope that gender expertise will be incorporated in this secretariat.  Secondly, what can we do to mainstream gender within the objectives and organizational structure of peacekeeping operations? Where the Secretary-General has recommended that specific gender concerns should be addressed in peacekeeping mandates, we should incorporate them into the heart of our decisions. Gender expertise should be included in peacekeeping operations and their staff mandated and provided with the resources to address women's particular concerns. Peacekeeping operations should also work closely with non-governmental organizations and civil society on the ground in these areas.  We need to develop greater sensitivity to the impact of peacekeeping operations on local populations. At yesterday's Arria-format meeting, we heard some dreadful tales of abuses of women's rights committed by the peacekeepers that are meant to provide stability and protection. That is why the United Kingdom and Canada have jointly financed work, in collaboration with the Lester Pearson Peacekeeping Training Centre, to produce training materials on gender for peacekeepers. We hope that this work will be of use to as wide a spectrum of troop-contributing countries as possible. We also encourage the Secretary- General to provide training on the rights and particular needs of women and girls to civilian staff serving in peacekeeping operations. My third point is that we should not fall into the trap of seeing women and girls only as the victims of armed conflict. They can also play key roles in unlocking the door to peace. The full representation of women's groups at all levels of peace negotiations is vital to building sustainable peace and security. With this in mind, the United Kingdom is embarking on an ongoing programme of support for the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) to help it to build its capacity to act as a catalyst for women's participation in peace processes. This excellent programme will involve a review of activities by women's civil society and the development of an information repository and local field-based activities. We are proud to be able to help.  The United Kingdom is very pleased that Namibia has organized this timely debate today. We look forward to listening to the views of non-members, just as we welcomed the spirited discussion that took place with non-governmental organizations at yesterday's Arria-formula meeting. We particularly welcome the role of Angela King and of UNIFEM. in providing support and advice in this process. However, we should not forget that it is the responsibility of all those involved in peace and security to ensure that gender considerations are mainstreamed into United Nations activities.  The next step is to negotiate a resolution that makes a difference. We should focus it on the areas where results can be achieved and concentrate on delivering a step change in the way the Council addresses the special needs of women and girls. The United Kingdom stands ready to play its full part in driving this important agenda forward.  ",
    " We are very pleased to see you, Sir, presiding over the Council. The subject chosen for this debate is important to me as a woman and as a politician whose interests lie in foreign policy and security issues. We thank you for very thoughtfully sending around to your colleagues a folder of background reading which contains suggestions, presumably made by the Secretariat, for Council action.  In addressing a subject that is vast and complex, I will limit myself, as I hope the Council will, to those areas which are properly within its mandate: the impact on women when peace breaks down, and their role in conflict and its resolution.  The first point of concern must be that women bear a disproportionately large share of the burden of conflict, but have a marginal say in matters of war and peace. That is perhaps a function of the gender imbalance in our societies, which is reflected in positions of power and influence. On International Women's Day this year, the President of the Council issued a statement affirming that the equal access and full participation of women in power structures and their full involvement in all efforts for the prevention and resolution of conflict were essential for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security. I thank the Council for those sentiments, but, looking around this table, I should also like to say that a Security Council dominated by men illustrates the problem, not the solution.  The second point is, of course, where the equality of the sexes - which we believe is a necessity - will lead us. Women form such a large proportion of the casualties of modern war because throughout the last century military doctrines no longer distinguished between combatants and civilians. From the Second World War onwards, civilians became preferred targets both because they were more vulnerable and because it was believed that the national will had to be broken to win a total war. Paradoxically, women became the favoured victims of modern war because they were not combatants.  Does the answer lie, therefore, in giving women the dubious right to fight alongside their menfolk in modern armies? Throughout history, women have taken up arms when the need has been desperate. The Rani of Jhansi led our first War of Independence in 1857, and died fighting. Kaipkire of the Herero led her people in battles against European slave traders. Those, however, and others like them, were women who took up arms to fight against injustice. We need to consider the impact on our societies, and on their tendency to war, if women become part of and glorify the military culture. Who should women take as their model - Lysistrata, using her femininity to force men from war, or the Amazon, joining and beating men at their own bloody game? A generation ago, two psychologists, Eleanor Maccoby and Carol Jacklin, established that while certain gender stereotypes could not be proved, one could: men were the more aggressive sex. In every culture, the organized violence of war and conflict has been a male preserve. That is a steel purdah in which we can leave our men.  There is also the question of the technology of war. Until the two world wars, weapons were heavy and hard to use, designed for soldiers who had to meet minimum physical standards and be trained in their use. In total war, weapons had to be designed for conscripts who were not fit and had little or no training; they became light and simple to use. As Graga Machel pointed out in her study on children and armed conflict, light automatic weapons were what made it easy and tempting to use child soldiers. If women become a significant percentage of armies, it is a foregone conclusion that weapons will be adapted even more to suit them, and what is light enough for a woman to use is also very well suited for a young boy or girl. These new weapons will make for even more indiscriminate use and could very well increase the use of children in conflict.  These are not academic points, because in the Western societies whose norms tend to dominate thinking at the United Nations, women are now increasingly permitted by law to go into combat. At the United Nations, including in this Council, there are repeated calls for a gender balance in the composition of peacekeeping forces, which, as the Brahimi report, prepared by a Panel dominated by men, has pointed out, increasingly go into situations where robust military action might be needed. Is it in the interest either of women or of peace, or of gender equality, for women to embroil themselves in conflict, even if it is in the cause of the United Nations? We have problems enough with the feminization of poverty; we need not feminize Violence. It would be much better, surely, if women had a larger and more visible role in helping the United Nations to resolve conflicts, for instance, as special representatives of the Secretary-General. This the Council can and should encourage.  I want to make one more point about peacekeeping practices. The Council has decided that AIDS is a threat to security, and peacekeepers must all be issued contraceptives by the United Nations. Unfortunately, as the United Nations knows, to its cost, a large number of the troops it fields are poorly trained; others, in the 1990s, trafficked in women. Blue Helmets might very well now believe that if the United Nations is giving them contraceptives, they are expected to use them. AIDS has never been a problem in any United Nations peacekeeping operation; the exploitation of women unfortunately has. The Council's decision could make this worse.  Feminist lawyers argue that human rights law and international humanitarian law do not offer enough protection to women. This is a bit extreme; women's rights and needs have received the attention they deserve in the codification of international law. I do agree that there are loopholes even in the much stronger walls of legal protection that have been raised over the last 50 years, and these must be closed. However, insofar as these are treaty-based protections, action must be taken within the terms of these treaties, and by the States parties. Otherwise, in seeking to strengthen law, we would be undermining it. Therefore, unless there are treaties that give the Security Council a role in their implementation, we would urge the Council not to assume to itself rights and responsibilities that it does not have.  There is a further point, which we have made in this Council before. By definition, it is States that are parties to the treaty-based system of international law. By and large, they respect them, and when they do not, penalties arise, through the provisions of the treaties. When their actions gravely threaten peace and security, sanctions can be brought against them by action in this Council. The most egregious crimes against women in times of conflict, however, have been and are committed by irregular forces, often warring against Governments; they obey no laws and are, as experience has shown throughout the 1990s, much more immune to sanctions than Governments are. How, in practical terms, will the Council tackle these forces, which are responsible for the bulk of the crimes that continue to be committed against women?  Situations of conflict vary. Each has its own causes and consequences. Clearly, there cannot be off- the-shelf remedies or panaceas. We need to take practical and effective steps to mitigate the impact of conflict on women and to enhance their ability to restore and preserve peace. The Namibia Plan of Action on Mainstreaming a Gender Perspective in Multidimensional Peace Support Operations has many useful elements. We support the call in the Windhoek Declaration of 31 May 2000 urging the Secretary- General to ensure that appropriate follow-up measures are taken to implement this Plan of Action, in consultation with Member States.  The World Bank estimates that by 2015 the world will have more than 1.9 billion poor, most of them women. Globalization has affected both men and women, but women bear the double burden of inequality and marginalization. Empowering them is therefore both crucial and urgent. The Council will remember that the theme of the special session of the General Assembly in June this year was \"Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty- first century\". In considering the role of women in peace and security, the Council will, I am sure, bear in mind this wider perspective of the empowerment of women.  This may well be the last statement we will make in the Security Council before Namibia completes its current two-year term. We would therefore like to place on record our very warm appreciation for the work of the Namibian delegation in the Council, and for the courageous and independent stand Namibia has taken on difficult issues on its agenda.  ",
    " The United States warmly welcomes this open debate on women and peace and security. We pay a special tribute to Secretary-General Annan for his remarks and fully concur with his report statement:  \"Equality of rights, opportunities and access to resources between men and women are fundamental requirements\" (A\/52\/87]\/, para. 89)  in building a durable peace.  I want to join Ambassador Durrant in paying a special tribute to you, Mr. President, and to Ambassador Andjaba, for your leadership in bringing about this important meeting. I also want to pay a special warm welcome to Ms. Angela King, Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, and to Ms. Heyzer, Executive Director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women. This invitation this morning is long overdue and I hope that this body will meet the challenge that you have put to us today. It is an historic challenge that you put before us. We warmly welcome that.  I also want to pay a special welcome to our guests in the gallery. I think your participation and support are very important and I think this is the first time I have ever heard applause in this Chamber. So you are enlivening it.  Today's meeting must not only make us more aware of the important role women play in preventing conflict, encouraging reconciliation and helping to rebuild conflict-ridden societies, but it also must spur us to concrete action. We, in the international community, have failed to make maximum use of the contributions of women in our efforts to promote peace and security throughout the world. As Secretary of State Albright pointed out in a recent speech to a group of businesswomen, \"in too many places, women remain an undervalued and underdeveloped human resource.\"  We applaud the unwavering efforts of the United Nations and its specialized agencies to confront problems that mostly affect women. The work of these bodies and the international community's moral and financial support for such efforts has changed the lives of many, both young and old. Working together, we have taken steps to promote equality of opportunity, educate women and girls, change the unbalanced inheritance and divorce laws, advance political and economic rights and eradicate traditional practices harmful to women and girls.  Much of our attention has been directed toward protecting women, especially from the devastating effects of armed conflict, including forced displacement, trafficking of women, torture, rape and other acts of sexual violence, as well as a host of other crimes. For example, the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights focused on women solely as victims of armed conflict. While the issue of protection of women cannot be ignored, I hope that Security Council action will emphasize the leadership role women can and should play in restoring peace.  Women are an under-utilized positive force for peace. The Fourth World Conference on Women recognized that they must be fully involved in preventing and resolving conflicts. We must actively promote formal mechanisms, which support a consistent female presence at the peace table, in peacekeeping operations and in the peace building efforts to reconstruct institutions vital to lasting stability.  The Secretary-General, by appointing qualified women to visible positions of influence, has set a laudable example for us all to follow. Deputy Secretary-General Louise Frechette, High Commissioners Mary Robinson and Sadako Ogata, the United Nations Children's Fund's Carol Bellamy and the World Food Programme's Catherine Bertini, to name just a few, demonstrate daily that women do make a difference in defusing conflicts and promoting equality, peace and security. The challenge before us is to emulate their achievements in other international and regional organizations, in national Governments and across all levels of society. The United States applauds the appointment of these women, but we want to see more done.  In particular, we need more women as Special Representatives of the Secretary-General, as special envoys and as human rights investigators and monitors. We hope the Secretary-General will strive to appoint more, fully qualified women to these positions, as well as those within his own Secretariat. We strongly encourage Member States to bring such candidates to his attention and to support the idea of the United Nations maintaining a roster of qualified women maintained as part of the United Nations Standby Arrangements System.  We need more than influential women at the highest levels of power and prestige. The United Nations must ensure that women's voices are heard wherever the United Nations assists in the settlement of conflicts and in post-conflict peace-building. With all due respect to my colleagues, just look around this room. A good place to start would be for Member States to appoint more women as ambassadors to the United Nations. Certainly one woman Permanent Representative, the distinguished Patricia Durrant, out of 15 on the Security Council, is at least 6 or 7 too few. Ten women out of 189 Permanent Representatives is a sad commentary on the state of women in leadership positions of Member States. If we are to heed President Theo-Ben Gurirab's challenge that we all just heard in the video to make women half of every solution, Member States must be able to do better than five per cent.  In all phases of peacekeeping and peace-building missions the presence of women must be visible and consistent. When possible, fact-finding missions should include gender advisors and the terms of reconciliation and reconstruction should draw on the expertise of women's community groups. The immediate aftermath of a conflict provides a unique window of opportunity to rebuild, with the equal participation of women, the public security institutions vital to lasting stability. In order to facilitate this, States should be committed to gender balance in their contributions to civilian police and other peacekeeping contingents and to assisting other States in achieving a gender-balanced perspective.  In place after place, from Northern Ireland to Guatemala to South Africa, we see that women are most effective when they are able to organize and be heard. Our First Lady's involvement in the organization Vital Voices has demonstrated around the world this fact time and again. We, as members of the Security Council, cannot be content with token representation of half of the world's population. The Security Council should consider establishing a very specifically mandated expert panel or working group to report on mechanisms that will ensure equal representation of women in peacekeeping and peace-building operations.  We also need to prepare our United Nations peacekeepers for encounters with the entire population in a mission area. This means that peacekeepers- military, civilian and civil servants - should be trained in gender issues; and it means that they who violate women's most basic rights must be brought to justice. The training should focus on codes of conduct and cultural and societal norms with respect to women, and on the study of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women.  At managerial levels training should include the participation of women in institution-building, particularly in rule-of-law areas. The Training Unit of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations should develop exportable modules that may be used in national and regional programmes, and all United Nations training programmes must include elements on gender issues.  We encourage States to assist in other meaningful ways as well. The United States, for example, has provided funding to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to support the Bosnian Women's Initiative, which promotes the reintegration of women into the economy. It emphasizes training, legal assistance and support for micro-enterprise projects. Likewise, the United States has supported the Rwanda Women's Initiative to address refugee women's reintegration. The Department of State has also provided support for the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children, which operates in Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan and the Sudan. Those programmes not only provide services to women in war-torn areas, but they also seek to integrate them into the political and economic lives of their countries.  As we move forward we should take care that our efforts to further empower women in no way disadvantage men. We should strive for equality, not special treatment. What we really need is a commitment from Member States of the United Nations, the Secretariat and all concerned to honour the obligations and promises already made to women. We should now look ahead to concrete initiatives in support of those promises.  In closing, let me again commend you and your delegation, Mr. President, for calling this important meeting today. I hope this meeting will be the beginning of regular discussions in this Chamber, and that one day there will be equal gender representation around this table and throughout these halls.  ",
    " My delegation joins others in congratulating you, Mr. President, on calling this debate on women and peace and security. We also appreciate statements made earlier by Ms. Angela King and Ms. Noeleen Heyzer. On this subject we are happy to share the thoughts of the President of the Republic of Rwanda, Mr. Paul Kagame, and all the members of the Cabinet, especially the Minister for Gender and Women in Development, who all strongly speak out in favour of empowering women for durable peace and sustainable development. Peace is a prerequisite for sustainable development, and women have a lot to oflbn  In most African traditional societies and modern societies throughout the world, solidarity with one another has been the best chance for peace and security. Such solidarity is gradually shaped and built from the early days of our lives, and we owe this acquisition to mothers - and fathers of course - whoever we may be and wherever we may be from. The focal point for all family life is the wife, the mother, the \"she citizen\" of the world. Unfortunately, what she offers and gives is not always what she gets in return when wars and calamities break out. The time is right for her to have a say in this at all levels and in all institutions. All hardships and abuses befall her, but she never gives up. Stories from Rwanda teach us all that when political and ethnic tensions cause conflict, women have come as one to suggest building bridges rather than walls. The Security Council has done well, but it could do better; it can help women in knocking walls down and building bridges between people and cultures. In post-genocide Rwanda, women still carry the burden of responsibility and caring for their children, orphans, the elderly and husbands in prisons. Women have assumed the entire role of breadwinners and are shouldering multiple challenges despite the fact that 54 per cent are illiterate, and the majority of them live below the poverty line.  Those who made women widows in Rwanda, in Burundi and in the Balkans and those who raped them and left them with infections, diseases and consequences of all sorts, including unwanted pregnancies and HIV\/AIDS, are still at large and active. They are killing and raping more women and girls across borders, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in Burundi and elsewhere, under the silence of many who, contrariwise, should arrest them according to several Security Council resolutions and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide that we all signed. Instead, these criminals curiously still enjoy the world's attention, especially those in Arusha and in Rwanda's prisons or in big cities of the world. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, they cease to be what they are - meaning criminals, rapists and killers - the day they agree to join the ranks of the Kabila forces and his allies, who are creating more havoc when peace and security are at stake. And this body seems powerless to take timely and decisive action.  Adding insult to injury, the agony is still not over for those women who were victims of rape as a weapon of genocide. As witnesses at the International Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, they are indeed compelled to tell their stories in an all-male environment - the judges, the interpreters and everyone else are all men. More attention should be drawn to this situation and it should be swiftly addressed by the Council if peace and security are for all, including women victims of rape as a weapon of genocide. Let competent women - and there are many - be recruited and do the job. We cannot accept double standards even if we have to live with them.  My delegation reiterates that the presence of such criminals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to be a threat to the security of our people and to our sovereignty. Rwanda is in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to stop them from killing and raping more innocent women, girls and children. Rwanda is there to get them and many of those taken hostages back. It does so within the framework of the Lusaka Agreement framework, as negotiated and agreed by all parties, welcomed by the Council and, thus far, not changed by any United Nations resolution, as wrongly stated by the representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In September alone - in one month - we were blessed to get back to Rwanda from the Democratic Republic of the Congo 17,000 of our people - women, children and men. And we will continue to get them back to where they belong, within the law. The international community should encourage and contribute to this effort as a genuine search for peace and security rather than keeping quiet and dwelling on non-priority issues. We take this opportunity to thank the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for the assistance given to us and to the returnees who are being reintegrated into their societies, as over a million others have been since November 1996.  Against this picture of continued inaction by the international community, and this body in particular, as regards the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and the region - although I know efforts are being made - women have come together to form associations nationally and regionally and, with the assistance of our Government, have established women's councils and have elected representatives from villages to the national level for the first time ever in the history of Rwanda. Peace-building is high on the agenda of women in their various development activities. We encourage them to continue because they are right and because it is the right thing to do. Women have indeed understood that there is no possible development activity if there is no peace at home and across our borders. Peace and security are the prime responsibility of this body, and women have a right to be involved, especially where we men have failed. They have proved they can do it. Let us involve them and empower them.  Namibia has done a great job in promoting advocacy for women, and we once again congratulate Namibia and its leadership. Rwanda, on her part, has hosted two international conferences on women and peace. The first one, the Pan-African Conference of Peace, Gender and Development, was organized in March 1997, and the Kigali Declaration was adopted under the auspices of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and the Organization of African Unity (OAU). The second one, which took place in June, was entitled Women as Partners for Peace. It was organized by the current Ambassador of the United States to Rwanda and his extended team, to whom we express our sincere thanks and congratulations. The conclusions and recommendations of all these conferences whether in Kampala, Dakar, Johannesburg, Kigali or Windhoek, should be translated into action to make sure that women get what they deserve and on time.  In a bid to promote peace and security, Rwandan women have undertaken various other important activities that are worth mentioning and from which we could learn. First, a programme called Action Campaign for Peace was launched by Pro-Femme Twese Hamwe, an umbrella organization that brings together Rwandan women's non-governmental organizations. Secondly, a peace village was built by the Rwandan Women's Alliance and Solidarity (ASOFERWA), which supports genocide widows; the village is dedicated to and named after the former President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela. Thirdly, because of such peace initiatives the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization awarded Rwandan women a prize for peace and tolerance in 1997. Fourthly, in a bid to contribute in the area of resolving conflicts and promoting peace in the region, Rwanda hosted the international conference to which I referred earlier, under the auspices of the OAU and the Economic Commission for Africa.  This Rwandan experience and many others in the region and beyond speak to the Council and should be given attention. In the search for peace and security for all, one of the best strategies for conflict prevention is to extend the role of women as peacemakers from the village council in the hinterland of any given country Member of this Organization, to this very Chamber where peace and security are supposed to be ensured for all, without any distinction. The distance to be covered seems too long, but we are sure to reach the final objective if we empower women and take them on board.  As rightly expressed in Africa by President Kagame on 25 June 2000, when opening the conference entitled Women as Partners for Peace, \"The twentieth century failed to acknowledge the role of women in conflict resolution and the search for peace. Yet everybody knows that when there is war, the heaviest toll falls on women and children. It is now time to bridge this gap because without the involvement of our mothers, sisters and daughters within and outside our borders, we cannot find lasting peace. For a long time, women have been relegated to the periphery of political activities. Governments have to put in place policy instruments and institutions which will enable women to play an important role in the area of peace, reconciliation and conflict resolution It is not only wars that undermine peace. Human rights abuses, social injustice, poverty and bad governance are some of the factors that should be examined in order to tackle conflict on several fronts.\"  In conclusion, the Rwanda Government's commitment to increase the participation of women in creating and promoting peace should guide the Council and its membership to adequately address the issue of peace and security by involving women. They have experiences to share and a clear, strong will to destroy all myths and prejudices around and against them. The Council needs to be gender-sensitive as many of us here have become, but also, and especially, needs to act to bring women to the negotiating table in order to help us to reach the lasting peace and security for which we long.

    " I thank you, Sir, for conducting this meeting today. I know that, in the next few days, you will be returning home to a warm, sunny Namibia - for a while, I hope - and I just want to pay tribute to you and to tell you before this body that you have made us proud to be people of southern Africa and, more importantly, to be Africans. Your stewardship in the General Assembly and in this body has made us keep the faith that things could, indeed, get better. I thank you very, very much for everything you have done for us during your term of visit in New York.  In our commitment to dealing with conflicts in a comprehensive manner, including addressing the root causes of conflicts, we must acknowledge that the widespread exclusion of women from political and economic decision-making is a significant obstacle to the realization of sustainable global peace and security. In other words, and as was so concisely summed up in a very powerful and simple statement in the final declaration of the All-Party Burundi Women's Peace Conference, held in Arusha from 17 to 20 July 2000, \"women's rights are human rights\".  The significance of women's active contributions to South Africa's liberation and their relevance to today's debate go far beyond South Africa, our subregion and even our continent. Indeed, for South Africa and the rest of us in the region of the Southern African Development Community, this topic has special relevance, bearing in mind the critical and essential roles played by women in our struggles for liberation from colonization, apartheid, conflict and repression. These women, and many others elsewhere in the world, have demonstrated that women have an indispensable social, political and economic role to play in bringing about sustainable peace and security.  It was for this reason that, on 9 August this year, at our National Women's Day celebrations, the South African President dedicated a monument in tribute to the role played by women in shaping a democratic, non-racist and non-sexist South Africa. In that ceremony, President Mbeki unveiled the portraits of courageous and dedicated women leaders, such as Lilian Ngoyi, Helen Joseph, Raheema Moosa and Sophie de Bruyn. These leaders were at the forefront of the struggle for a just society in South Africa. We pay special tribute to them for their role in leading the mass defiance campaigns against apartheid legislation and to the many unsung heroines of that struggle, which culminated in 1956 with a march by tens of thousands of women to Pretoria. Thanks to the positive examples and contributions of pioneering leaders such as these, South Africa is today committed to achieving and sustaining equal participation and representation of women in our Parliament and Government, which currently stand at about 30 per cent.  It is true that, in today's conflicts, it is civilians, and women and children in particular, who bear the brunt of gross abuses of human rights. There is another dimension, however, and we need to move beyond the limited approach of portraying women solely as victims in conflicts.  For all societies in this world, and more so for societies in conflict, women play a key role in sustaining both the family and the wider community. In many developing countries, our communities are fracturing under the combined weight of internecine conflicts, poverty, communicable diseases such as HIV\/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, mass urbanization, economic restructuring and other effects of globalization. More often than not, it is the working women who must quite literally put bread on the table and hold families together.  Given the central role that women play in the social, political and economic development of our societies, it is morally right and logical that the full realization of equal political and economic rights for women must be treated as an essential component of our collective approach to preventing and resolving conflicts.  In Africa, where there are already signs that there is a political and economic revival, it is clear that women have played, must play and will continue to play a full role in the renaissance of our continent. Anything less, therefore, would be short-sighted, and despite our best intentions, our collective commitment to address the root causes of conflicts will come to naught unless women are afforded an equal role.  In her address to the General Assembly on 13 September 2000, South Africa's Foreign Minister, Ms. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, said,  \"The founders of the United Nations based the Charter on the assertion of human dignity, human rights and the equality of women and men and the aim of promoting better social standards. (A\/55\/PV.]3, p.]])  The equality of women and men still remains a subject of great concern. All we need to do is look around this Hall to realize how far we are from realizing the vision of the founding Members of the United Nations. Secondly, the feminization of poverty is a big problem. The marginalization of women, both in their countries and in the multilateral forums, means that our countries and organizations, including the United Nations, are functioning at half-capacity and are deprived of the unique qualities, energies and creativity that women would bring.\" (ibid., p.12) We have all already agreed that the root causes of  conflict are poverty, disease, lack of education, lack of human and political rights and a lack of economic opportunity and justice. We must now equally agree that we cannot adequately address these problems if we exclude over half of humanity from enjoying these rights. Neither can we do so if we continue to prevent womankind from participating in the process of finding and implementing solutions.  As a minimum, we suggest that we must pay special attention to the impact of armed conflicts on the rights of women and girls and promote and implement specific strategies to protect and assist women and girls in armed conflicts. We must promote strategies that maximize women's participation in domestic, regional and international conflict prevention, management and resolution initiatives. The United Nations must set an example by making sure women are represented adequately at all decision- -making levels. In addition, we must promote and strengthen women's participation in comprehensive post- conflict peace- building initiatives, including in such areas as electoral, constitutional, legal and judicial reforms.  In conclusion, let me say that it is my delegation's hope that today's debate in the Security Council will strengthen existing efforts in the United Nations system, including in the General Assembly and in the relevant United Nations agencies, to improve the status of women globally.  My delegation would like to express its profound thanks to the presidency of the Council for this month for placing the issue of women and peace and security on the agenda. We also welcome the transparent and participatory approach adopted by the presidency this month in arranging today's debate. The imaginative use of the Arria formula to hold yesterday's consultations between Council members and non-State actors from international women's rights organizations and other human rights organizations is further welcome, as they have much to offer our deliberations and decisions.  This is further evidence of the positive trend towards the adoption of more open working methods and procedures in the Security Council. We indeed appreciate that.  ",
    " I have the honour to address the Security Council in the debate on the issue of women and peace and security. Allow me first to express my appreciation to you, Sir, for your initiative on this issue as President of the Security Council for the month of October.  I would like to welcome the statements delivered earlier by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan; by the Assistant Secretary-General and Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, Ms. Angela King; and by the Executive Director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), Ms. Noeleen Heyzer.  The issue of women and peace and security is among the paramount items on the global agenda and, in fact, has been addressed over several decades. At the international conferences on women, the issue of women and peace was taken up as early as the Nairobi World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women and has since been more than adequately considered in United Nations forums, such as in the annual meetings of the Commission on the Status of Women and of the Third Committee of the General Assembly, and also by various United Nations bodies, such as UNIFEM. and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).  At the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995, it was clearly recognized that the larger goals of equality, development and peace could not be achieved without the incorporation of the women's perspective at all levels of decision-making. One of the important steps taken on that occasion was to stress that women's involvement in decision-making was not only a question of quotas for women, but a process that also entails increased gender sensitivity in general, requiring appropriate training and more research on gender issues.  My delegation would also like to draw attention to the efforts that have been made at the regional level to address this issue. We commend the work that has been accomplished under the auspices of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), especially in convening the regional preparatory meeting for the follow-up of the Beijing Conference on Women in June 2000, which, inter alia, highlights peace processes with action to encourage the full participation of women at all levels of decision- making in conflict resolution, peacekeeping, peacemaking and preventive diplomacy.  We also welcome the initiative of ESCAP and UNESCO to convene a Regional Conference on Asian Women for a Culture of Peace, to be held in Hanoi in December this year. The plan of action to be adopted at that Conference is expected to promote equal participation in peacekeeping, peacemaking and preventive diplomacy. Moreover, it will outline the contribution of women to a culture of peace and sustainable development in Asia. We are confident that this forum will provide a comprehensive assessment of Asian women's political, social and economic empowerment and the educational requirements needed to strengthen their capacities to transform societies towards a culture of peace.  Let me underscore that violence against women should remain at the forefront of all agendas concerning the situation of women and should be regarded as a criminal offence. In that regard, I would note that Indonesia has adopted a \"zero tolerance\" policy on Violence against women, and we are working with national women's groups, law enforcement and legislators to comprehensively address this serious problem. In fact, the State Minister for Women's Empowerment officially announced a joint State and community proclamation to eliminate Violence against women, involving the Vice President, all Cabinet ministers and parliamentarians, including representatives of national and regional groups. The international community and regional and national groups should no longer accept the committing of acts against women with impunity. My delegation underlines the importance of such national efforts to address violence against women receiving the full support of the international community.  My delegation underlines that this issue should be addressed not only from the perspective of treating women as victims of armed conflicts, but also as makers of peace. Although historically women have maintained the family structure under the most difficult of circumstances and have very often assumed the role of head of household, there is still a lack of participation of women in the peace process. The burden is disproportionately borne by women when peace breaks down, and seldom are women given a visible role in the decision-making process for making and maintaining peace.  I would like to note that one of the strategic objectives of the Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women is to increase the participation of women in conflict resolution at decision-making levels and to protect women living in situations of armed conflict and other conflicts or under foreign occupation. While this goal must be pursued at the national level, it is important also to pursue it within the United Nations itself, with the appointment of women to senior posts and with equal participation in peace processes and conflict resolution. Indonesia therefore joins all those who call for a concerted effort by the international community to increase the participation of women in negotiations on conflict resolution and in decision- making positions at both national and international levels.  The Security Council itself could consider the importance of injecting the gender dimension into its decisions on conflict resolution and of its resolutions providing for a clear mandate on gender mainstreaming. With regard to fact-finding missions, the Council could include gender issues in their terms of reference. Likewise, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations could provide gender- sensitivity training for peacekeepers in the field and foster an awareness of the traumatic circumstances faced by women.  In considering the issue of women and peace and armed conflict we must not lose sight of the need to also address the root causes of conflicts and the link between social and economic development and peace and stability - especially so given the fact that women are disproportionately burdened by poverty. There is a need to develop and strengthen strategies and initiatives to reduce women's poverty levels and to protect women from the rapid changes inherent in globalization.  In addressing the overall issue of women and peace and security, Indonesia would agree that measures for that purpose could be developed through close cooperation between the Security Council, the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council, noting that none of these organs is equipped to exclusively and comprehensively deal with these issues.  In concluding, while we support the initiative of the United Nations to deliberate on any areas relating to peace and security, we do hope that its activities will not duplicate those of other intergovernmental bodies, but rather will serve to complement those efforts.  ",
    " Mr. President, let me in turn commend you for have placed on the agenda of this Security Council meeting the item entitled \"Women, peace and security\".  I should like also to thank the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, Ms. King, as well as the Executive Director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), Ms. Heyzer, for their outstanding contributions to this debate. I would add to this list Mr. Guehenno, Under- Secretary-General for the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, whom I wish to thank for the information he has given us this morning.  Women and girls remain vulnerable in time of peace and in time of war because of the profound gender inequalities that still characterize our societies. In time of conflict, they are targets for all kinds of violence, in particular rape and other sexual attacks.  They are also the majority of victims of anti- personnel land mines, and they are the most vulnerable to the scourge of HIV\/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases due to sexual violence and to the failure of our health-care systems. Their fundamental rights are continually flouted.  The rights of women and girls are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights, and the abuses they endure in situations of armed conflict are violations of international law applicable to the rights and to the protection of women and girls as civilian persons. Also, one cannot stress enough the need for scrupulous compliance with the provisions of international humanitarian law and of the various instruments concerning human rights that guarantee the protection of women and girls during and after conflicts. We also believe that it is the duty of Member States to put an end to impunity and to prosecute those who are guilty of crimes, exaction and acts of sexual violence against women and girls. In this regard, my delegation welcomes the fact that the International Criminal Court, in accordance with the Rome Statute, has declared acts of sexual violence in times of conflict to be a war crime and in some specific circumstances to be a crime against humanity.  In addition, due to the regrettable events of the recent past, it seems useful to consider the creation of a code of conduct for the personnel of peacekeeping missions and the implementation of a system for the notification of sexual violence in peacekeeping.  Women are educators for peace both within their families and in their societies. More and more, they play an effective role in negotiations and contribute to the creation of an environment favourable to the resolution of conflicts and to peace-building. Therefore, my delegation fully supports the idea of incorporating the general considerations of gender equality in peacekeeping missions.  In addition, peacekeeping operations are by nature multifaceted and complex, involving humanitarian assistance, political aspects, the holding of elections, and programmes for disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and reconstruction. All that requires, for the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security, a more complete understanding of the impact of armed conflicts on local populations, especially on women and children.  For that reason, we welcome the study being completed by the Secretary-General on following up and implementing Council resolution 1325 (2000). That resolution offers a global political framework for addressing the role of women in the post-conflict political process. It earnestly appeals to Member States to take appropriate measures so that women will be better represented at all levels of decision-making in national, regional and international institutions and mechanisms for the prevention, management and resolution of conflict.  In its declaration of 2000 on the occasion of the International Women's Day, the Security Council recognized that women and girls were particularly affected by the consequences of armed conflict. In addition, the Council recognized that peace was inextricably linked to the equality of men and women and declared that the maintenance and promotion of peace and security required the equal participation of women in decision-making. Women should therefore be able to take their rightful place at the table of decision-making on questions of peace and security.  In this regard, my country would like to encourage the appointment of women as special representatives and envoys in missions to pursue good offices on behalf of the Secretary-General. Accordingly, we welcome the supporting and advising role of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) in promoting the participation of women in the decision-making process at all levels peacekeeping and peace-building.  It is with genuine interest that we have followed the preparation of the report of the Secretary-General on the effects of armed conflict on women and girls. We have also studied the assessments made on the ground with the coordination of UNIFEM, which perfectly complement that study. We believe that the study is right on target in that it enables the Security Council and the other principal organs of the United Nations, particularly the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council, to have at their disposal new information leading to a better understanding of the needs of women on questions of peace and security.  We welcome the synergy of efforts made in the preparation of this study, which is part of the follow-up to Council resolution 1325 (2000). We support UNIFEM's evaluation of various conflict situations. We also encourage priority being given to women and to peace-building in the framework of cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations. We hope that the networks of women involved in the struggle for the peace and security of nations can contribute to those efforts.  We also welcome the recommendations of the seminar workshop of UNIFEM's consultations on Central Africa, which took place in my country, at Douala, from 28 to 30 May 2002. In this context, networks and organizations of the women of Central Africa for peace have asked the Economic Community of Central African States to strengthen its support and collaboration with them in order to ensure the greater participation of women in the management of conflicts and in peace-building in the subregion.  Accordingly, in its sixteenth ministerial meeting, the United Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa recommended the creation of a network of women of Central Africa for peace with a view to involving them in ongoing peace negotiations on Central African conflicts. In this regard, I would like to mention the remarkable role played by women in the recent inter-Congolese negotiations on the political situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which took place in Sun City.  In conclusion, the delegation of Cameroon awaits with interest the final text of the Secretary-General's report on women, girls, peace and security, to be published in October 2002. Cameroon hopes that today's debate will strengthen the efforts of the United  Nations system to improve the conditions of all women.  ",
    " Allow me to begin by expressing our appreciation to you, Mr. President, for convening today's open debate on this item. We welcome this discussion on an issue that we consider of great importance. We also look forward to the independent expert assessment on the impact of armed conflict on women and the role of women in peace- building. We View the present initiative as an important opportunity to reflect on the plight of women in conflict situations as well as on their role in conflict resolution, conflict prevention and peace-building.  The plight of women in armed conflict has a history which is as long as the history of warfare. The American writer Kate Richards O'Hare wrote almost a century ago: \"It is the women who pay the price while war rages, and it will be the women who will pay again when war has run its bloody course\". There are specific injunctions - in the Geneva Conventions and in human rights instruments - proscribing torture, violence, rape and other ill-treatment of women during conflicts. Unfortunately, those injunctions have been honoured more in the breach than in the observance.  The march of civilization has not reduced the suffering and special vulnerabilities of women in situations of armed conflict. Crimes against women have been frequent in several recent and ongoing conflicts. Systematic rape has been used to terrorize populations, force displacement and demoralize adversaries - as in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In Afghanistan's two decades of conflict, the destitution of hundreds of thousands of women was a pervasive consequence.  In the ongoing freedom struggle in Jammu and Kashmir also, rape and the humiliation of women and girls have been used by the occupation army as an instrument of war. Human rights organizations have testified since 1992 that in Jammu and Kashmir \"rape and ill-treatment of women are usually reported to have taken place during counter-insurgency operations\" by Indian forces. Asia Watch and Physicians for Human Rights documented the extensive use of rape by the occupation forces designed \"to punish and humiliate the entire community.\" Amnesty International has reported that \"harassment, abduction, rape and deliberate and arbitrary killings perpetrated by [pro- Indian] 'renegades' in Kashmir\" are also carried out \"with the support of the [Indian] security forces\".  Destitution of women is another manifestation of the conflict in Kashmir. There are thousands of women who have been widowed, or whose husbands have been maimed, have disappeared or are in detention. We urge the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to prepare a survey of the number of such destitute Kashmiri women. The international community should take appropriate measures to provide help and compensation to those Kashmiri women. We urge humanitarian agencies, specially the International Committee of the Red Cross, to act as the instrument and avenue for such relief distribution. Political considerations should not stand in the way of international humanitarian agencies responding to the plight of Kashmiri women and children suffering from the long and bloody conflict in their homeland.  In April 2000, the Security Council adopted its landmark resolution 1325 (2000) on women and armed conflict. The Beijing Declaration and the Platform of Action also contain comprehensive recommendations on women and armed conflict. The Security Council must strengthen the processes for the observance and implementation of the principles of international humanitarian law and human rights in international  conflicts, including those relating to the protection of women.  We believe that the Council must not only ensure prompt and effective responses to crisis situations, irrespective of their geographical location, but also avoid selectivity in the implementation of its resolutions. The Charter contains provisions, including those in Chapter VI, which can be utilized to promote implementation of Council resolutions.  In the international experts assessment and the Secretary-General's report several relevant proposals have been submitted to the Council. The Pakistan delegation further suggests the following measures for the Council's consideration.  First, the Council should adopt a declaration that the targeting of women, especially the use of rape as an instrument of war, will be considered a war crime, susceptible to national and international punishment. Secondly, a study of recent and ongoing conflict situations should be initiated to identify crimes committed against women, with a view to seeking redress and compensation for the victims.  Thirdly, current and future United Nations peacekeeping operations be required to monitor, and regularly report to the Security Council on, the situation of women and girls in their mission areas. Fourthly, the fullest possible participation of women in peace processes and in post-conflict peace-building should be encouraged, including the reintegration, reconstruction and rehabilitation of societies in the post-conflict phase.  Fifthly, the United Nations specialized organs and agencies should be asked to develop ways to address the special needs of women and girls affected by conflict, including health and psychological care. Sixthly, the Security Council may involve other United Nations bodies, as well as representatives of the civil society, perhaps using the Arria formula, for a comprehensive discussion to promote such recommendations and actions.  ",
    " The organization of this meeting is evidence of our Council's will and determination to continue to assume our responsibilities in the framework of the follow-of resolution 1325 (2000), entitled \"Women, peace and security\". Through this resolution the Security Council underscored not only the impact of conflict on women but also their role in conflict settlement and in peace- building. It also emphasized the duties of the different players in the international community. The important presentations just made by Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno, Ms. Angela King and Ms. Noeleen Heyzer shed further light on the efforts that are under way for the effective implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). I would like, on this occasion, to express my delegation's appreciation to them for the quality of the work accomplished.  By adopting the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the international community recognized, among other things, the importance of questions related to women in armed conflict. The conclusions of the 1998 and 2001 sessions of the Commission on the Status of Women, as well as the recommendations of the ad hoc committee of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, \"Beijing plus five\", also underscored these questions in many regards.  In the framework of the effective implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) for which responsibility falls on Governments, on the United Nations system, on regional and subregional organizations, as well as on non-governmental organizations and civil society, the following considerations deserve to be emphasized.  First, within the United Nations system, every body must identify clearly those areas in which it can make its contribution. The tank will then be to seek out areas of complementarity among the different bodies. In this regard, cooperation between Ms. Angela King's office, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is to be encouraged.  Secondly, at the country, regional and subregional levels, it will be necessary to strengthen the accomplishments, to share experiences and to envisage appropriate solutions. In this context, I am pleased to note the important role being played by Guinean women aimed at putting an end to instability in the West African subregion. In fact, the Network of African Women Ministers and Parliamentarians (REFAMP) organized a subregional conference in Conakry, from 24 to 26 January 2000 on the prevention and settlement of conflicts.  This initiative was supported by the women of the Mano River Union, at the subregional level, as was indicated a while ago by Ms. Angela King. My delegation appreciates similar initiatives undertaken in other regions and subregions, and believes that the United Nations should gather information on these different experiences, so that it can be shared with the international community.  Thirdly, in the context of non-governmental organizations, we appreciate the work of the Working Group on Women, International Peace and Security. Its actions deserve to be supported by all. We also believe that a sharing of experiences among these different parties will contribute to an overall understanding of the question before us.  My delegation appreciates the role of coordination played by Ms. Angela King's office through the establishment of a study group on resolution 1325 (2000) to contribute to the preparation of the Secretary-General's report. We are awaiting this report with interest. In our opinion, it will take into account the multidimensional nature of the impact of conflicts on women and young girls, as well as their role in the prevention and settlement of conflicts and in peace-building.  We are also convinced that the report will assess the implementation of the different provisions of the resolution and identify the obstacles to be overcome, while placing emphasis on the respective responsibilities of the different players. My country, Guinea, which has experience in the area now before us, is prepared to make its contribution to this shared effort.  ",
    " I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this discussion, as we prepare to mark, this October, the second anniversary of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women, peace and security.  Before addressing the areas in which the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) has made concrete progress in implementing that resolution, I would like to say something on a personal note. When I arrived at the head of the DPKO, almost two years ago, I sensed from various quarters some scepticism about the dialogue about gender mainstreaming. Many appeared to misperceive it as a superficial exercise in political correctness. I should confess that I was not always immune from this misperception.  It is now plainly obvious, though, that such an attitude is not only misguided; it is also a drastic misunderstanding of what gender mainstreaming is all about. Gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping is about recognizing that all segments of society are affected by conflict, sometimes in different ways, and that all segments of society also have a role to play in helping to end the violence and lay the foundation for sustainable peace.  Traditionally, we have underestimated this point, because we wrongly assumed that conflict and peace are gender-blind. They are not. Certain crimes, whose incidents can increase in a conflict setting, are specifically targeted at women and girls. Certain efforts at reconciliation have a totally different dynamic when women are included in the peace process. In some case, women's groups comprise individuals who were not engaged in combat, and thus might be more open to dialogue. In other cases, the women's group concerns can be more radicalized, because they consist of those whose husbands, fathers and sons were killed during the fighting. Furthermore, we should not assume that all combatants are men. There are women combatants, and, sadly, child soldiers as well.  The need for heightened gender perspective applies to all areas of work in a peacekeeping mission, including in areas one might otherwise overlook. Take, for example, a very small but illustrative case.  In East Timor, the United Nations was given the unprecedented role of administering the territory. This included running the prisons and building correctional facilities. It may not immediately occur to many that not all prisoners are men. There are women who commit crimes, and they are in quite separate prison facilities. As a result, there is a requirement to hire women corrections officers, often through proactive recruitment.  In order to properly budget for these distinct requirements, among others, one needs to be able to forecast crime rates among women. The United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), facing urgent demands, did not think about this until its work was considerably advanced. It thus had to address this issue post facto, once the recruitment process for prison guards was almost complete. Taking all of these factors into account is not political correctness. It is just part of the job.  The example that I have just given is a very small one among hundreds. There can be a gender dimension to virtually every aspect of what peacekeepers do, whether it would be dealing with the perpetrators of crime, the victims of violence, or the political actors and civic leaders with whom the real prospects of sustainable peace reside. Recognizing these facts and taking action accordingly is what gender mainstreaming is all about.  As far as DPKO is concerned, we do not need further convincing that gender awareness must feature more prominently in our work. I am pleased to report that the Department of Peacekeeping Operations has made some concrete progress in implementing resolution 1325 (2000) within specific peacekeeping operations, notably in East Timor, in Kosovo, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in Sierra Leone and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Five special focus areas stand out in particular, as follows: addressing gender-based violence; responding to the trafficking in women and children; incorporating gender perspectives into the process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of refugees and displaced persons, including former combatants; facilitating the participation of women in constitutional and electoral reform and civil administration; and lastly, combating the spread of HIV\/AIDS. We have done quite a lot of work in each of these five areas, though in deference to time limitation on our opening statement, I will just note a few highlights at this stage.  Since the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH) launched a nationwide domestic violence project in November 2001, more than 300 cases of domestic violence and sexual abuse have been reported and acted upon by the police. Anti- trafficking efforts of UNMIBH have been enhanced since March 1999, by creating the so-called STOP programme - Special Trafficking Operations Project- in July 2001, which has since conducted over 400 operations against bars and brothels. Some 1,442 women and girls have been interviewed and offered assistance with repatriation. Three safe houses for trafficking victims have been established in coordination with the International Organization for Migration.  In Kosovo, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo promulgated a Trafficking in Human Persons Regulation for the protection of victims.  In the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, mission personnel received training and advice on how to mainstream the gender perspective into all areas of their work. This covers all areas from human rights monitoring, including dealing with crimes of sexual abuse, gender violence and exploitation, to dealing with the different needs of male and female, and child, ex-combatants.  In East Timor - which is perhaps the best example of how maintaining the focus on gender, or gender mainstreaming, can yield significant results - political parties voluntarily included women on the tickets after considerable debate within the Timorese civil society. As a result, women represented 27 per cent of the total number of candidates returned to the Constituent Assembly, the highest percentage ever under a United Nations-sponsored election.  At Headquarters, a handbook on multidimensional peacekeeping operations is being finalized, which features a key chapter on gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping, as well as best practices and lessons learned from mission experiences. In addition, in collaboration with the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues (OSAGI), we are developing specific guidelines for different elements of peacekeeping operations on mainstreaming gender issues, and monitoring and evaluating the outcomes. Lastly, I should like to reiterate that the Secretary-General maintains a zero-tolerance policy on the engagement of peacekeepers in acts of sexual exploitation, harassment, and trafficking of women and girls. We urge troop- and police-contributing countries to take appropriate disciplinary, and if needed, criminal action against a national who commits such acts. For its part, the Department is improving preventive measures and strengthening its policies and procedures for disciplinary action against anyone accused of being involved in such unacceptable acts. Our training material and the admission programmes are being revised to place particular emphasis on this point.  Furthermore, through collaborations with United Nations and national partners, and by the deployment of HIV-AIDS policy officers in four field missions, United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE), United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) and United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), we are developing and implementing strategies to reduce transmission of HIV-AIDS.  Much of the progress we have achieved to date in our missions in East Timor, Kosovo, Bosnia- Herzegovina, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sierra Leone is in large part due to the presence of full-time gender advisers. They make a real difference in ensuring that all parts of an operation are made aware of the gender dimensions of their work, beginning first by speaking to the women of the country concerned, who are best placed to set the agenda in a way that is sensitive to local traditions and context.  Gender advisers offer suggestions on practical steps to address gender concerns in a manner appropriate to each unique mission circumstance and, consequently, significantly enhance our ability to implement resolution 1325 (2000). While much has been done to date, far more remains to be done, both in the field and at Headquarters.  In conclusion, much of what I have said about the importance of gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping may seem self-evident today. Yet the fact that a few years ago these same ideas may not have been understood as clearly is a testament to the ability of Council debate to alter our thinking and approach.  Put simply, the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) has precipitated a change in perceptions and it is natural that this process of change can sometimes be slow, face setbacks and scepticism. Inevitably, however, misguided cynicism will be overtaken by the facts. It is only a matter of time.  ",
    " First of all, I would like to say a very big thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership in this area, and also a big thank you to all members of the Security Council. We appreciate all the comments that you have made on the whole area of women, peace and security, and all the support that you have given me for my work at the ground level.  We definitely welcome the opportunity to strengthen our collaboration, especially at the field level. In this regard, I would like to acknowledge the progress that has been made, especially in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) on the ground. In fact, our experience has been that DPKO, in the areas where it has gender advisors, has been able to leverage the support of women by drawing on the strength of UNIFEM. Therefore, a very good example has been in East Timor, where we both participated in the training of women, and got women elected on a platform to deal with violence against women, and also of support to the police in order to protect women. So we were extremely pleased with that kind of work at the ground level.  This discussion has been an excellent basis for the preparation of our October session, and the report of the Secretary-General and the independent assessments will touch on many new areas of action that have been identified. There is a huge expectation. As many Council members have noted, Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) is a living document, something women will pay attention to and build upon.  The women's movement has celebrated the kind of thoughtfulness and receptivity the Security Council has given to this whole area of work. I will be in touch with them to convey the messages discussed here. We look forward to many of the initiatives discussed by Chile and Colombia on small arms. I also would like to share with you the fact that the Minister for Women's Affairs from Afghanistan will be here tomorrow to visit us, and there will be a signing of a memorandum of understanding with UNIFEM. The leadership of Afghan women shows strongly how the United Nations system has been working together.  A specific strength of UNIFEM. is working with women to prepare them for the peace table and train them to participate in the reconstruction of their countries. This is true from the Congo to the Manu River. The strength of the Women's Fund is in building women's capacity and the different kinds of leadership that will bring women to the peace table. In Afghanistan, UNIFEM. was very central to pulling together an agenda on women that was discussed at the Loya Jirga.  I would like to stress the link between the Secretary-General's report and the independent assessment. There is a division of labour between Ms. King and the work of UNIFEM. All of us participate in Ms. King's inter-agency task force. The division of labour is such that the independent expert assessment captures the voices of women at the ground level, and also the work in new areas that would not be captured by a desk review. That is the connection, but we hope both studies will become part of the Secretary- General's report.  I would like to end by saying UNIFEM. is a small fund, but we have invested $14 million in the area of women, peace and security. This investment has gone into four areas of work. One is early warning and prevention, using women's groups on the ground to help us. The second area is protection and assistance, in strong partnership with different agencies such as the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, UNICEF and women's groups. The third and largest area of women's work and the work of UNIFEM. has been in the area of peace-building, getting women from the ground and communities to the peace table. The fourth is gender justice, especially in post-conflict peace-building. As we move forward, we all realize that this area is actually the first step. We look forward to a long-term partnership with the members of the Security Council, so that implementation will make the kind of transformation necessary to ensure peace and security in women's lives.  ",
    " I would like to thank you, Sir, for allowing me the opportunity again to address the Council under your presidency and, in particular, to speak on behalf of the Australian delegation on this very important topic. We also greatly appreciate the personal introduction by the Secretary-General of his report.  Two years after the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), no one can seriously question how central gender issues are to preventing and resolving conflict and to rebuilding communities after conflict. At a time when too many resolutions and statements languish on shelves, that is no small achievement. The study on women, peace and security - a large measure of the funding for which Australia was pleased to provide - and the Secretary-General's report on the study maintain the momentum of resolution 1325 (2000) and are both to be welcomed.  The detailed information contained in those two documents should leave us in no doubt that, if we are serious about conflict resolution, we must be serious about gender perspectives on conflict. Gender perspectives are neither marginal nor optional; they cannot and should not be an afterthought. Rather, new patterns of conflict, and the fact that women and girls are too often the chief victims of conflict, mean that gender is central to much that this Council and United Nations peacekeeping operations do.  The recommendations and the presentation of facts in the study and the Secretary-General's report speak for themselves. Together with the complementary study produced under the auspices of United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), they provide us with a valuable and sensible guide to how we can further implement resolution 1325 (2000) and how we can ensure that women's and girls' perspectives are systematically incorporated into all of our efforts to preserve and restore peace.  I would like to highlight two of the many important observations of the studies. The first is that pre-conflict inequities and disregard for women's rights become worse during conflict. Indeed, such inequities, and in particular the lack of empowerment and participation on the part of women, reduce the capacity of communities to avoid conflict. A clear focus on empowering women before conflicts break out, therefore, should be a key element of a strategy of conflict prevention - which, after all, should be our primary objective.  Secondly, we need to see women as important contributors to peace and not simply as victims of conflict. We must be diligent and creative in giving women a role in peace processes. Here, the Council can play an important leadership role, particularly in designing its mandates and ensuring that the necessary resources are made available to ensure the fulfilment of those mandates. The experience of our region - the Solomon Islands, Bougainville and East Timor - gives ample testimony to the vital difference that women can make to the course of a conflict. I shall not go into the details of those regional experiences here, as they are set out in the written text of my statement. They are also discussed in the statement by the representative of Fiji, who spoke on behalf of the Pacific Island Forum group of countries.  I should say, however, that Australia's development cooperation programme recognizes the social and gender dimensions of conflict, and therefore supports the goal of increasing women's participation in decision-making and their access to and control over resources. It is working to ensure that women play an equal role in political structures and in community decision-making.  In June this year Australia launched its peace, conflict and development policy. The policy provides a framework for improving the ability of our development cooperation programme to address conflict and instability. This means there will be a greater emphasis on conflict prevention and peace- building, alongside the aid programme's more traditional missions of humanitarian relief and reconstruction. Given the importance of ensuring the active engagement of women in peace-building processes, the development cooperation programme will improve the integration of gender principles into all aid responses.  In future, we will also support those elements of society which work for the peaceful resolution of disputes and grievances. The role that women can play as peace-builders will be a particular focus, and we look forward to continuing to contribute to this very important issue.  ",
    " New Zealand commends the United Nations for its recognition of the linkages between gender equity and the realization of peace and security. The Security Council debate almost two years ago, resulting in resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security, was a milestone. That resolution expressed concern about the adverse impact of armed conflict on women and girls as civilians, refugees and internally displaced persons. The resolution promoted the role of women in preventing conflicts and in peacemaking and advocated that a gender perspective be mainstreamed into United Nations peacekeeping operations and that there should be greater involvement of women in such operations.  New Zealand was pleased financially to support the Secretary-General's study on the impact of armed conflict on women and girls that resulted from that resolution. New Zealand has participated in the group of friends of resolution 1325 (2000) and in the expert group meeting hosted by Canada to consider the best means to implement the resolution.  In our own region, we are particularly aware of the impact of armed conflict on women and of the very constructive role that women can play in the peace process and in the rebuilding of society. Earlier speakers have referred to scepticism on this issue. But we know, for example, that, as my Australian colleague has just pointed out, women were instrumental in bringing to an end the secessionist crisis from 1989 to 1998 in Bougainville. And in the Solomon Islands, women's groups recently helped develop the momentum towards peace. Women literally took to the streets calling for an end to ethnic conflict between Gwale and Malaitans.  We were impressed by the commitment of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) to implementing resolution 1325 (2000) in East Timor. Not only did UNTAET make sure that its staff integrated gender issues into its work, it actively collected data and information about the situation of East Timorese women and ensured that East Timorese women had a say on issues of importance to them. UNTAET's report notes, however, that it is important for the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) that Member States increase the number of women in the military and civilian police forces serving in peacekeeping operations. We are pleased to note that 461 women - more than 10 per cent of the total - have played an active role as part of the New Zealand peacekeeping force in East Timor.  Finally, I welcome the opportunity of this debate to underline the fundamental importance of achieving gender equity for the maintenance of peace and security and of enabling women to participate in the decision-making process.  ",
    " It was an important breakthrough when the Council adopted resolution 1325 (2000) and included women, peace and security on its agenda. That resolution provides us with an instrument to ensure the full and equal participation of women at all levels of decision-making and in promoting peace efforts, including conflict prevention and resolution and post-conflict reconstruction.  I commend you, Mr. President, and the United Kingdom presidency for organizing this meeting. It is clearly important that the Security Council actively follow up resolution 1325 (2000) and its implementation. I want to thank Angela King for her leadership in preparing the study on women, girls, peace and security, and Jean-Marie Guehenno and Noeleen Heyzer for their important contributions. I am pleased to learn that recommendations for future action have been identified during the work on the study. We are looking forward to being able to closely examine the study and the report of the Secretary-General. The recommendations will be crucial for further progress in this field.  During the spring of this year several Arias formula meetings were held to provide members of the Security Council with information and views on the status of women in war-affected areas. We heard accounts of horrifying human rights breaches and abuse. Despite the many bleak stories, it must be stressed that women must not be viewed only as victims of crime and abuse. Women are peacemakers and peace builders and it is of the utmost importance that they be included at all levels of peace planning and in efforts to maintain peace in a post-conflict situation.  Norway has actively supported strengthening of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) with regard to gender issues. I regret that the gender adviser posts previously proposed by DPKO were not given needed support. We continue to believe that these posts are necessary and hope the study will contain a recommendation to include gender advisers in DPKO.  We also look forward to revision of the standard operating procedures to include gender perspectives. Policy- and decision makers need to pay attention to gender-based differences. We recommend that gender focal points be established in all United Nations mandated operations and that gender awareness be included in training packages intended for peacekeeping personnel. Also, more efforts should be made to seek out women candidates and promote women to positions, both in peace missions and as special representatives of the Secretary-General.  I also hope the forthcoming recommendations will include practical and detailed mechanisms to ensure accountability for gender mainstreaming. Implementation remains the most challenging part of this work, and efforts should be made to develop practical tools and training.  In conclusion, I take this opportunity to suggest that a guidance note on gender perspectives be prepared which details issues that should be included in reports to the Security Council.  ",
    " At the outset, I should like to pay tribute to you, Sir, Ambassador John D. Negroponte, for convening this meeting on the third anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security. I should also like to extend my appreciation to Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno, Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, and Ms. Amy Smythe for sharing with the Council their insightful observations regarding the implementation of the resolution.  The ultimate goal of the international community, and therefore of the United Nations, is to build a world free of conflict. By adopting that resolution three years ago, the Security Council showed its wisdom by fully recognizing the important role played by women and girls in the process of building and maintaining peace and security. As a country striving to do its utmost in the areas of conflict prevention and post-conflict peace-building, Japan fully supports this resolution and will intensify its efforts to implement it. Empowering women is one of the key elements of enhancing peace and security.  Allow me to share with the Council some modest but practical steps that Japan has taken in this regard. In Afghanistan, we remember that under the Taliban regime, women were denied access to education and work outside their homes. For a country in a reconstruction process, such as Afghanistan, Japan is convinced that the participation of women is absolutely essential, and thus a gender perspective is taken into account in all aspects of Japan's reconstruction and humanitarian assistance programmes for Afghanistan. For example, the Japan International Cooperation Agency sent experts on gender issues to the Ministry of Women's Affairs, to the sector responsible for the rehabilitation of women's schools and colleges and to the mother and child healthcare hospital. Japan provides the United Nations Development Fund for Women with assistance through the Trust Fund for Human Security. That assistance finances vocational training, seminars, and income-generating programmes for female Afghan refugees and displaced persons. We believe that such programmes help to empower women and girls and encourage them to assume more active roles in Afghanistan.  Allow me to share with the Council another example of the efforts Japan is making. In February last year, the Government of Japan dispatched a Ground Self-Defence Forces engineer group of 680 members, together with 10 headquarters personnel, to the United Nations peacekeeping operation in Timor- Leste. For the first time in our history, Japan included female personnel in that large peacekeeping unit. Seven women were members of the group, a relatively small number but significant nonetheless, we believe. Japan recognizes the need for expanding the roles and contributions of women in United Nations field-based operations and indeed for increasing the participation of women at all levels. We are starting by doing what we can but have every intention of broadening and increasing our efforts.  On this third anniversary, I reaffirm the commitment of my delegation to the implementation of the provisions of the Council's resolution on women and peace and security; my delegation condemns the violations of the human rights of women and girls in conflict situations, wherever they occur.  We are all aware that women experience conflict in different ways than men. In a conflict situation, women are often widows grieving the loss of their husbands, mothers who mourn their lost children and victims of violence that targets their gender. Today, however, women's roles are changing in every aspect, and more women have a say in how they will participate in conflict resolution. More women can participate not only by providing non-military support but also by assuming important roles in peace-building if they so wish.  In order to provide an effective response to the challenging needs and priorities of women and girls who take on this range of tasks, gender perspectives have to be more systematically integrated into all activities related to peace and security. There is still much to be done in this regard. Japan hopes that the Security Council, Member States, the United Nations system - including the offices within the Secretariat responsible for these issues - non-governmental organizations and civil society as a whole will all do everything in their power to fully and systematically implement the recommendations of this resolution.  To conclude, may this discussion be a demonstration of the firm commitment of the entire international community to achieving the goal of creating a world of peace and security.  ",
    " My delegation thanks you, Sir, for having organized this meeting and for having included the item on women, peace and security on the Council's agenda during your presidency. This testifies to the interest you attach to this issue and gives us hope that, under your wise guidance, our debates will lead to positive results.  We welcome the presence here of Ms. Angela King, Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, and assure her of our readiness to engage in active cooperation with her Office. My delegation also listened with great interest to the statements made by Ms. Amy Smythe and Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno.  Commemorating the third anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) provides us with an opportunity to assess accomplishments, carefully to consider the challenges ahead and to find new approaches to its implementation. At the Council's public meeting of 28 October 2002, my delegation, while encouraging the Secretariat to strengthen its cooperation, particularly urged the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to pursue their consideration of the participation of women in those operations.  My delegation welcomes the valuable information provided to us today by Ms. Smythe and notes that inter-State conflicts have given rise to a new kind of violence, with particularly disastrous consequences for vulnerable individuals, in particular women, children and the elderly.  In that connection, the participation of civilians in armed combat - including women - the illegal use of small arms and the failure to respect international law, and international humanitarian law in particular, are among the factors having a negative impact on the lives of vulnerable individuals, especially women and girls. That is why my delegation welcomed the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), which was the result of a lengthy process and which represents a step forward for the international community.  We welcome that achievement, and believe that the following effects emanating from the resolution's adoption most eloquently illustrate the international community's commitment to the process of implementing the resolution. Those effects include, among others, the establishment of groups of friends of the resolution, the Secretary-General's submission of a report on the subject, the efforts of various members of the international community at all levels, the reference to this issue in 33 out of the 225 resolutions adopted between October 2000 and 1 October 2003, the initiative by the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Development Fund for Women on the role of women in exchanging weapons for development, the drafting by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees of a code of conduct to combat sexual abuse in refugee camps, the establishment of the post of Gender Adviser within the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the establishment of similar posts in several missions and the publication of a study by the Office of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women.  The varying experiences acquired highlight the impact of conflict on women and girls, their participation in combat and their involvement in conflict-resolution and peace-building processes. We should also note the importance of issues concerning national and international legal frameworks, as well as the participation of women in peacekeeping operations.  While we welcome the progress that has been made, my delegation also believes that there is a need to continue to join efforts to further advance the implementation of the resolution. In doing so there is not only a need to coordinate the efforts of various actors, but also for them to share their experiences. The United Nations system has a fundamental role to play in that regard.  My delegation, which is prepared to make its modest contribution to that process, would once again like to cite the example of the women of West Africa, and in particular that of the women of the Mano River Union region, who, despite numerous difficulties, are continuing their active involvement in the conflict- resolution and peace-building processes. It is in that context that the Guinean branch of the Network of African Women Ministers and Parliamentarians (REFAMP) organized a subregional conference in Conakry from 24 to 26 January 2000 on the subject of the prevention and resolution of conflicts. In order to maintain that momentum and to follow up on the recommendations of the subregional consultative meeting on strengthening the participation of women in the establishment of peace, held in Addis Ababa from 23 to 25 April 2001, the Secretariat's Division for the Advancement of Women, in collaboration with the Centre for Conflict Resolution of Cape Town, South Africa, and the Government of Guinea, organized a training workshop in Conakry from 20 to 25 October 2002 on conflict management by women.  Those examples eloquently attest to the vital role played by the women of Guinea in seeking and strengthening peace in the subregion, and in particular in the countries of the Mano River Union. They are tirelessly working in various assistance activities on behalf of refugees and displaced persons, and especially on behalf of women and girls in distress. The international community should strengthen their determination to overcome every challenge and support the initiatives that have been undertaken.  My delegation believes that, despite the unique nature of the issue of women in armed conflict, there is a need to widen our thinking on this issue as part of the broader context of protecting civilians in armed conflict. The aide-memoire and road map now being finalized in that connection will serve as a point of reference in doing so.  In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that conflict prevention and resolution, peace-building and the establishment of new democratic forms of governance must be based on the active participation of women in all activities and at every level. It is for that reason that I hope that today's debate will lead to specific commitments that will in fact be followed up.  Finally, on behalf of my country, allow me to condemn the deadly attacks that recently took place in Iraq. I would also like to convey our condolences to the bereaved families, including innocent women and girls and those involved in the work of reconstruction.  ",
    " I wish to thank Mr. Guehenno for his comprehensive and informative briefing and also to underscore his personal interest in and commitment to this issue.  Let me begin by emphasizing a fact mentioned earlier by other speakers. Regrettably, recent decades have witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of women victims of armed conflict. It is estimated that today approximately 90 per cent of the victims of war are civilians, most of them women and children, which was not the case a century ago. It is true that, from the international standpoint, many measures have been taken relating to the treatment of crimes against women. Rape has thus been included in the list of crimes against humanity under the statutes of the courts relating to the former Yugoslavia and to Rwanda; the International Criminal Court has included a gender perspective in its definition of crimes; and the Beijing Conference reiterated the commitment of the international community to eradicate crimes against women in armed conflict.  Although those developments are a source of hope, much remains to be done. The decisive role that women can play in peace processes must also be taken into account.  My delegation is aware of the fact that, along with international commitments, a strategy is required that would ensure women's participation at the national level in the settlement of disputes and in the promotion of a culture of peace. However, measures must also be taken to promote the participation of women in all conflict-prevention and conflict-resolution processes.  In this connection, my country has expanded  women's participation as observers in electoral processes throughout the world and as participants in post-conflict reconstruction processes. Spanish military contingents participating in peace operations include increasing numbers of women. Moreover, Spain deems it particularly important in this respect for the media to play an important role in pre- and post-conflict periods, both nationally and internationally.  All of this confirms the fact that, in addition to the commitment of the international community, domestic measures must also be adopted so that, together with Governments, civil society as a whole and non-governmental organizations can make valuable contributions to the two key aspects of women's participation in peace-building: on the one hand, by protecting women who are the victims of conflict, and, on the other, by promoting the participation of women in the building of a culture of peace. This work cannot be done without the necessary coordination within the United Nations system to fulfil the important commitments entered into in resolution 1325 (2000), adopted three years ago.  ",
    " I thank you, Ambassador Negroponte, for organizing this open debate on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). Allow me to begin by commending you, Sir, on the most appropriate manner in which you have chosen to steer the debate to mark the third anniversary of that historic resolution. The focus on implementation, I believe, is both timely and necessary. Since the adoption of the resolution, the Security Council has held a number of open debates to reaffirm its commitment to charting a definitive place for gender perspectives on its ongoing agenda. Thanks to that commitment, it is now widely accepted that the concerns of women and girls must be actively addressed in matters of conflict resolution and peace- building.  Marking the second anniversary of the resolution last year, the Secretary-General's report (S\/2002\/ 1154) offered a comprehensive set of recommendations for doing so, and the Council adopted a presidential statement (S\/PRST\/2002\/32) incorporating many of the recommendations into a call for action on the part of the Council, the Secretary-General and Member States. The task now is to ensure their full and continuing implementation.  In this regard, I am grateful for the presentation made by Under-Secretary-General Guehenno on the work undertaken by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to implement Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and that of Ms. Amy Smythe on her experiences in the field as Senior Gender Adviser to the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They have clearly outlined the progress made thus far as well as the challenges that remain in implementation.  The Republic of Korea welcomes the progress made by the Secretariat at Headquarters and in the field. We are encouraged that gender specialists are now assigned to 10 United Nations peacekeeping missions and are backed up and coordinated by a Gender Adviser at the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO). We also commend the progress made to provide gender perspectives training to staff in peacekeeping operations. We know and appreciate that much of the push for the progress was provided by the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, led by Ms. Angela King.  We encourage the Secretariat to keep up the efforts towards the full completion of these measures. We also see that references to gender issues are included in DPKO reports to the Council. We would have liked to see great detail and elaboration in those references. We hope the substance will be provided in future reports of missions as well as when the Secretary-General presents his next report on the issue to the Council in 2004.  In the meantime, we strongly encourage the collection of data related to peace operations, desegregated by gender and age. For policies to be effective, they must accurately reflect the situation on the ground, where the experience of conflict and peace- building remains very different for men than for women and for different ages.  We also note the lack of progress in other areas. There has been no meaningful increase in the number of women appointed as special representatives and envoys of the Secretary-General. In any case, the appointment of women to high-profile tasks and gender specialists to peace missions would be just the beginning. Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) calls for the full integration of gender perspectives and the increased participation of women in peace processes, peacekeeping, humanitarian operations and rehabilitation and reconstruction programmes, and, further, in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration.  The Republic of Korea hopes that the investment of personnel, expertise and training by the United Nations will serve as a catalyst in getting all actors on board, including parties to armed conflicts, for materializing the full vision of Security Council resolution 1325 (2005). In the process, the continuing willingness of the Council to incorporate a gender perspective into peacekeeping operations will be instrumental as it compliments and reinforces the work of other bodies of the United Nations in strengthening the role of women as active agents of change in times of both peace and conflict.  ",
    " I would like to express the Pakistani delegation's appreciation to you for convening this open debate to mark the third anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). The resolution elevated women from being hapless victims of conflict situations to equal stakeholders in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in the rehabilitation of post conflict situations. Today's meeting provides us with an opportunity to review the progress and to advance the implementation of this resolution.  Human rights instruments - particularly the Geneva Conventions - proscribe torture, violence, rape and other forms of sexual violence and ill- treatment of women during conflicts. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court pronounces these acts in the context of armed conflict as crimes against humanity. These injunctions notwithstanding, women's suffering in conflict situations has continued. Despite growing awareness of their plight and increased focus on their protection, women continue to be the prime victims of calamities - both natural and man-made - in conflict situations.  Mention has been made here of the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Afghanistan and other places. You will understand if I, on my part, address specifically the plight of women in a conflict that affects a people who are close to the hearts of the Pakistani people.  The suffering of women in the ongoing freedom struggle in Jammu and Kashmir is symbolic of the suffering of women worldwide. The Indian army uses rape in this deeply conservative society as a weapon to punish, intimidate, coerce, humiliate and degrade Kashmiri women. Investigations by human rights groups into allegations of gang rape by the Indian security forces show that it has been used routinely in search-and-cordon operations. There is generally a pattern of impunity and non-accountability when it comes to incidents of rape or violence. Investigations are more a cover-up than an inquiry.  Human rights organizations have testified that in J ammu and Kashmir, since 1992, rape and ill-treatment of women are usually reported to have taken place during counter-insurgency operations by Indian forces. The Asia Watch and Physicians for Human Rights have documented the extensive use of rape by the occupation forces designed to punish and humiliate the entire community. Amnesty International has reported that harassment, abduction, rape and deliberate and arbitrary killings perpetrated by pro-Indian renegades in Kashmir are also carried out with the support of the Indian security forces.  We would hope that, like other peacekeeping operations mentioned by Mr. Guehenno, the United Nations Military Observer Group for India and Pakistan will also be tasked to report to the Security Council on the conditions of women in occupied Jammu and Kashmir. The implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), like other resolutions of the Security Council, cannot be promoted on a selective and discriminatory basis.  There are thousands of destitute women in Kashmir, illustrating this manifestation of a brutal conflict. They include women who have been widowed, or whose husbands have been maimed, or who have disappeared, or those who are in arbitrary detention. We urge the United Nations and non- governmental organizations (NGOs) to prepare a survey of the number of such destitute Kashmiri women. The international community should take appropriate measures to provide help and compensation to these women.  We urge the humanitarian agencies, especially the International Committee of the Red Cross, to act as the instrument and avenue for such relief distribution. Political considerations and the power of certain countries should not stand in the way of international humanitarian agencies responding to the plight of the Kashmiri women and children suffering from the long and bloody conflict that has been inflicted on their homeland.  Unfortunately, such crimes against women do not remain limited to situations of armed conflicts. A pattern of targeted violence against women in situations of communal disturbance within national borders has also been witnessed. Very little is said of last year's anti-Muslim violence in the Indian state of Gujarat, which saw abhorrent illustration of the crimes against women. The report of Human Rights Watch has extensively documented these crimes, which included gang rape, burning women alive, other methods of murder and the murder of unborn babies. In Afghanistan, where the destitution of women was a pervasive consequence of two decades of conflict, violence against women has been used as a tool to terrorize populations, force displacement and demoralize adversaries.  By adopting resolution 1325 (2000), the Security Council reaffirmed its deep concern at such violence against women in armed conflict. It also acknowledged women's possible positive contribution in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in post- conflict consolidation and rehabilitation. The need to mainstream a gender perspective into peacekeeping has been affirmed.  We thank Under-Secretary-General Guehenno for his briefing on the Department of Peacekeeping Operations' efforts to implement resolution 1325 (2000) in United Nations peacekeeping missions. We also thank Ms. Amy Smythe, Senior Gender Adviser to the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), for sharing with us her experience in the implementation of the resolution. These two presentations to the Council give us an insight into the normative and operational implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  The best way to protect women from the scourge of armed conflict is to prevent and resolve conflicts. The Security Council, as the organ of the United Nations responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security, must strengthen its capacity to prevent such conflicts and to resolve them. We must also stress the observance and implementation of the principles of international humanitarian law and human rights in international conflicts.  We believe the Council must not only ensure prompt and effective responses to crisis situations, irrespective of their geographical locations, but also avoid selectivity in the implementation of its resolutions. We need greater international solidarity, responsibility and respect for the collective decisions of the United Nations and the determination to implement them. The Charter contains provisions, including in Chapter VI, which can be utilized for the purpose of promoting implementation of Council resolutions.  At last year's open meeting of the Council to discuss women and armed conflict, my delegation suggested a few measures for the Council's consideration, which we believe are still valid and applicable.  The first is adopting a declaration that the targeting of women - especially the use of rape as an instrument of war - will be considered a war crime, susceptible to national and international punishment.  The second is initiating a study of recent and ongoing conflict situations to identify crimes committed against women, with a view to seeking redress and compensation for the victims.  The third is requiring current and future United Nations peacekeeping operations to monitor, and report regularly to the Security Council, on the situation of women and girls in their mission areas.  The fourth is promoting the fullest possible participation by women in peace processes as well in post-conflict peace-building, including in the reintegration, reconstruction and rehabilitation of societies in post-conflict phases.  The fifth is requiring United Nations specialized organs and agencies to develop ways to address the special needs of women and girls affected by conflict, including health and psychological care.  The sixth is the Security Council's involving other United Nations bodies as well as representatives of civil society - perhaps using the Arria Formula - in a comprehensive discussion to promote such recommendations and actions.  We believe that those actions should be undertaken in the Security Council's follow-up to resolution 1325 (2000).  ",
    " I thank you, Sir, for holding this open debate of the Security Council on gender and peacekeeping to mark the third anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security. I also wish to thank the senior United Nations personnel who have provided us with valuable introductions to the topic at hand.  The critical importance of this issue stems from the fact that civilians are increasingly the victims, sometimes unintended and sometimes intended, of the violent conflicts that occur in different parts of the world today. It has been estimated that close to 90 per cent of current war casualties are civilians, the majority of whom are women and children, compared to a century ago, when 90 per cent of those who lost their lives were military personnel. Although entire communities suffer the consequences of armed conflict, women and children are particularly affected because of their status in society and their gender.  Despite this, women should not be viewed solely as victims of war. They assume the key role of ensuring family livelihoods in the midst of chaos and destruction, and are particularly active in peace movements at the grassroots level and in cultivating peace within their communities. However, the absence of women at the peace-negotiating table is unconscionable.  My delegation supported many of the recommendations made in the report of the Secretary- General (S\/2002\/ 1154) pursuant to resolution 1325 (2000). We welcome, in that context, the decision to appoint a gender adviser in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.  Armed and other types of conflicts, terrorism and hostage-taking still persist in many parts of the world. My country has been the victim of a vicious campaign of cross-border terrorism for two decades, resulting in the deaths of at least 63,000 persons, mainly civilians, women and children included. On 27 October, two days ago, the first day of Ramadan, one person was killed and 34 were injured in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir when a grenade was indiscriminately lobbed into a public telecommunications centre where people were lined up to pay their bills. The campaign of terrorism and intimidation seeking to force itself on an unwilling citizenry in the state of Jammu and Kashmir has been compounded by the misguided zealotry of the fundamentalists who have launched a terror campaign specifically targeting women for their so-called non- observance of strict moral codes. In an area where society has traditionally placed no such restrictions on women and in which women have played such an important role, the externally-foisted and forced imposition of such social codes can only impact adversely on society in general and on women in particular.  It is our experience that terrorists exploit the vulnerabilities of women in situations where violence prevails and where normal life and livelihoods are disrupted on account of terrorist activities. Perhaps those that direct and sponsor terrorist activities are aware that women, having the most vested interests in ensuring a stable and peaceful society, foster values that go against violence and terrorism.  Moreover, when provided the opportunity to mobilize themselves through democratic processes, women have been at the forefront of initiatives for the consolidation of peace and security. One consistent factor in democratic elections in different parts of India has been the preponderance of women among voters. The success of elections in Jammu and Kashmir last year can be partly attributed to the high turnout of Kashmiri women desirous of utilizing this democratic exercise to empower themselves with the means for producing a more secure and stable environment. It is implicit that their participation would also foster and strengthen activities that combat terrorism.  In Afghanistan, women are finding their rightful place in society. The violence of the gun has largely given way to a more peaceful and settled existence for a large part of the population. An entire generation of women who were denied their right to education and work by those represented by the Taliban are now pursuing educational and professional opportunities. Unfortunately, the same religious fundamentalists have now diverted their attention to other parts of the world, including the Indian state of J ammu and Kashmir.  India recently undertook the largest democratic decentralization exercise when it provided grassroots level panchayats - locally elected self-governing bodies - across the country, with decision-making powers. Since at least one-third of all panchayat members in India are women by statutory law, that decision has opened up the opportunity to Indian women to lead on peace and security issues from the grassroots level. Undoubtedly, women having a voice in inculcating systems that foster peace and security in a country of a billion people will have an impact far and wide.  Women and children constitute some 80 per cent of the world's millions of refugees and other displaced persons. They are threatened by the deprivation of property, goods, services and their right to return to their homes of origin, and by violence and insecurity. We therefore support the Secretary-General's recommendation that the reintegration of women through disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes be an integral part of all future peacekeeping missions.  The debate today has provided a valuable  opportunity for the Council and the larger membership to be updated on and further sensitized to the important role that women can and should play in securing peace and international security. It is incumbent upon the United Nations to play its role in supporting and furthering efforts in that direction. We support the implementation of the Secretary-General's recommendations, although, as with all broad recommendations, this must be conditional upon circumstances and situations.  The representative of Pakistan has, in his wisdom, chosen to make unwarranted and unsubstantiated comments on the treatment of women in India. I have earlier drawn the attention of the Council to the invaluable role the political empowerment of women can play in inculcating values that serve as a deterrent to violence and terrorism. The stark contrast between Indian and Pakistani politics, seen in their historical and current contexts, can offer no better evidence of the differing political, legal and social frameworks within which each country views its women as a resource in addressing the issue of peace and security.  Early this month, in an open letter, dated 10 October 2003 addressed to the President of Pakistan, the Executive Director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch devoted one entire section to legal discrimination against and mistreatment of women and religious minorities in that country. The letter also addresses, inter alia, the issues of the torture and mistreatment of political opponents and journalists, return to civilian rule and the legal framework order and sectarian violence. The letter specifically records that inaction on the Hudood laws persists despite the Government-run National Commission for Status of Women calling for a repeal of the Hudood Ordinance on the grounds that it \"makes a mockery of Islamic justice\" and is \"not based on Islamic injunctions.\" This, despite the outcry over cases such as the tribal jirga-ordered gang-rape of Mukhtaran Bibi in Punjab and the sentencing to death by stoning of Zafran Bibi on grounds of adultery. Human Rights Watch has monitored those and other cases involving abuse under the Hudood laws. Informed estimates suggest that over 210,000 cases under the Hudood laws are under process in Pakistan's legal system.  The aforementioned is just an illustration of the problems that women in that country face. A State that is unable and unwilling to provide basic rights to its women is incapable of any sensitivity towards the plight of women in other countries brought about by terrorist actions. Conversely, it reveals the ethos - under which the sponsors of the regressive Taliban in Afghanistan have decided to use similar means to subdue a civilian population, particularly women and children, of another nation into succumbing to the threat of terror.  ",
    " I would like to underscore the fact that women in conflict are not merely victims, but active agents. I thank members for recognizing that fact. I would also like, on behalf of Ms. Vaweka, one of our closest partners and a role model for the women of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to thank members for recognizing the good work that she is doing.  I would like specifically to respond to the question from France concerning the relationship between the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) and the Congolese Administration, especially the Government Ministry for what is known as la condition feminine, which could, perhaps, be translated as the Ministry for Women and Family, as well as the Ministry for Women and Human Rights. Indeed, the gender unit has established contact with the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and we have had informal discussions and are trying to sensitize the Government on the whole issue of gender integration in every aspect of its work.  We have been holding discussions with the new Minister for la condition feminine, planning a specific activity in relation to the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence, from 25 November to 10 December. We plan to use that as a strategy, in collaboration with the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), which has always accompanied women in decision-making since the time of the inter-Congolese dialogue. We plan to use that as a strategy to get the women and men of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to recognize the position of the new Minister. It is critical because she comes from an interesting area.  The Ministry responsible for the condition of women is trying to work internally among colleagues to sensitize the leadership on gender issues and to establish networks with agencies and interested parties to take the gender debate outside. We in the Gender Unit plan to work not only with that specific Ministry, but with all other ministries and Government agencies. We plan to carry out training programmes with the parliamentarians and the Senate and to work with the judiciary very closely.  We have been approached by other ministries. For example, we have been approached by the Ministry of Education and asked whether we could do some work with the universities. We are somewhat limited in terms of capacity, but we hope that in the near future, now that the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has a physical presence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, that, in the context of collaboration, we can do a little bit more than we have been doing.  We are very mindful of the fact that ours is a very small outfit, but we are working in close collaboration with the agencies that are there. Specifically, we have collaborated with the Ministry of Health, which took the lead recently on the issue of violence against women, again in collaboration with UNIFEM. In that context, we participated in the elaboration of an inter- agency project to deal with the issue of violence against women. Here I would stress that we are merely collaborating; it is a joint effort on the part of the agencies.  Our task as the gender ministry is to ensure that women's voices are factored into the process. We are working on the ground to find out about local initiatives and what women themselves have been doing, and then serving as the link with our colleagues in the various agencies to make sure that this is taken into consideration.  In summary, the gender ministry is working very closely with various ministries, not only directly but also in collaboration with agencies and with other sections and divisions of MONUC.  ",
    " First of all, let me thank you, Mr. President, for having organized this important open meeting marking the third anniversary of the historic resolution on women, peace and security, adopted during the Namibian presidency of the Council, with the participation of Ukraine, which was then a Council member. As has been mentioned, that document strengthened specifically the political legitimacy of women's struggle for a seat at the negotiating table, and provided a framework within which women's protection and their role in peace- building can be addressed.  I would like to express our appreciation to the Assistant Secretary-General and Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, Ms. Angela King, and all members of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Women, Peace and Security, as well as to the Under-Secretary-General, Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno, for their activities in promoting the coordination of efforts to implement resolution 1325 (2000).  Despite the progress made, however, issues of gender representation and gender perspectives have still not been systematically incorporated into all United Nations activities on peace and security.  During the past three years, the Security Council has increasingly focused its attention on the situation of women and girls in armed conflict. However, these issues have often been discussed as a separate item, rather than integrated into wider deliberations by the Council. In order to effectively respond to the needs and priorities of women and girls during armed conflict, in our View gender perspectives must be systematically integrated into all peace-building, peacekeeping and peacemaking efforts, as well as humanitarian operations and reconstruction processes.  Unfortunately, in today's conflicts, women and girls are increasingly targeted directly, and are threatened by rape, domestic violence, sexual exploitation, trafficking, sexual humiliation and mutilation. They are at heightened risk in all settings, whether at home, in flight or in camps for displaced persons. That is why we think that all humanitarian responses in conflict situations must include systematic reporting on sexual violence, emphasize the special reproductive health needs of women and girls and reflect a strengthened policy guidance on responses to gender-based violence and sexual exploitation.  It is important that the Rome Statute reflect ground-breaking developments in the criminalization of sexual and gender violence and the establishment of structures to ensure the effective investigation and prosecution of such crimes by the International Criminal Court. As such, the Rome Statute is the first treaty to recognize certain acts of sexual and gender violence as being among the most serious crimes under international law.  With regard to sexual violence, we should not forget one of its worst possible consequences - the risk of the transmission of HIV\/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. In our opinion, measures regarding an HIV\/AIDS response should be better reflected in United Nations peacekeeping operations. Ukraine has already incorporated HIV\/AIDS awareness training into the national training programmes for military personnel in preparation for deployment.  Although they are often victims of armed conflict, women cannot be considered merely as passive recipients who are incapable of taking charge of their own destiny. The international community should use the potential of women as agents of preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping and peace- building.  Recent years have witnessed the flowering and growth of a vibrant women's peace movement. From grass-roots activism to international networks and campaigns, women's organizations have brought new energy and focus to peace-building. Despite the obstacles and difficulties they face, many have had a positive impact on local and national peace processes. This can be noted in Liberia, Burundi and South Africa, as well as in the Middle East, the Balkans and South-East Asia, where, in their struggle for peace, women's networks bridge the dividing lanes of conflict, despite threats and abuse. The contributions made by the informal peace initiatives of local women's groups and networks should be recognized and supported by the world community.  Regional organizations also play an important role in protecting women and supporting their role in peace-building. In this context, I would like to draw attention to the initiatives of the Cooperation Forum of the Women of the GUAAM. countries- Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. The resolution adopted at the second meeting of that body, which took place in Kiev last year, contained a provision aimed at the creation of an international peace movement, entitled \"Women against violence, conflicts and wars\". The Forum also called upon the Secretary-General to use all of his power and authority to intensify efforts aimed at resolving existing armed conflicts and preventing the emergence of new ones.  In spite of the increasing information and knowledge surrounding women's experience of conflict, relatively little systematic documentation on their peace-building efforts is available. The work they do is still largely invisible to the eyes of the world's media and policy makers. Scepticism about women's contributions continue to hamper policy and programmatic developments aimed at supporting and enhancing women's participation. Perhaps as a result of this scepticism, today only one woman leads a United Nations peace mission. Our delegation supports the appeals of the Secretary-General and the Special Adviser on Gender Issues to Member States to act in proactive manner by identifying women to serve in senior decision-making positions and to increase their recruitment to military observer teams, peacekeeping contingents and civilian police units. A broad database of experienced women in peacekeeping and other relevant disciplines should be created. Eight female officers from my country already number among civilian police and military personnel, and we want that figure to increase.  We believe the Security Council has a special responsibility to support women's participation in peace processes by ensuring respective gender balance in United Nations peacekeeping missions. Finally, let me remind members of one of the greatest time-honoured customs of the peoples of the Caucasus. A woman could stop bloodshed just by throwing her scarf between the combatants. It is a centuries-old practice, but should we not sometimes heed the wisdom of our ancestors?  ",
    " The report of the Secretary-General makes it clear that, while significant progress has been made in several key areas in the past two years, there still remain vast gaps between the goals of resolution 1325 (2000) and its implementation.  My delegation appreciates the advances made in the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) in the area of peacekeeping. We are pleased to note that there are now full-time gender specialists in 10 of the 17 United Nations peacekeeping operations, supported and guided by the Gender Adviser at Headquarters in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.  We also commend the efforts that have been made by United Nations entities, Member States and civil society in training military, civilian police and civilian peacekeeping personnel on the protection of the rights and needs of women. But we underscore the Secretary-General's call for a more coherent strategy for strengthening understanding among all actors of the relevance of gender issues to peacekeeping. We also strongly support the development and implementation of recruitment strategies to increase women's participation in military, civilian police and peacekeeping operations.  My delegation fully subscribes to the View that post-conflict processes can offer societies emerging from conflict a new chance to recast social relations for the better. We therefore welcome the Secretary- General's finding that women's participation in post- conflict reconstruction has increased in recent years. We are particularly pleased to note the significant progress has been made in Afghanistan, where women were very much involved in the formulation of a new national constitution. Furthermore, we are heartened by the fact that 20 per cent of the seats in that country's new constitutional body are held by women. That dynamic is also in evidence in Rwanda, where constitutional set-asides and new elections have brought 49 per cent of the seats to women in the lower Parliament, which represents the highest proportion of women in parliaments worldwide.  However, we remain concerned that the majority of reconstruction efforts do not systematically include gender perspectives. Accordingly, we support the Secretary-General's call for systematic incorporation of gender perspectives in the planning, implementation and monitoring of all reconstruction programmes and budgets.  One of the terrible truths of modern warfare is that women and girls suffer at a level wholly disproportionate to their involvement in a given conflict. In particular, gender-based violence - including rape, sexual slavery and other forms of abuse - has been a shameful aspect of warfare in many conflicts around the world. The consequences have been tragic for millions of women and girls, as well as for the families, communities and societies they sustain.  We are troubled that the international community has not yet been able to prevent acts of violence against women during armed conflict. As the Secretary-General's report notes, sexual and gender- based violence have recently been reported in the Darfur region of the Sudan and in other countries in conflict or post-conflict situations. Clearly, we have a long way to go in eliminating that scourge upon humanity.  Nevertheless, we have hope in the positive developments in our uphill battle against gender-based violence. The special rapporteurs of the Commission on Human Rights, in particular the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, have played an important role in drawing attention to the vulnerability of women in recent conflicts. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda have broken new ground in the area of jurisprudence on sexual violence under international law. Most significantly, the establishment of the International Criminal Court, with jurisdiction over crimes against humanity - including rape, sexual slavery and other forms of sexual violence - promises to eliminate impunity for gender-based crimes against women in armed conflict.  That hope, however, will not automatically become reality. Member States must send strong signals to parties to armed conflicts that violations of women's human rights and gender-based violence will be met with severe punishment and sanctions. We must vigorously pursue and prosecute those who commit such criminal acts, and we must enhance the effectiveness of tribunals and justice mechanisms. The best way to prevent gender-based violence during wartime is to send a clear signal to would-be perpetrators that their crimes will not go unpunished. Furthermore, for countries emerging from conflict, the elaboration of a domestic legal system that provides effective ways to bring the perpetrators of gender- based crimes to justice would be important in the post- conflict peace-building process.  It has been four years since resolution 1325 (2000) was adopted. However, lack of protection for women and girls and violations of their human rights during armed conflict still persist. The Republic of Korea reaffirms its commitment to working bilaterally, multilaterally and through United Nations agencies to do our share for the full and effective implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  ",
    " The discussion of the report on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security is very important to the delegation of Guatemala, first of all, because our country has benefited from the United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA), which is mentioned by the Secretary- General in his report (S\/2004\/814) as one of the peace operations in which three women serve as deputy special representatives.  Secondly, in accordance with the recommendations of the Secretary-General to encourage the participation of women in peacekeeping operations, we take pride in the fact that Guatemala contributes women to peacekeeping operations. On this very day, a unit of 70 military police officers is leaving to join the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), a contingent that includes 5 women.  Regarding the work of MINUGUA, that mission worked side by side with Guatemala in a negotiating process that concluded with the signing of the peace agreements in 1996 and called for profound changes in our society with an agenda that the Government of Guatemala has adopted as a minimum. MINUGUA gave significant support towards improving the prevailing situation. Now it is incumbent on us, as Guatemalans, to build a fairer society that will overcome the exclusion, marginalization and discrimination that we have suffered, affecting not only the indigenous peoples but also women in particular.  In September of this year, MINUGUA inaugurated at United Nations Headquarters an exhibition of photography entitled, \"Guatemala - Images of Peace\", which, apart from demonstrating the mission's activities, also showed the great challenges that we must confront and overcome, including poverty and gender equality, which are two fundamental elements of resolution 1325 (2000) that we are now addressing.  Because of our experience and because we are a country that has emerged from an armed conflict that impoverished us for 36 years, Guatemala is convinced of the need to enhance the prevalence of women in the processes of decision-making and of the valuable contribution women make to the maintenance of international peace and security. An educated woman, free of discrimination and subjugation, is the best guarantee for achieving sustainable development and securing peaceful and harmonious social coexistence. For that reason, we urge the Security Council to establish and promote strategies and programmes to prevent gender-based violence. We also support the establishment of systems to protect victims and witnesses that bring charges of that kind of crime. In that regard, the Public Prosecutor's Office in Guatemala has an office of victim care - a unit which provides humanitarian assistance and comprehensive and urgent care in order to minimize the negative effects of the crime. We agree with the Secretary- General that the dissemination and exchange of information are vital in order to raise awareness of the contents of resolution 1325 (2000).  We congratulate the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) on creating a web site that offers a centralized database, and the United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW) for the work it has done in compiling information resources on gender-related aspects of conflicts and peace, as well as in managing the inter-agency task force on an electronic database of gender training materials. We believe there needs to be better coordination among Member States, United Nations agencies and civil society actors, so as to systematically mainstream the gender perspective and disseminate the content of resolution 1325 (2000) in terms of conflict prevention, planning peacekeeping operations and post-conflict peace-building, which cannot be successful or complete if women do not fully participate in them.  ",
    " I thank you, Sir, for the honour of addressing the Council on the important issue of women, peace and security, focusing on gender-based violence.  In times of conflict, violence against women becomes more than personal devastation; it becomes - as we have seen all too painfully in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Bosnia and today in Darfur - a means for the wholesale destruction of communities and peoples. The international community is now fully aware that rape and other forms of violence against women are systematically used as a weapon of war. And in many wars and conflicts, rape has been used as a way of humiliating the men of the other side, infecting women with HIV\/ AIDS, forcing them into sexual slavery and destroying women's ability to revitalize their communities.  What ultimately must we do to achieve justice and accountability for victims of gender-based violence? Impunity for gender crimes continues to prevail in post-conflict societies and will likely never be completely eliminated, given the shortcomings of international and national justice in dealing with sexual crimes. However, justice and accountability are critical to the healing and peace process. As we work towards ending impunity, it is important to ensure that those responsible for crimes against women are not rewarded with State power and high-profile jobs as a result of negotiated peace agreements. It is important to include women at the peace table and in the process of reconstruction. It is important to address the nature and root causes of violence against women.  Within the human rights framework, violence against women is recognized as a manifestation of deeply-rooted historical patterns of discrimination against women and of systemic gender inequalities. Seen in its true light, gender-based violence in times of conflict is part of the continuum of violence that runs through women's lives, from times of peace to times of war. It only deepens with war. In all cases, its origins lie in inequality. Gender inequality is, in fact, a seed that, in times of conflict, bears the bitter fruit of systematic campaigns to destroy the lives of women, families and communities.  The good news is that we now know so much about effective measures to eliminate violence against women. Great strides have been made in setting norms, standards and legal frameworks, and the challenge now is to ensure the implementation of the very good laws that many countries have already developed, working closely with and providing the necessary support for national players. Mechanisms for enforcing rights and redressing violations are critical to accountability and justice.  Legal reforms must be accompanied by the training and reform of the criminal justice system, which is not very sensitive to the needs of women victims. Some of the changes that have been made to the administration of justice - through the creation of specialized police stations, the training of police forces as a whole and partnerships with women's groups - must be instituted as broadly as possible. Coordinated community-level interventions must bring together men, local Government, traditional leaders, medical and legal professionals, and the leaders of women's organizations so that the framework of international and national laws can be firmly connected to women's lived realities.  We also know that violence must be dealt with at multiple levels and in multiple sectors of society simultaneously, and that the root causes of violence must be addressed, including women's poor economic, social and political status. Through the United Nations Trust Fund in Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence against Women, administered by the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), initiatives have been taken in all of those areas. Those initiatives hold the key to lives free of Violence for all women, but they need to be scaled up and adequately resourced to become standard practice in crisis and post-crisis situations.  At the end of the day, the root causes of violence must be addressed by enforcing women's rights and eliminating all forms of discrimination against women. Gender justice requires the integration of gender perspectives within every dimension of justice and the participation of women in shaping justice frameworks and rule of law institutions in ways that promote their human rights, legal equality and inclusion. It requires legal justice to address discriminatory laws against women, such as inheritance laws which prevent women from owning property. It requires justice to address violations of human rights and war crimes so that women can move beyond their trauma and begin to construct new lives for themselves. It requires economic and social justice to address political, economic and social inequalities that frequently underlie violence and conflict. Women have been the victims of war; women must now be part of the solutions for peace.  In our work on gender justice, we have been supporting all of those dimensions. For example, in Afghanistan we have supported gender and rights training, the involvement of women in the drafting of laws and their participation in elections. In Rwanda, our support for women leaders has helped to promote their role in Government and today the country has the highest percentage worldwide of women judges and women in Parliament. Our support has also led to the passage of the inheritance bill, which guarantees women and girls the right to inherit property, and will go a long way in helping the agricultural sector. In the Great Lakes region, we assisted the office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General as well as women's organizations in preparing for the Great Lakes Regional Women's Meeting. The calls issued at that Meeting must now be seriously attended to at the meeting of heads of State and Government of the region.  We must never allow the opportunity that post- conflict reconstruction presents for establishing the rule of law to be overlooked. The real cure for violence against women lies in constitutions with strong and clear guarantees of gender equality. It is to be found in legal reforms that ensure equality in marriage and family relations, in the ownership of property and in equal access to secure employment. It depends on women being supported to participate in elections as voters and in ensuring their rightful representation in Government.  With those fundamental building blocks in place, not only will all women be assured of redress for violence, but the prospect of reducing and eventually eliminating gender-based violence finally comes into view. The wholesale damage to lives and communities that is inflicted by the kind of violence that we have seen can never be undone, so our sights must be set not only on redress in the immediate sense, but also on the essential concern of cutting violence off at its roots.  We are at a historical crossroads where the opportunity now exists to make the rule of law and the perspective of women central to peace processes. As noted in the Secretary-General's report, much has been achieved since the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), but much remains to be done. I would like to draw the Council's attention to three areas in particular that were recently highlighted at the Conference on Gender Justice in Post-Conflict Situations.  First, the participation of women and the incorporation of gender dimensions must be increased in all stages of the conceptualization, planning and implementation of United Nations peace operations. Peace operations should have adequate numbers of gender-justice specialist staff in all offices and should seriously draw on the specialized gender expertise available from the United Nations funds and programmes operating on the ground, including UNIFEM. United Nations bodies must also collaborate more closely and more frequently on gender justice objectives with local, professional and academic groups engaged in training women judges and lawyers, and with networks of women and men to help change attitudes and ensure the full participation of women in the post-crisis phase.  Secondly, United Nations peacekeeping personnel have a special obligation not to violate the trust that women and girls place in them. Unfortunately, serious misconduct has been identified. Gender justice must be extended to our international guardians. Means must be developed to ensure the responsibility and accountability of United Nations peacekeeping personnel, who serve as role models to the local communities, for proper behaviour towards women. Comprehensive policies and procedures must be established to prevent and punish trafficking, sexual exploitation and abuse. We have to keep our own house in order if we expect others to do the same.  Thirdly, gender justice must be a priority within the United Nations system, including United Nations peace operations, and institutional arrangements must be strengthened to accelerate progress. We still lack the adequate organizational structures, staffing, resources and coordination needed to achieve gender justice. For post-crisis situations, the United Nations should have a central mechanism to focus on coordinated assistance for gender justice. Together with the United Nations Development Programme and the International Legal Assistance Consortium, UNIFEM. will be following up on some of the recommendations of the Gender Justice Conference, including through the Partners for Gender Justice Initiative. However, further steps will require the involvement of the United Nations system as a whole, as well as Member States, regional organizations and civil society.  Gender justice will not be achieved unless we address the current institutional deficit within the United Nations regarding gender. Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) is a good example of how women have been able to bring issues of protection and their role in peacekeeping to the attention of the Security Council. What is needed now is a serious strategy and comprehensive implementation through a stronger and more coherent gender architecture within the United Nations system and through partnerships with local organizations that address current challenges and promote strategies that have worked.  It has taken more than two decades for women's voices to be seriously heard, a decade to establish the norms and legal frameworks for gender justice needed to eliminate violence against women and to empower women economically and politically. Women from war-torn societies across the world are now waiting for us to fully address the recommendations of resolution 1325 (2000) in ways that can make real differences in their everyday lives. We cannot allow another decade to pass before that happens.  ",
    " There can be no peace without justice. Without the tangible support of justice, women will continue to be victims of violence, for lack of an instrument for world peace and security. Women who survive war have the hard task of surviving in the future that war leaves them. They face humiliation, desolation, despair and the burden of supporting their families in a world that has shown itself to be, at the very least, savage.  We cannot talk of peace and security unless we take concrete action to tackle the terrible injustices people experience in the world of war. Those injustices break the peaceful soul of communities, restrict the participation of women in the socio-economic and political spheres and leave the next generation weak in health, opportunities and hope for equality.  There is international awareness. However, women today still do not have a truly influential role in peace negotiations or in the elaboration of economic policies and programmes. On many occasions, they do not even have an active role in the decisions made in their own families. Change has to begin at home, in the expectations among families and communities of what women can contribute. There has to be a conviction that women must prepare themselves for taking a key and equal role in peace processes. To put it most simply, relations between woman and man must be improved at all levels. It is a question of not allowing justice to be sacrificed to the quest for freedom and peace.  Important strategic plans have been proposed to foster the participation and protection of women in war and peace, but action is largely lacking. There is talk of involving women in peace processes, but even the most basic support has failed to materialize. Without that support, the role of women in the search for peace and security will continue to be limited. Women know the brutality of war over a shared history passed down from one generation to the next. It has been shown that because of their vision and special skills, women bring to the table of peace negotiations a supremely valuable ability and dedication to contribute to world security. Without a fair opportunity for the participation of women, peace will be long in coming.  Women need to be judges, governors, negotiators and business people. They must help to rebuild the world when it has been beaten down by conflict. Women must be present at every stage of decision- making for democracy, peace and justice. Only that way will there be protection from violence and Violence be prevented, in times of peace and in times of war.  The Government of Honduras is committed to supporting all initiatives to strengthen the participation of women. That will undoubtedly have a positive impact on speeding world development.  ",
    " For Bangladesh, the subject of today's deliberations is of topical importance. We therefore thank the United Kingdom presidency for convening this meeting, as we thank others - Under-Secretary-General Guehenno, High Commissioner Arbour and Executive Director Obaid - for their informed presentations.  Appreciation is owed to the Secretary-General for the document at hand (S\/2004\/814). It is true that entire communities suffer the consequences of armed conflict, but the worst sufferers are often women and girls. That information is derived from simple empirical observation.  Bangladesh's cultural matrix provides for high priority with regard to women's issues. That tradition has pervaded most of our contemporary history. It has now found fruition in many innovative ideas that help to empower women. Two examples are microcredit and non-formal education. We have learned that gender mainstreaming helps to marginalize extremist thought and action. It encourages a societal behavioural pattern that is more value-laden than violent. That is perhaps one explanation as to why there have been no incidents connected to international terrorism in Bangladesh.  We have incorporated that value into our foreign policy as a principle. We are always pleased to share our experiences with others. That is why Bangladesh was so closely associated with the development and adoption of the landmark resolution 1325 (2000). It was the Bangladesh presidency that issued a statement on women and peace, for the first time in the Council, on International Women's Day in March 2000. That statement contained a simple thesis. It was that women's participation is an ingredient essential for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security.  We believe that resolution 1325 (2000) is a vital resolution that has set critical norms. We see that as a landmark event. It is heartening that the resolution provides for the integration of gender perspectives into United Nations programmes related to peace.  Acting in partnership with the United Kingdom delegation, Bangladesh sponsored a resolution in the Commission on the Status of Women on mainstreaming a gender perspective into all policies and programmes of the United Nations system. While it is true that Bangladesh and the United Kingdom have many things in common, in terms of development their levels are very different. Yet we collaborated on that issue in order to make the point that gender mainstreaming is a universal value and that it is as much a concern of the developing countries as it is of the developed. Our actions flowed from that belief.  Bangladesh believes that it is, indeed, quite evident in our society that our investment in women has contributed enormously to the creation of standards of pluralism, democracy and human rights. These ideals are essential components of sustainable peace. Our peacekeepers - and we are consistently one of the largest contributors - carry those ideals with them in conflict-ridden places and distant parts. Our main reward lies in the universal appreciation of this global service.  Significant developments have been achieved at the United Nations with regard to the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). Much remains to be done, however. We need to develop guidelines to ensure that all peace-related activities include and support the rule of law and promote gender equality, thus protecting women's human rights.  Systematic use of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in post-conflict countries as a guiding framework would be desirable. The promotion and protection of the human rights of women and of girls in armed conflict throughout the world is a pressing challenge. Their situation - particularly that of those under foreign occupation, such as in the occupied Palestinian territories and the Syrian Golan - remains a matter of grave concern for us.  There is need for a sustained commitment at all times to gender justice and women's empowerment. There must be zero tolerance for crimes against women and girls in conflict situations. Impunity must be ended and the perpetrators of crimes brought to justice.  We must uphold the promises we made in resolution 1325 (2000). Consistent and concerted action, buttressed by genuine political will, is required if we are to realize the goals that have been set. Our aims can thus be achieved through partnerships across the broadest possible spectrum, including with non- governmental organizations and other civil society actors. Thus we could and should move forward from rhetoric to action and from advocacy to implementation.  The meeting was suspended at 1.35 p.m. ",
    " In view of your appeal with regard to the length of statements, Mr. President, I will limit myself to a few brief comments. Copies of the full text of our statement have been circulated.  Resolution 1325 (2000) is broad in scope, and we think it is valuable to take the time this year to deal with this particular issue in depth: as we have heard from so many speakers today, violence against women in conflict situations is reaching epidemic proportions. We note with particular concern that violence against women and girls continues to be used as a weapon of war.  New Zealand has identified several priorities to address violence against women and girls in armed conflict. With regard to the United Nations system, first, we support those calling for a new system-wide action plan for the coordinated implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). As part of this, we note that the increasing representation of women at all levels of United Nations operations and decision-making must be an important part of United Nations efforts.  Secondly, we continue to urge the Security Council to include a systematic and express focus on the gender dimensions of conflict in every case that comes before it. We note that the idea was floated last year of naming a Security Council member to be responsible for tracking implementation of the resolution, and we hope that that idea will be considered seriously by the Council.  Thirdly, on the specific question of peacekeeping, there is an urgent need to inject a clear gender perspective into all facets of United Nations peacekeeping operations. We note that ensuring that will require adequate resourcing by the Security Council and by us, the Member States. Member States also have a major responsibility to nominate women at all levels of United Nations peacekeeping operations.  With regard to the wider United Nations membership, fourthly, we must ensure that we do not just focus on women as victims but recognize their roles as peacemakers and active participants in resolving conflict and building peace at all levels.  Fifthly, impunity for gender-based violence cannot be accepted, and the international legal framework in place to address gender-based Violence in armed conflict must be respected. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which specifically defines rape and other forms of violence against women as war crimes and crimes against humanity, is important in that regard.  ",
    " We greatly welcome this year's debate marking the fourth anniversary of this important resolution and thank you, Sir, for having taken this important initiative. We particularly welcome the fact that the focus is on gender-based violence and on strategies addressing that problem.  I thank Mr. Guehenno, Mrs. Arbour and Ms. Obaid for their important briefings this morning. My delegation also aligns itself with the statement that will be delivered by the Dutch Ambassador later, on behalf of the presidency of the European Union.  Violence against women is an issue of the highest priority because of its human, political, social and economic dimensions. The phenomenon of gender- based violence can be overcome only by the empowerment of women in all aspects of public and private life.  Unfortunately, the list of countries in conflict having a history of gender-based atrocities is long and includes countries from all continents, including Haiti, Afghanistan, Iraq, Myanmar, the former Yugoslavia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and others. The fact that women account for the vast majority of victims of conflicts and are still significantly underrepresented at all levels of decision-making indicates that we need tools and instruments that promote our common vision as expressed in Security Council resolution 1325 (2000).  The continuing extreme violence against women and girls in the Darfur region is a case in point. In order to improve the situation, as well as the future prospects for women in the Sudan, a gender dimension must be integrated into the peace talks. The ratification by the Sudanese Government of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women - the 25th anniversary of which has just been celebrated - would mark another significant step in the right direction.  I would like to welcome the excellent proposals by the Secretary-General on how to implement resolution 1325 (2000), which aim at addressing the issue of women, peace and security in an active way. While fundamentally agreeing with all of those proposals, I would like to focus on several of their action-oriented aspects.  A gender unit is the main guarantor for the effective integration of a gender perspective in any United Nations mission. The Minister of State of the German Foreign Office referred to this requirement during last October's debate on resolution 1325 (2000), at that time referring to the United Nations mission in Afghanistan. However, a gender unit alone is not sufficient even if it is supplied with adequate resources, which, unfortunately, is quite often still not the case. Given the scope of gender-based discrimination, including violence, we need to ensure that all substantive units of a peacekeeping operation, starting with the United Nations assessment team, include specialists with gender expertise. Therefore, more personnel with gender expertise have to be selected during the recruitment process. That also requires that the United Nations continue to train its personnel, including at the level of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, and that Member States invest more in gender training of potential peacekeeping staff. The German Government has made the latter a political priority in its endeavours. We strongly believe in the need for accountability for wartime violence against women, and in the necessity to end impunity. Time-bound goals concerning the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) will be very helpful in that regard.  The International Criminal Court (ICC) certainly has a key role to play with regard to the investigation and prosecution of gender-based crimes. However, its efforts must be supplemented by national legal mechanisms. I also would like to mention the very recent initiative for a conference on gender justice organized by the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and others. Let me express the hope that there will be a concrete follow-up on the key issue of genderjustice.  We are now beginning to understand that disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programmes, which have long been neglected, must also be targeted to include women and girls, since in Africa, for instance, one-third of the combatants, including their so-called supporters, are female. As far as reintegration is concerned, we have to respect that female ex-combatants might well not wish to be reintegrated into structures in which their rights, including economic rights, are not guaranteed.  Let me re-emphasize that Germany, a friend of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), is deeply committed to the vision set forth in that landmark resolution and has undertaken various efforts to realize that vision. Germany is one of the few countries to have provided a detailed report on its national initiatives concerning the implementation of that resolution. We stress the need to include women at all levels of peace negotiations and conflict resolution. The promotion of the full participation of women in post-conflict and reconstruction processes is a political priority.  Having said that, I wish to stress the fact that more can be done by Member States in supporting the United Nations system-wide implementation of the resolution, in all its aspects. From our point of view, the Working Group on Peacekeeping Operations, uniting member States and non-member States of the Security Council, should integrate a gender perspective into its work, as a matter of priority.  Finally, I wish to emphasize the very important contribution of civil society and, in particular, of the non-governmental organizations, which were rightly given an opportunity to meet with the members of the Security Council in an Arrias-style meeting last week.  We welcome initiatives, such as those by Canada, Chile, the United Kingdom and the NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security, to organize round tables with representatives from all Security Council member States, where strategies on the full implementation of the resolution are discussed in a remarkably open and constructive atmosphere.  ",
    " Mr. President, I wish to thank you for having convened this meeting. I wish also to thank Under-Secretary-General Guehenno, High Commissioner Louise Arbour and Executive Director Thoraya Obaid for their presentations. I should like to say to Ms. Arbour that Australia is delighted to have her here in New York, and delighted with her appointment. It is wonderful to have a strong and able High Commissioner in place.  We are proud to reaffirm our commitment to resolution 1325 (2000), which remains a landmark document both for the Council in its recognition of the true dimensions of peace-building and for its international recognition of the particular burden women and girls bear as a result of conflict.  In Australia, community organizations have held public seminars to make the provisions of resolution 1325 (2000) widely known. The Women's International League for Peace and Freedom has been given Government funding for a web site which provides comprehensive information on resolution 1325 (2000). Through our aid programme, we have provided training on the resolution to the Australian Defence Force and to military personnel from the Asia-Pacific region.  Australia has prepared an issues paper that outlines the latest research and best practice on women's roles in peacekeeping in Asia and the Pacific. From our research, we are developing practical aid policy guidelines which will encourage the role of women in peace-building projects.  In recognition of the responsibilities which individual States have, we are incorporating the concepts of resolution 1325 (2000) into our development cooperation programmes. In the Philippines, we are funding the implementation of a national survey on the participation of women in peace, governance and development. That survey will be a milestone in highlighting the concerns of women in the areas of peace, governance and development. We are also funding a conference bringing together women from Mindanao, Cambodia, Timor-Leste, Afghanistan and Solomon Islands to develop awareness of the role of women in post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction.  The international community more generally has made some progress, too, in pursuit of the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, for example, is the first treaty to recognize certain acts of sexual and gender violence as among the most serious crimes under international law.  So, many positive steps have been taken nationally and internationally to implement the provisions of resolution 1325 (2000), but, as we have said at previous meetings, much more needs to be done. We must make sure that women participate effectively at all levels of peace operations and processes. Equally important, we must ensure that men receive training in understanding women's rights and the role of women in peace-building.  It is crucial that we consider gender dimensions of conflict as being integral to the achievement of sustainable and lasting peace. Only then will we achieve a balanced perspective and arrive at balanced solutions. Resolution 1325 (2000) provides the guidance to do this.  We must ensure that the basic principles of conflict prevention, the participation of women in peace and security and the specific protection needs of women are incorporated into the work of the Council, other agencies of the United Nations, the international community more generally and individual Member States. Australia is committed to playing its part in this respect.  ",
    " It is my pleasure to address you today on behalf of the Arab Group and to express the Group's appreciation for the comprehensive report of the Secretary-General on the fifth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security.  I thank those who preceded me for reflecting on the United Nations system-wide efforts to strengthen commitment, accountability and transparency and to evaluate, monitor and report the progress realized.  The Arab countries work in close cooperation with the United Nations system to strengthen the means of protecting women during times of conflict, and to consolidate the role of women and their participation in post-conflict stages. That is in concert with our belief in the major role that women play, especially under the exceptional circumstances represented by foreign occupation with the ensuing deterioration of the humanitarian and economic situation and negative effects on economic and social development.  However, an evaluation of the international situation, five years after resolution 1325 (2000) shows that we have not realized many of the objectives we had hoped for. Palestinian women are still suffering under the pressures of occupation, aggravated by the construction of settlements and the separation wall. They are subjected to the worst and harshest treatment at crossings and checkpoints. As a result of the deaths of many of the husbands and sons of Palestinian women, they have assumed more demanding family obligations beyond their capacity.  Consequently, the Arab Group calls upon the Security Council to take into consideration the situation of Palestinian women under foreign occupation, in addition to that of Syrian and Lebanese women in other occupied Arab territories. The Council must work towards the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Arab territories occupied since 1967, within the context of a comprehensive and just peace agreement, based on the implementation of United Nations resolutions, international legitimacy and the principle of land for peace.  It is difficult to speak of women without referring to a number of the initiatives taken by the Arab countries to enhance the status of women, not only in times of conflict but also in peacebuilding. The first is the establishment of the Arab Women's Organization, which has become an effective Arab institution to safeguard and defend the rights of Arab women, leading towards the realization of the objectives of broader freedom and participation and overall advancement. The organization also seeks coordination and cooperation among Arab countries in enhancing the position of Arab women, as they are the cornerstone for the solidarity of Arab societies. The organization seeks to coordinate the Arab positions in international forums that deal with women's issues, regionally and internationally.  The second initiative is the first international movement for women, security and peace, which began in Egypt at a conference hosted in 2002 at Sharm el- Sheikh, a conference attended by governmental and non-governmental representatives and regional and international organizations and civil society and the United Nations. The movement was registered as a non-profit organization in Geneva in 2003 and has acquired legitimacy as the first international movement that seeks to coordinate responses to calls for putting an end to violence against women in times of conflict and other times, and to enhance the role of women in peacemaking.  In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that we should make the best possible use of all the main organs of the United Nations, each with its original mandate, and without prejudice to the role of the General Assembly regarding humanitarian, economic, social and human rights conditions, including issues relating to women. The Arab Group would like to state that international humanitarian activities should be carried out in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and international humanitarian law, especially with regard to the agreements relative to women - notably the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, and its two additional protocols, and the provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the Beijing Conference and its Plan of Action and the twenty-third special session of the United Nations General Assembly, entitled \"Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century\".  ",
    " We are honoured to participate in today's open debate, especially given that this is the fifth anniversary of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security. My delegation associates itself with the statement made on behalf of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) by the delegation of Namibia as well as with the statement made by the delegation of Canada on behalf of the Human Security Network.  As we commemorate the fifth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), we are realizing now more than ever the important role of women in efforts to achieve peace and security. Time and again, women have played a constructive and essential part in peace processes. They are gradually finding a place at the negotiating table, in the implementation of peace agreements, and in post- conflict rehabilitation, reconstruction and disarmament. It is high time for them to be included in those processes in a more formalized way, at all levels and at all stages.  The continued under-representation of women in formal peace processes and other persistent obstacles and challenges resulting from situations such as gender-based violence, poverty, lack of rule of law and various forms of discrimination prevent women's full and effective participation in conflict resolution. Conflict destroys infrastructure and disrupts essential services, which has a negative impact on the livelihoods of women. We believe, therefore, that more must be done to achieve greater participation and effective contributions by women in developing and implementing post-conflict strategies and programmes. In addition to resolution 1325 (2000), we already have other instruments at the regional and global levels which recognize and seek to enhance the role of women in peace processes. We should use these instruments, and we believe that, with sufficient political will, we can meet the demand for greater inclusion of women in peace negotiations.  Resolution 1325 (2000) calls for the full inclusion of women in international peace and security processes and for action in four critical areas. We note that progress has been made in a number of those areas. However, it is clear that there is still room for improvement, especially with regard to the mainstreaming of gender consciousness in United Nations reporting and implementation systems.  These goals, as set out in resolution 1325 (2000), can become a reality only if there are improvements in terms of information, coordination and cooperation, as well as strengthened commitment and accountability at all levels of the United Nations system. Enhanced cooperation with regional organizations and Member States, as well as civil society and women's national machineries, is also essential, we believe, to its successful implementation.  My delegation therefore notes with appreciation the United Nations system-wide action plan for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), as contained in the report of the Secretary- General. This working document identifies numerous actions that different role-players within the United Nations system can take to further its implementation and which can be used to monitor progress. We encourage immediate implementation of the Secretary- General's proposals so as to put this action plan into practice. Member States can also enhance the United Nations system-wide action plan by continuing to implement resolution 1325 (2000), including through the development of national action plans or other national-level strategies.  The decision by the 2005 world summit to establish the Peacebuilding Commission is, in our view, an important milestone and makes a further contribution to the full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). It opens the door for women with a view to ensuring integration of the gender perspective in all phases of peacebuilding. Our own experience in South Africa has taught us that, given a chance, women can bring an important and much needed perspective to peace processes. Women are no longer simply the victims of wars and conflicts; they are increasingly an important part of the solution. We would urge the Peacebuilding Commission, once established, to pay particular attention to the knowledge and understanding women can bring to peace-building processes.  It is disheartening that sexual and gender-based violence, including trafficking in persons, continue to be used as weapons of war in conflicts. In some parts of the world, gender-based violence has reached near- epidemic proportions. Every effort must be made to halt this odious practice and to bring the perpetrators to justice.  My delegation also wishes to reiterate its condemnation, in the strongest terms, of all acts of sexual misconduct by all categories of personnel in United Nations peacekeeping missions. In that regard, South Africa welcomes the comprehensive report on sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations peacekeeping personnel. We express our support for the efforts of the United Nations to fully implement codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures to prevent and respond to sexual exploitation and to enhance monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. We note with appreciation the strategies and actions included in the system-wide action plan aimed at fully implementing those codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures.  In conclusion, as we look back at the five years of the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), we realize that peace starts with women and that for peace to be sustainable, we should ensure that women live more secure and productive lives and are able to fully enjoy their human rights and fundamental freedoms. We should recognize their invaluable role and contribution as mediators, educators, peacemakers, peacebuilders and advocates for peace. In our view peace attained through the participation of all means, not only the silencing of guns after war but a sustainable effort at ensuring lasting peace and prosperity.  My delegation therefore supports the Secretary- General's report before the Security Council as well as all of the initiatives undertaken by the United Nations in implementing resolution 1325 (2000).  ",
    " Allow me, first, to express the satisfaction of my delegation, as a non- member of the Council, at being able to discuss the issue of women and peace and security in an open meeting on the fifth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). We thank you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting. We wish, in particular, to thank the special panellists who spoke to the Council earlier and added valuable points of view to our deliberations.  At the outset, my Government would like to express its gratitude to the Secretary-General for his report on women and peace and security, contained in  document S\/2005\/636.  Resolution 1325 (2000) was a groundbreaking step forward in reaffirming the importance of the equal participation and the direct involvement of women in conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peacebuilding, as many have said before me. By its adoption, it was finally recognized that women have an important role to play in peace processes and in achieving sustainable peace in conflict regions. That landmark resolution is a challenge to us all, for it requires a fundamental change in procedure, delivery, attitudes and habits.  Since the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), considerable attention has been paid to its implementation within the United Nations. That has been appropriate as we focus on ensuring the mainstreaming of a gender perspective throughout the work of the Organization. We believe that in order to reach the Millennium Development Goals, it is important that a gender perspective be integrated into all strategies and programmes.  In that context, Iceland warmly welcomes the United Nations action plan for implementing resolution 1325 (2000) across the United Nations system, which has been presented to the Security Council in the report of the Secretary-General. The system-wide action plan is an important tool for better coordination and for building on the synergies of the United Nations system. With the adoption of the action plan, the United Nations is creating a good precedent which should encourage Member States to mainstream the gender perspective in their own policies. We also hope that the Peacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding Support Office which our leaders decided to establish will demonstrate a strong commitment to the full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  Women in war and women who have survived war must enjoy protection and justice, and women must be full agents in the shaping and rebuilding of their communities in the aftermath of war. Therefore, we must ensure that the provisions of resolution 1325 (2000) are realized and that women can fully and equally participate at all levels of decision-making with regard to conflict prevention and peacebuilding. It is our duty to continue our work towards the full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) at the national, regional and international levels.  The Icelandic authorities have put emphasis on supporting the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). Indeed, an important part of Iceland's development cooperation is directed towards facilitating a smooth transition from conflict situations, with special emphasis on women and their role in peacebuilding. Here, Iceland's support to the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) is especially worth highlighting. Iceland's contribution to UNIFEM. has more than doubled this year. And for the past few years, the Icelandic Crisis Response Unit has seconded a gender expert to UNIFEM. in Kosovo.  Finally, I would like to underline that Iceland strongly condemns the sexual exploitation and sexual abuse committed by United Nations peacekeeping personnel, and we fully support the Secretary-General in his determination to uproot such behaviour. Such abuse undermines our peace efforts and the credibility of the United Nations. Efforts must be redoubled, and preventive education in this field must be a continuous feature of the training of the United Nations peacekeepers.  ",
    " Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security, adopted five years ago, is a landmark achievement. The review of its implementation is of immense importance to the international community because while we deliberate on this important subject, millions of women and children in all parts of the world still remain mired in disease, poverty and the adverse effects of terrorism.  Resolution 1325 (2000) was a result of the increasing realization of the need to address grave and systematic violations of the human rights of women and children in situations of armed conflict, as well as the recognition of the capacity of women and the contribution that they can make in peacebuilding. While the General Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and the Commission on the Status of Women have addressed these issues from time to time, the Security Council - the United Nations apex body mandated to ensure international peace and security - by this resolution provided an impetus to mainstream gender perspective in promoting peace and security.  Today, women and children account for the majority of civilians adversely affected by armed conflict. They are subjected to grave violations of human rights and to violence at the hands of repressive elements. In situations of armed conflict as well as during war-to-peace transitions and peacebuilding phases, women's needs are rarely addressed with the seriousness that they deserve.  In all such situations, it has been observed that women are more vulnerable and invariably suffer most. That is partly a direct result of violence targeted against them. It is often due to an uneven share of responsibility that women have in running the household, caring for children and even earning a living for the family as war widows. In many situations, a level playing field in terms of gender parity still remains beyond the reach of women.  The effect of armed conflict on the girl-child has been a grave concern in Sri Lanka for some time. Recruitment of children, including girls, to the ranks of an armed group in the conflict in Sri Lanka is a continuing worry for our people. The armed group LTTE, in gross violation of its commitments, continues such recruitment. This affects women in general, who are the primary care givers in most families. This situation where children, in particular girls, are being affected by armed conflict cannot and should not be allowed to continue by the civilized world, and the imposition of targeted actions against the perpetrators of such crimes is a paramount necessity.  In our View, for any national or international action plan to be more effective and result-oriented, it should evolve through a process of consultation with civil society and other relevant actors, and it should contain a time-bound set of targets with monitoring and reporting mechanisms. The Government of Sri Lanka supports such processes worldwide and also as part of its national approach to peace and reconciliation.  In this context, we view Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) as a groundbreaking initiative. The resolution sets forth responsibilities that should be borne by the international community and Member States of the United Nations to ensure a gender perspective and security for women in its multidimensional aspects related to peace, security and peacebuilding.  Against this backdrop, it has now become incumbent upon the Security Council to review the progress made in the implementation of its resolution, as well as to consider further practical measures to strengthen the safety net and security for women in situations of armed conflict and to promote their role in peacebuilding. In doing so, it is essential that the Security Council consider the following important measures. First, the Council should establish a focal point to ensure the integration of resolution 1325 (2000) in the Council's work programme, as well as in mandates, processes and mechanisms of all relevant United Nations agencies. Secondly, it should request the Secretary-General to update, monitor and review the United Nations system-wide action plan on an annual basis. Thirdly, it should determine means by which the Council could be systematically informed of the use of gender-biased violence by parties to armed conflict.  It is time that the United Nations redoubled its efforts in taking immediate, coherent and coordinated actions to translate the commitments undertaken in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, as well as in Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). My delegation fully supports all such efforts in the manifestation of Sri Lanka's commitment towards the protection of women and children in armed conflict and, more importantly, to further our belief in the value of the participation of women in peacemaking and peacebuilding processes.  May I conclude by recalling the words of Eleanor Roosevelt:  \"For it is not enough to talk about peace. One must believe in it. And it isn't enough to believe in it. One must work at it.\"  ",
    " I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for having given the Inter-Parliamentary Union the opportunity to address the Security Council on this very important issue.  Before making my statement, I would like to convey to the Council the greetings of Mr. Pier Ferdinando Casini, Speaker of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, who has just been elected President of our organization for a three-year term and who will be coming to New York early next week for the annual parliamentary hearing at the United Nations.  Women and children suffer the most severe consequences of conflicts that they themselves do not instigate. All of us, therefore, have a responsibility to work in support of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). At a recent IPU Assembly, members of parliament reviewed the situation and drew up an impressive list of actions that they can and do promote in parliaments and elsewhere in support of that resolution.  Fittingly, the IPU - as the world organization of parliaments - addresses the issue of women's participation in peace processes from a parliamentary perspective. Parliaments have a fundamental role to play in peace and reconciliation processes and in the implementation of peace agreements. The very existence of a strong and effective parliament is itself an essential component of any solution to conflict and in the building of peace.  Women must be full and equal participants in political processes. This is not only a question of rights - of equality in society - but also an issue of substance. Surveys we have undertaken clearly demonstrate the fact that many women have a keen awareness of social issues that many men lack. They have a better understanding of specific gender issues, particularly violations of the rights of women during conflict, which need to be addressed in peace processes.  Hence, these peace processes can be truly effective and efficient only to the extent that both women and men participate in them. Yet this is certainly not the case today. In parliaments, for example, women make up only, on average, 16 per cent of the membership. It is therefore encouraging that the presence of women members in parliament in many post-conflict countries has shown a tendency to increase markedly after the conflict, invariably resulting in figures for women members of parliament that are well above the world average. The majority of those countries rank among the top 30 in the world.  Rwanda's proportion has climbed from 17 per cent before the conflict to 49 per cent today. It has the highest relative score of any country. Burundi surged from 9 percent to 30 per cent today and went on to elect a woman as Speaker of Parliament. Mozambique more than doubled, from 16 per cent to 35 per cent. Sierra Leone was at 1 per cent before the conflict started; today, 14 per cent of parliamentarians are women.  What sets these countries apart? We believe it is the fact that they have approached the peace process as an opportunity to instigate real change.  Countries like Rwanda and Burundi have given gender equality issues special attention and consideration from the very beginning of the peace process. They have actually written these issues into their constitutions. They have established transitional national assemblies with greater participation by women and have introduced quotas at the institutional level. They have made sure that women receive leadership training to run for election. The results speak volumes as to what countries should do when experiencing similar situations.  The IPU is present in many post-conflict countries. Our efforts include working with women, helping them to develop their leadership skills and facilitating their work, both as candidates and subsequently as members of parliament.  We also seek to ensure that the institution of parliament is able to address gender issues, and we do so by raising awareness of these issues among women and men both.  Ensuring effective oversight is one key function of parliament, and it includes oversight of the security forces. There are many ways in which parliament can and should exercise its oversight function in the field of security, and we are now working with many parliaments to assist them in introducing a gender perspective on security policy.  We are also assisting parliaments in analysing the national budget from a gender perspective. This is particularly valuable when consolidating peace and making sure that the national budget is allocated in a manner that allows for the implementation of peace agreements, including those components that may be of particular importance to women.  The lessons we have learned from our fieldwork, from parliamentary diplomacy and from our political debates is that we must treat these peace processes as a continuum extending far beyond the final conclusion of an agreement.  We must take a long-term approach to ensure that peace is consolidated and not subjected to renewed threats. We must also ensure that gender issues are addressed from the very beginning of the peace process and that women are included among those who negotiate peace agreements. We have seen the value of transitional assemblies as a vehicle for improvement and, of course, an elected parliament is essential. It is important that the gender composition of such assemblies be discussed early on as well.  There is a need to focus on these institutions, to give them the means they require to become effective, to sensitize men to gender issues, and to sustain this effort over a long period of time.  Let me conclude these remarks by reminding members of the Security Council of the declaration that 150 speakers of parliament adopted here at the United Nations last month. In that declaration, they pledge their support to the United Nations and United Nations reform. They called for a strategic partnership between the organization that I represent here today, the IPU, and the United Nations, with more substantive interaction and coordination between the two organizations.  Specifically, they encourage the United Nations to avail itself more frequently of the political and technical expertise that the IPU, together with its member parliaments, can provide, particularly in areas relating to post-conflict institution-building. The creation of a new Peacebuilding Commission at the United Nations offers an important opportunity to do so. We look forward to working closely with the United Nations in turning this vision into reality.  ",
    " Six weeks ago, the world's leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the full and effective implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). The fact that this resolution is one of only two Security Council resolutions that found explicit reference in the summit's outcome document (General Assembly resolution 60\/1) is a clear sign that its adoption five years ago was a landmark decision. The resolution has the potential to profoundly change the way the Organization deals with conflict prevention, conflict resolution and peacebuilding. However, that potential has yet to be fully used.  The fifth anniversary of the resolution's adoption provides a welcome opportunity to assess the impact the resolution has had on the ground and to identify ways and means to accelerate its implementation at the local, national and international levels. We commend the remarkable work undertaken by the 37 United Nations entities that have contributed to the elaboration of the system-wide action plan. That plan provides a wealth of information on activities being carried out for women in conflict and post-conflict situations. It should facilitate the review of the impact of resolution 1325 (2000). In order to make that possible, it will be necessary to provide for interaction and consultations with civil society, in particular women's non- governmental organizations (NGOs).  At the national level, such interaction could form the basis for the establishment of action plans for the implementation of the resolution. That would help to raise awareness of the need to promote the active participation of women in decision-making regarding all aspects of conflict prevention and peacebuilding. Without such active involvement, decision-making will continue to be ineffective. For that reason, we are also of the view that the mandate of the Peacebuilding Commission should include an explicit commitment to partnering with civil society, including women's organizations, through formal mechanisms at Headquarters as well as at the country level. That would go a long way towards ensuring that women's needs, priorities and roles in peace processes are duly taken into account in the work of the Peacebuilding Commission. To that end, 14 women Foreign Ministers, including the Foreign Minister of Liechtenstein, have signed a letter on the issue of the Peacebuilding Commission.  In order for women to be heard and for their concerns to be taken into account, they must be involved in peace negotiations. There is ample evidence that women are very active in informal peace processes. However, that is not the case in formal processes. All too often that is due to the fact that women are hardly represented in the official groups that are common players in conflicts and their settlement, such as Governments, political parties, armed groups and militias. In addition, a lack of knowledge of the manner in which formal processes are conducted or of international legal and other standards is often presented as an excuse for not including women in such formal processes.  Strengthening women's capacity as peacemakers must be pursued in parallel with increasing women's participation. At the same time, women need to be encouraged and empowered to hold decision-making positions. Creating awareness of peace negotiations as a tool for achieving gender equality is essential.  Against that background, we have constantly advocated the appointment of women as special representatives and envoys of the Secretary-General. Such appointments could play a major catalytic role in more strongly involving women in peace processes, especially when they reach more formal stages. They would also strengthen the awareness of the need to mainstream gender issues not only into peace processes but also into other political processes. We are of the view that the number and consistency of such appointments should become an essential element for the review of the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and part of an overall assessment with regard to the nomination of women at the higher levels of peacemaking, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. At the same time, we are aware of the need to provide the Secretary-General with names of well-qualified potential candidates for such posts. We therefore invite all interested States and NGOs to join forces in gathering the necessary information to make the appointment of women to such posts not only a priority but a reality.  ",
    " Let me begin by thanking the delegation of Romania for having convened this meeting, once again focusing the attention of the Security Council on the indispensable role of women in all efforts to build and maintain peace and security.  I would like to associate my delegation with the statement to be delivered later by the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom on behalf of the European Union.  Armed conflict affects women and men in different ways. The scale and the character of the violence committed against women and girls in conflict situations is shocking. It is unacceptable and utterly deplorable when rape, sexual abuse and HIV\/AIDS are used deliberately as weapons of war.  But women are not only victims. The resources women possess are striking. In many cases women are the sole providers and protectors of their families - often under extremely difficult circumstances - in the local community, in refugee camps or as internally displaced persons. Their engagement must be at the core of any peacebuilding initiatives and reconstruction efforts.  Experience shows that the involvement of women in conflict resolution and peace negotiations speeds up the peace process and contributes to sustainable solutions. It is important, however, to underline that the  early involvement of women in the peace process can create a platform for women's further engagement in the reconstruction and development of their countries.  Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) is unique. It focuses on the need to protect the rights of women. It also underlines the need to use the resources possessed by women before, during and after a conflict. Resolution 1325 (2000) has great potential because it is comprehensive. The challenge is to transform words into action. Unfortunately, the challenge is as great today as it was five years ago.  Coordination between the various actors involved and their civilian and military instruments and capabilities must be improved. That applies to the United Nations, to the multilateral and regional organizations and to Member States, as well as to non- governmental organizations. Denmark is convinced that the Peacebuilding Commission can play a key role in achieving that. It goes without saying that the provisions of resolution 1325 (2000) will be important guiding principles for the work of the Peacebuilding Commission.  As Member States, we also have an obligation to implement the resolution in the best and most effective way. In June, the Danish Government launched a national action plan for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). Denmark is firmly committed to implementing all elements of resolution 1325 (2000). The action plan is the result of the fruitful cooperation between Denmark's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its Ministry of Defence. It outlines a series of political and operational actions engaging foreign, defence and development cooperation policies, each of which is of equal importance for the full implementation of the recommendations set out in resolution 1325 (2000).  We warmly welcome the system-wide action plan for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) presented here today. The action plan responds to the need for more systematic implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) in all United Nations activities related to conflict and for greater coordination throughout the United Nations system.  The Secretary-General's report points out the need for the formulation of strategies, actions, programmes and enhanced inter-agency cooperation. Denmark is especially happy to see that strengthened commitment and accountability at the highest level in the United Nations is one of the objectives. It is of crucial importance that the United Nations - now and in the future - demonstrates full commitment to the action plan at all levels.  The report contains 12 areas of action, including the full range of activities before, during and after conflict. The issue of responding to sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations staff, related personnel and mission partners is one of the key areas of action. Sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeeping forces and other United Nations staff must be stopped. We - the United Nations and Member States - need to demonstrate firm action and prosecute the perpetrators, who are violating not only our trust, but the trust of those they were send to help and protect. The policy of zero tolerance has to be implemented.  When resolution 1325 (2000) was adopted it was a major accomplishment. However, the resolution will truly benefit women living in conflict only when the recommendations have had an impact on all areas of intervention and cooperation. As is always the case at the United Nations, the real challenge is to move from good intentions and strong words on paper to concrete results on the ground. That is always difficult, but it is never impossible.  Denmark believes that national action plans are the first step on the way. We urge other Member States to systematize their efforts and develop national action plans to ensure the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). The members of the Security Council could lead the process and set an example.  Only by taking action can we make a difference for the millions of women in conflict situations. Let us take the responsibility upon ourselves to make the resolution on women, peace and security a reality.  ",
    " In the five years since the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), we have managed to accomplish a great deal. We note with satisfaction that the range of issues under discussion today are being given greater attention not only in the Security Council, but also within the framework of the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and its functional commissions, particularly the Commission on the Status of Women. The process of gender mainstreaming is being pursued in all aspects of United Nations activities. Useful recommendations in this area were made by the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change (A\/59\/565)and in the report of the Secretary-General entitled \"In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all\" (A\/59\/2005).  Nevertheless, there is still much to be done. A particularly difficult situation continues to prevail on the African continent, where the status of women has become dramatic in some cases. That shows that we need to make even greater efforts to achieve the full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), We have scarcely exhausted the resolution's potential as an important guide in defining the roles of women in conflict prevention and settlement and in post-conflict reconstruction. That is made particularly clear by States' commitment to the full and effective implementation of the resolution, as reaffirmed in the outcome document (resolution 60\/1) of the 2005 summit.  In a so-called era of fulfilling commitments, we need to make practical use of the resolution's provisions by establishing equal opportunity for active participation by women in all efforts to maintain and promote peace and security and by enhancing women's role in decision-making. We believe that, in the near future, gender perspectives must be given their appropriate place in the activities of the Peacebuilding Commission, whose mandate should be elaborated with a view to the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). On the whole, the centre of activities in this area should be shifted from the Security Council to specific everyday situations in international life. Of course, reliable results will be achieved only in the context of naturally developing processes.  A good basis for mobilizing the efforts of United Nations agencies is being established through the system-wide action plan for the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), set out in the report of the Secretary-General (S\/2005\/636). We welcome the plan's detailed identification of concrete activities that will enable us to focus the Organization's activities on implementing a system-wide strategy for dealing with problems in the area of women and peace and security.  We note the opportunities that the plan provides for strengthening inter-agency coordination and structural accountability. In that connection, it is important that gender mainstreaming in the field not be merely a declared intention, but rather that it produce concrete results that protect and enhance the situation of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict situations. We also welcome the intention of the Secretary-General, as reflected in his report on the implementation of the summit outcome, to ensure policies of zero tolerance with regard to sexual exploitation by United Nations personnel.  Bearing in mind that women are able to play and are already playing a greater role in all aspects of conflict prevention and settlement, we support the elaboration of a strategy to ensure full participation by women in peace negotiations and in elections. In the context of post-conflict reconstruction, we must make greater use of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women as an essential document.  Moreover, we should devote greater attention to gender mainstreaming in the work of United Nations programmes and funds aimed at overcoming poverty in post-conflict situations. We are thinking in particular of strategies for enhancing women's participation in decision-making on social and economic issues and in the establishment of national frameworks for achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  In conclusion, I should like to reaffirm our conviction that the issue of women's participation in peace processes will receive comprehensive and priority consideration in the bodies of the United Nations system.  ",
    " It is a privilege to address the Council at this open debate and to introduce the report of the Secretary-General on women, peace and security (S\/2006\/770). Let me begin by expressing gratitude to you, Mr. President, for convening this crucially important meeting on the roles of women in the consolidation of peace. I am also deeply heartened by the Council's continued commitment to the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  The Council has before it the report of the Secretary-General on women, peace and security, prepared in response to the request of the Council contained in its presidential statement S\/PRST\/2005\/52. The report contains a comprehensive and candid assessment of the first eight months of carrying out the System-wide Action Plan for the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), in support of activities and commitments by Governments and civil society. The assessment identifies progress and challenges in the implementation of the Plan and offers measures to redress the shortcomings. The Plan has proved to be a useful tool for strengthened inter-agency coordination.  The consolidation of peace is an opportunity to redress grievances and problems that led to conflict in the first place. It holds the promise of establishing equality in a democratic environment and reforming institutions in ways that enable women to take full advantage of opportunities presented through the restoration of peace. Yet, the past year has demonstrated that our collective efforts to ensure equal participation by women in the consolidation of peace have thus far generally fallen short of what is required. From the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the Sudan, and from Somalia to Timor Leste, women continue to be exposed to violence or to be targeted by parties to a conflict, as well as to be marginalized in formal processes, in particular as regards issues of war and peace.  It is axiomatic that States, in particular those emerging from conflict situations, and their Governments have a vested interest in maintaining peace and security, and hence in bringing about the 06-58727  political reorganization of society and establishing credible institutions that can result in human security for all, in particular for women and girls. However, it is no secret that, even with political will at the top and pressure from women's groups below, many Governments are generally hesitant to challenge pre- conflict societal values and norms that are often deeply patriarchal and wedded to customary practices. To overcome that challenge, the following four conditions should be met.  First, the international community should summon all possible political will in order to meet its commitments to women in the realm of peace and security. Secondly, at the national level, Governments should establish clear accountability systems for the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). Thirdly, the Security Council should provide more effective leadership to monitor progress in the implementation in the field and should encourage States to do more. And finally, States and United Nations entities should allocate sufficient resources and capacities for the national implementation of the resolution.  A frank and constructive discussion on how to meet those and other challenges related to national implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) was held on 23 October. It underlined the critical importance of national implementation as the key to achieving sustainable peace and the equal participation of women in peace processes. Within that framework, the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women last month released \"Securing equality, engendering peace: a guide to policy and planning on women, peace and security\".  The full and effective implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) will require all the will and creativity the international community can muster. We can succeed in achieving sustainable peace if we - Member States, United Nations entities and civil society - put our minds to it and use the tools, resources and knowledge at our disposal to fully empower women. For its part, the United Nations will remain a strong partner for Member States and civil society. I look forward to working with everyone in that quest.  ",
    " Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to address publicly the problem of sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping and the progress achieved to date to tackle it.  As I begin, I must say a few words of admiration for the efforts of His Royal Highness Prince Zeid Ra'ad Zeid Al-Hussein, the Secretary-General's Adviser on Sexual Exploitation and Abuse by United Nations Peacekeeping Personnel. He has given us unflinching diplomatic and practical support on this issue. His involvement has been invaluable, and we are grateful for it. I also must highlight the exceptional leadership Assistant Secretary-General Jane Holl Lute has demonstrated this past year in galvanizing the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and the United Nations system as a whole to deal with this problem more seriously than we ever have in the past.  Most of all, I express deep appreciation for the amount of time, energy and political attention that Member States have invested recently in seeking solutions to the problem. The troop-contributing countries especially deserve praise for engaging with the Secretariat and the membership at large on issues of extreme sensitivity and of great importance to their national honour. I stress the word \"honour\", because it has been earned at the cost of the lives of some of their finest uniformed personnel.  Security Council members know well that just some weeks ago three Jordanian soldiers died fighting gang members while helping to strengthen a central checkpoint on Haiti's most dangerous road. Not long before that a Canadian Royal Mounted Police officer was killed in an ambush while patrolling in Port-au- Prince. In the jungles of the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, eight Guatemalan special forces soldiers lost their lives in a firefight with a hateful militia group. A year ago this week nine of their 06-25109 comrades from Bangladesh also fell in the line of duty in clashes with armed thugs.  Unfortunately, they are not alone. This is a dangerous business, claiming and threatening the lives of men and women from Peru to Pakistan, Ireland to India, Bolivia to Brazil. But despite the risks, day in and day out, United Nations personnel - civilians, military and police alike - from 120 countries get on with doing their jobs in tough conditions and at great personal sacrifice.  We dishonour those brave men and women when we fail to prevent or punish those from within their ranks who victimize the very people peacekeepers are meant to protect and serve. I am not so sure that this was fully understood a few years ago as clearly as it is today. Two years ago, prior to the revelation that a shockingly large number of United Nations peacekeepers had committed sexual exploitation and abuse in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, neither we in DPKO nor Member States openly discussed or fully appreciated the magnitude of the problem of sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping.  Today, not only is the severity of the problem openly recognized, but the General Assembly has adopted a comprehensive strategy to tackle it, building on the collective efforts of Prince Zeid, DPKO and the United Nations system at large. This strategy focuses on prevention and enforcement, and it will - upon approval by the General Assembly of a policy on victim assistance - incorporate remediation as well.  We have already made concrete and meaningful progress to implement that strategy. Before discussing this, though, I want to be clear up front that we still have a considerable way to go. It must be said that not all troop contingents or staff on the ground fully support - even after all the negative publicity and attention - aspects of the zero-tolerance policy, particularly as it pertains to prostitution. We will need to work together to address that point. We also need to strengthen markedly the capacity of peacekeeping operations and of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) to investigate violations while respecting due process. Once we have overcome those hurdles, we expect to narrow significantly the continuing gap between zero tolerance and full compliance. Until then, as we even more aggressively seek out non-compliance, measured against a higher 06-25109 standard than ever before, the progress being made will not seem obvious, nor will it be enough.  Let me now refer to the progress that we have achieved. We are making headway in laying the foundations for the prevention of the problem in the longer term. Two years ago, we did not even have a uniform standard governing what is, and what is not, considered to be sexual exploitation and abuse. One can hardly prevent the problem if one cannot define it clearly and consistently. Today, we can. Thanks to the efforts of the General Assembly last year, all United Nations civilian staff members, military personnel, contingents, United Nations volunteers and contractors are bound by the same very strict standards outlined in the Secretary-General's prohibitions on sexual exploitation and abuse.  In the past, we did not do enough to promulgate, publicize and train personnel on whatever standards were on the books. Today, we most certainly do. Between 79 and 90 per cent of civilian police and military personnel receive mandatory training on sexual exploitation and abuse. Our aim is 100 per cent.  We have also developed tools to reinforce that training and its underlying message of the duty of care that every peacekeeper has to the people whom they are meant to help. DPKO has worked with an outside professional company to produce a film on the code of conduct for peacekeepers. It has been widely distributed in the field and translated into a dozen languages. I am pleased to report that it has been well received.  We have developed and are making use of other innovative tools and training materials to educate and inform personnel. They include an online e-learning standards of conduct module, pocket cards, mission- readiness booklets distributed to staff prior to deployment, security briefings and posters and brochures on sexual exploitation and abuse and human trafficking - prepared, I might add, in six languages - as well as other public information tools.  Our personnel are not the only people whom we are targeting with this material. We are sharing it with host populations as well. They have a right to know the standards we expect of our people. They are also often in a better position to know when our personnel are violating those high standards. We are now actively encouraging and making it easier for the local 3 population to bring breaches of conduct to our attention.  But prevention cannot be achieved through training, information and public outreach alone. Welfare is another important part of the equation, as armed forces throughout the world know all too well. This is especially true when uniformed personnel, as well as civilians, are deployed in quasi war-zones in the remotest parts of the world. Missions are now addressing that issue as a high priority. Most are now creating constructive recreational outlets, and several have even established, from existing resources, multipurpose sporting, socializing and dining facilities. Those are the types of initiatives included in our welfare strategy and standard operating procedures on welfare promulgated and sent to all heads of mission last month. In our discussions in the General Assembly, we will encourage troop-contributing countries to make use, in the mission area, of the welfare stipend paid by the Organization for every military peacekeeper. It is important that the issue of welfare and recreation be a priority, with a view to keeping soldiers busy when they are not on duty.  With regard to enforcement, we have also made some progress. During 2005, investigations have been completed into allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse involving 296 peacekeeping personnel, the breakdown by category being 84 civilians, 21 police and 191 military. So far, 17 civilians, 16 police and 137 military personnel have been dismissed or repatriated. Those numbers include six commanders. For the past year, we had been making managers and commanders aware that they will be held accountable for those under their chain of command, and we mean it. We are in the process of making this accountability part of their performance evaluation. We have also sought and received the cooperation of two Member States in repatriating entire units for misconduct, in part related to sexual exploitation and abuse and in part related to other misconduct.  One of the major reasons why we have made significant headway in the areas of enforcement and prevention is that Member States have recently given us the means to ensure that professional experts are dedicated to the task full time. As recommended by the Zeid report and endorsed by the General Assembly, we have designed, recruited for and staffed a multi- disciplinary conduct and discipline team at DPKO Headquarters, in addition to eight conduct and discipline teams established in peacekeeping operations in Burundi, Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Liberia, Sierra Leone, the Sudan and Timor-Leste.  The conduct and discipline teams develop policy, provide oversight of disciplinary issues and ensure the coherent application of United Nations standards of conduct. In missions, the teams provide policy advice to heads of mission on discipline, receive allegations from complainants, collaborate with the Integrated Mission Training Centres and help the mission leadership maintain a watchful eye on all issues related to conduct and discipline. The field has largely welcomed that important tool in the arsenal to combat sexual exploitation and abuse as well as other forms of indiscipline.  In addition, the conduct and discipline teams are crucial in bringing the outreach to the host populations, to which I referred earlier. They have been active in making communities aware of the various methods - by telephone, e-mail or in person - through which complaints can be made in a confidential setting. In the middle of the year, we will formally launch a new comprehensive database to track and monitor all allegations. In the interim, we have implemented a file- sharing mechanism to report and store allegations securely and confidentially. We have developed a public information strategy and implementing procedure to guide missions in responding actively and transparently to local media and host populations on sexual exploitation and abuse issues.  The DPKO conduct and discipline teams rely heavily on an ever-growing collaboration in this area with OIOS - the investigating authority for sexual exploitation and abuse offences. OIOS is an essential partner and a central element of our comprehensive strategy with regard to those important issues, which is why DPKO requested OIOS to undertake a global audit on discipline, among many numerous other audits, to help us identify and fix the most difficult problems in the field. We need its help and expertise; we cannot possibly be aware of all potential wrongdoing occurring across the globe, in 18 missions, comprising over 85,000 people drawn from over 100 countries.  The specialized capacity of the OIOS helps ensure thoroughness in the handling and investigation of complaints, and it has established an investigative presence in six missions. But its hand must be strengthened; currently, OIOS does not have all the resources to do the job that it is being asked to do.  Investigations in the field pose certain problems. While troop-contributing countries have been requested to coordinate with OIOS in a manner that satisfies the requirements of their national jurisdictions, not all Member States are comfortable with the investigative role given to OIOS by the General Assembly, and have reserved their rights with respect to their uniformed personnel on the ground. We must sort through that issue to ensure rapid, reliable means of determining the facts, preserving the rights of the victims and the accused and discharging justice fairly.  Those measures are what we have put in place together with our partners in the United Nations system, and we continue to develop those and other initiatives the areas of prevention and enforcement.  Under the heading of what might be termed remediation, we have made progress with our United Nations partners in developing a policy regarding support to victims. A United Nations-wide task force, led by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and DPKO, has overseen the preparation of that policy, on which there have been broad consultations over the past year, including several meetings with Members States. It is being transmitted to the Secretary-General this week for final discussions and forwarding to Member States, as requested in the Summit Outcome document.  The measures I have described are the beginning of a programme of systemic and sustained change. We have made significant progress. However, there is a great deal yet to be done and for that, as we will make clear in our discussions in the General Assembly, we need greater support from Member States.  We will urge Member States to adopt a revised memorandum of understanding to incorporate the standards of conduct contained in the Secretary- General's prohibitions. We will urge Member States to firmly endorse the creation of fully fledged conduct and discipline units at Headquarters and in the field, and to establish such units in missions that are not currently served by them. Those units, as I have explained, are an essential tool for preventing misconduct and monitoring compliance with United Nations standards. 06-25109  We will urge Member States, including all troop- contributing countries, to send an uncompromising message against prostitution in peacekeeping missions. Indeed, today, the single measure that would do the most to reduce the level of allegations and strengthen the policy of zero tolerance against sexual exploitation and abuse is if all troop contingents had an active and effective policy against all prostitution in mission areas.  We will appeal to Member States not to conflate the issues of procurement procedures being stretched by honest peacekeepers trying to get a job done with financial fraud and with sexual exploitation and abuse. It is one thing for auditors - and I happen to be an auditor by training - to disagree about whether financial loss to the Organization has occurred because a field manager chose to use mission aircraft to fly rations to troops when fuel supplies in a country were unexpectedly cut off and left a contractor unable to deliver them; it is another matter altogether when procurement officials deliberately defraud the Organization. But let me stress that, regardless of any divergence of views on methodology and accounting for loss, DPKO takes all OIOS findings and recommendations very seriously and is addressing the weaknesses identified in peacekeeping procurement in the same comprehensive, professional and sustained manner with which we have addressed the sexual exploitation and abuse issue over the past 18 months.  On that point, the Assistant Secretary-General for Mission Support, the Chef de Cabinet, the Head of OIOS, the Under-Secretary-General for Management and I are all fully on board with the Secretary- General's position that we need to be proactive and aggressive in detecting and dealing swiftly with this critical issue. If allegations are proven following due process, dishonest people should be fired and face justice. That is as important here as it is in the case of sex crimes, which constitute a different and most egregious category of offence and demand the highest degree of vigilance.  And finally, we will be seeking formal support from Member States on a longer-term reform agenda for peacekeeping in general, as outlined in the Secretary-General's report now before the General Assembly's Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations. The implementation of those reforms should also help to address some underlying structural 5 weaknesses that give rise to the acts of misconduct we have been discussing over the past few days.  In conclusion, I want to say that we have tens of thousands of extremely competent, honest and courageous personnel in the field. Those are the nationals - uniformed and civilian personnel alike - of Member States. We cannot allow acts of serious misconduct by some to betray their good work and tarnish the reputation of United Nations peacekeeping. It is an indispensable instrument, it is effective, and it is helping maintain peace for tens of millions of people around the world.  ",
    " I would like to fully align myself with the statements made by the representative of Finland on behalf of the European Union and the representative of Slovenia on behalf of the Human Security Network.  Like others, I also would like to extend my thanks to you, Sir, for marking the sixth anniversary of the adoption by the Council of resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security by holding an open debate on the role of women in the consolidation of peace. This subject deserves our full attention and, even more important, concrete action.  If we are really serious about promoting peace and security, we cannot afford to miss a single opportunity to promote women's rights and increase women's participation in peace processes, and it is crucially important at this point in time that women's rights organizations, such as those whose representatives spoke before me, are speaking out. They are calling on their leaders and on us, the international community, to fully include them in the peace processes.  War and conflict affect women, men, girls and boys in different ways. Shocking reports about the widespread occurrence of gender-based violence are almost daily news. In many resolutions and meetings, we condemn this kind of violence, yet it remains increasingly used as an instrument to terrorize civilian populations.  We must turn the tide and take action now. Gender-based violence is not an inevitable consequence of war and conflict. Resolution 1325 (2000) highlighted the importance of women's protection needs, and several United Nations agencies,  such as the United Nations Development Programme, are active in reforming the security and justice sectors to ensure that those institutions are responsive to those needs. In that regard, I also should mention the adoption of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court as a groundbreaking development in the criminalization of sexual and gender-based violence.  What steps has the Netherlands taken to transform resolution 1325 (2000) into action? First, we have established an inter-ministerial task force on women in situations of conflict and peacekeeping to ensure an integrated approach towards the issue. The Ministries of Social Affairs and Employment, Defence, the Interior and Foreign Affairs have brought relevant actors together and raised awareness in support of the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). As a result, the Ministry of Defence has set up a gender force to ensure that a gender perspective is embedded in the planning and implementation of peace support operations.  In addition, the Netherlands supports both national and international non-governmental organizations and United Nations agencies in advancing the involvement of women in maintaining and promoting sustainable peace. Since 1997, the Government of the Netherlands has, for example, provided support for efforts to ensure the effective involvement of Sudanese women in the peace processes in the Sudan.  As a follow up to resolution 1325 (2000), the Netherlands, together with other partners, has provided the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) with funds for gender expertise to integrate a gender perspective into peacekeeping operations. In the course of this year, together with Norway and the United Kingdom, we undertook a joint donor review of DPKO's implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). Our joint findings in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kosovo, Sierra Leone and Liberia were presented to Under-Secretary-General Guehenno this week. They include numerous good practices, as well as lessons learned and remaining gaps and challenges. The overall conclusion was that significant progress towards the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) has been made and that the gender advisers are doing an excellent job. However, commitment and accountability are still limited, especially at the senior and middle-management levels. The Netherlands welcomes the initiative of Under-Secretary-General Guehenno to issue a clear policy directive to his staff in that regard.  Another challenge is coordination between the security, humanitarian and development pillars on the ground, which is often insufficient, sometimes resulting in overlap in work. Moreover, gender is still not always considered to be an integrated and essential cross-cutting issue in peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts. Those gaps need to be addressed by DPKO, which is in the lead; by the Peacebuilding Commission, which will have to play an important role in that respect; by the United Nations country teams on the ground; and by us all in order to guarantee successful implementation. The overall availability of adequate financial and human resources is key to more sustainable progress and success in the future.  In conclusion, I would like to underline the continued crucial role of the Security Council, including the need for it systematically to integrate resolution 1325 (2000) into its work. It starts by including the gender perspective and a specific, explicit reference to resolution 1325 (2000) in all its resolutions that establish or extend mandates for peacekeeping missions and monitoring their implementation in its subsequent work.

    " The Russian Federation attaches great significance to upholding high moral and ethical standards of conduct for all categories of United Nations peacekeeping personnel. This matter deserves ongoing attention by the Organization and its Member States. Today, when peacekeeping activities are increasingly serving as a gauge of the effectiveness of the United Nations in matters of international peace and security, we cannot allow the good reputation of peacekeepers to be sullied by actions of sexual exploitation and abuse. We believe that the United Nations must undertake comprehensive and vigorous actions to combat this scourge.  In that regard, we would like to express our appreciation to the Under-Secretary-General, Mr. Guehenno, and to the Secretariat as a whole for their report today, which, in our view, is indeed of a comprehensive nature.  I should like also to express our appreciation to the Adviser to the Secretary-General, the Permanent Representative of Jordan to the United Nations, Prince Zeid Al-Hussein, for his contribution to the development of a \"zero tolerance\" policy for sexual exploitation and abuse. We also welcome the efforts being undertaken in that regard by the General  Assembly and by its Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, and we are prepared to participate actively in that work. We will be interested to see the results of the work of the legal experts on a seldom-studied question: that of eliminating impunity among the civilian personnel of peacekeeping missions.  In our view, critical tasks in terms of eliminating instances of sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping operations would involve the following steps.  The first step would require a harmonization of the existing rules of conduct for peacekeepers and their articulation in a clear and accessible form, so that they could become an important part of the training of peacekeeping personnel.  Secondly, a system should be established for interaction among the Secretariat, the troop- contributing countries and the host States, within their respective competencies. Success in that regard would lie not in redistributing responsibilities among participants in peacekeeping work, but rather in establishing channels for their interaction.  The third step would involve the establishment of a mechanism that is effective and as transparent as possible to ensure accountability with respect to the investigations conducted and the measures taken. We believe that all of those measures must receive in-depth consideration so as to make them effective in the long term.  The Security Council can also play an important role in combating sexual crimes. The role of this body must be first and foremost to draw up the mandates of peacekeeping missions with great care and to establish a reliable political monitoring mechanism for their implementation. Peacekeeping contingents must receive clear instructions as to what actions they are allowed to take, and their preparation and numbers must be in line with their functions. We, too, believe that there is a need to develop a strategy better to organize leisure and recreational activities for the contingents. Nevertheless, we believe that what is even more important is the rational organization of the on- duty time of the peacekeepers. Here it would be good, perhaps, to remind ourselves of the old saying that exists in the military that a soldier's idle mind is the devil's workshop.  ",
    " I wish to begin by thanking you, Sir, for convening this dialogue and the representatives of the Secretariat for the interesting and inspiring briefings we have heard this morning. They have set the tone for today's discussion.  Since the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), Guatemala has supported Council members' efforts to ensure its ongoing and comprehensive implementation. We have seen the growing interest throughout the world in the situation of women and girl children in armed conflict. We have strenuously condemned the persistence of gender-based violence in conflict situations, as well as sexual exploitation, violence in general and abuse.  We have also stressed the need to put an end to the impunity of the perpetrators so as to bring peace, justice and genuine reconciliation to conflict areas, thereby ensuring that the social fabric of communities does not deteriorate further and in order to construct a lasting and robust peace.  Guatemala suffered more than three decades of armed conflict, and during the negotiations on Guatemala's peace agreements signed in 1996, an entire section specifically referring to the importance of the role of women in maintaining peace, in particular indigenous women, was incorporated. There is also an entire section on the importance of women's participation in strengthening the impact of civil society. In that connection, we share Ms. McAskie's vision of the catalytic role and comparative advantages that the Peacebuilding Commission can have in that respect in situations on the ground.  We also thank the Secretary-General for his report (S\/2006\/770), which discussed frankly and comprehensively the shortcomings in the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), thus making  it possible to adopt the collective measures needed to correct them. At the same time, it pointed out the opportunities that the Action Plan offers for the resolution's implementation and recognized the progress made so far.  We wish to highlight the work accomplished by the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women in implementing resolution 1325 (2000) and the Action Plan. We thank the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women for preparing the guide for national action planning entitled \"Securing Equality, Engendering Peace\", which will undoubtedly assist in national capacity-building with a gender perspective.  We wish to express our gratitude to all of the system's agencies and funds that have worked to ensure women's participation at all stages of peacekeeping and peacebuilding processes - particularly the United Nations Development Fund for Women, which has been promoting the participation of Guatemalan women in electoral processes and in leadership training in communities and local governments since 1997. We also thank the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, which has contributed to the effort to increase women's participation in Guatemalan contingents on United Nations missions.  As we say in my country, there is a wide gap between words and deeds. The objective of gender equality is still far from being attained, despite the fact that it is established in the Charter, reiterated in various instruments of international law and emphasized in resolution 1325 (2000). It is regrettable that, as the report reveals, six years after the adoption of the Security Council resolution and 61 years after the establishment of the United Nations, only 26.07 per cent of the Council's resolutions include language relating to women or gender. That shows us that our level of compliance with the commitments undertaken in the area of women's advancement still falls well below expectations. More support is needed in this area, where it is most lacking.  In Guatemala, we understand very well the importance of women's participation in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration processes in their communities of origin. A gender perspective must be systematically incorporated into all the multifaceted efforts of Member States and of the United Nations and should become a primary component of their policies, programmes and activities. But, above all, it must be a central theme in the maintenance of international peace and security.  Guatemala's army has included women since it resumed its participation in peacekeeping operations. Currently, out of the 85 Guatemalan personnel deployed in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, seven are women. For the first time in our history, a woman lieutenant has been appointed to command an operations unit. There are also seven women among the 114 Guatemalan soldiers deployed in the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  For all those reasons, our delegation agrees with the measures recommended by the Secretary-General in his report, particularly the establishment of an effective accountability, monitoring and reporting system for a new cycle of the Action Plan, which will be renewed in 2007. We hope that it will cover the entire system. We agree that the renewal should be prepared in accordance with the conclusions and measures set out in the report. In particular, we support the Action Plan's renewal to make it a tool for results- based programming, monitoring and reporting.  We also believe that heads of units, special representatives and envoys of the Secretary-General should be held responsible for mainstreaming a gender perspective into policies and programmes. Moreover, we should strengthen capacity for full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), improve coordination of the system, particularly on the ground, and provide incentives for the participation of all interested sectors of civil society.  Not to involve women and girls at all levels of capacity-building in the area of peacebuilding would be to make them the most vulnerable group, shown no mercy by the enemies of peaceful coexistence.  ",
    " I have the honour to take the floor on behalf of the European Union (EU) and the other countries aligning themselves with this statement. In trying to help the Council make the best use of its time, I should like to draw attention to my delegation's written statement, copies of which are being distributed; I shall limit myself to a number of salient points.  It is deeply regrettable that the United Nations has had to confront instances of sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeeping personnel. It is tragic that the shameful misconduct of a few should detract from the  vital contribution to peace and security made by the women and men serving in United Nations peacekeeping operations. The credibility of the United Nations and the viability of United Nations peacekeeping operations is undermined by such appalling behaviour. It is imperative that this scourge be stamped out.  The European Union has supported from the beginning the strong stance taken by the Secretary- General on this issue, including his initiative in appointing an Adviser on the question of sexual exploitation and abuse, Prince Zeid of Jordan. The EU has been encouraged by the sense of urgency shared by the members of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations last year following publication of the report prepared by Prince Zeid (A\/59\/710). Last April the Special Committee made a number of recommendations for urgent action, addressed to the Secretary-General, to the Secretariat and to Member States themselves. The central theme underlying those recommendations is the need to establish and implement a policy of zero tolerance towards sexual exploitation and abuse in United Nations peacekeeping operations.  In May last year (see S\/PV.5191), the Security Council added further momentum to these efforts when it welcomed the Special Committee's report (A\/59\/19\/Add.1) and called on the Secretary-General and on troop-contributing countries to ensure implementation of the recommendations without delay. The Security Council also set itself the task of considering inclusion of provisions on prevention, monitoring, investigation and reporting of misconduct cases in its own resolutions concerning peacekeeping mandates. We are pleased to see that the Council has since acted along those lines on several occasions.  The European Union welcomes the opportunity offered by today's meeting to press for renewed efforts to ensure speedy implementation of all outstanding recommendations from the Special Committee's report. The time line for full implementation of those recommendations - no later than 1 June 2007 - must be respected.  As regards achievements to date, the EU is pleased to see that the Secretariat has already taken some of the steps that fall within its purview and has set in train measures to implement others. The EU welcomes the Secretariat's work on a revised draft model memorandum of understanding for troop contributors and hopes that these efforts will lead to its adoption by the General Assembly before the end of its sixtieth session. The EU is also pleased to see the progress on establishing a professional and independent investigative capacity in the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS). It is crucial that effective cooperation be assured between OIOS and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO). The EU encourages collaboration between troop-contributing countries and the OIOS investigative capacity in order to ensure that any evidence collected is admissible in the relevant national jurisdiction. That is vital in the fight against impunity for acts of misconduct.  Given the importance of keeping the interests of the victims, female and male, adults and children, at the forefront of all these efforts, the EU also warmly welcomes the Secretariat's progress in developing a bold and comprehensive policy on support to victims of sexual exploitation and abuse. We look forward to discussion on this in the upcoming session of the Special Committee. Likewise, the EU strongly supports the establishment of a sufficient number of conduct and discipline teams to meet the need for such capacity in peacekeeping missions, and it favours the transformation of the present Headquarters team into a permanent conduct and discipline unit in DPKO, as proposed by the Secretary-General in his report.  High standards of conduct and discipline must be applied to all categories of peacekeeping personnel. A particular responsibility rests with us, the Member States, to train, to prepare and to hold accountable members of national contingents, including at the very senior level.  The EU has taken measures to ensure that there is a policy of zero tolerance of sexual exploitation and abuse by personnel participating in its own European Security and Defence Policy operations. Though individual EU member States retain jurisdiction over their national troop and police contingents, the European Union has taken steps to standardize the norms of behaviour for all categories of personnel participating in such operations. Moreover, those generic standards clarify the responsibilities of senior commanders and management, require their incorporation into the planning documents of every operation under the European Security and Defence Policy, call for the establishment of complaint procedures and reporting mechanisms and require the inclusion of education on the standards of behaviour into national as well as EU-level pre-deployment training.  None of us should become complacent on a subject as serious as this. The EU remains fully committed to intensifying its efforts, and it encourages the wider United Nations membership and the Secretariat to remain so as well.  ",
    " I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for having taken the initiative to hold a public meeting of the Security Council on this very serious matter affecting the Organization. I would also like to express appreciation to Mr. Guehenno for the efforts the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) is making to combat sexual exploitation and abuse. My thanks go also to Prince Zeid for his briefing updating us on efforts to eradicate those crimes since 31 May 2005.  We believe it very appropriate that the Security Council should take up the subject of sexual exploitation and abuse. Such crimes are a perversion of the spirit and letter of the Charter. They are crimes that cut to the humanist heart of the Organization - the defence of human rights. Ultimately, they undermine the legitimacy of peacekeeping operations and the international community's confidence in the functioning of our multilateral system for peace.  As has been said, we, the Member States, must have zero tolerance for cases of sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping operations. In order to do away with such crimes, we must implement preventive measures and apply exemplary punishment through due process. We therefore welcome the efforts of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to prevent the entrenchment within the United Nations of what was called a few days ago a culture of inaction, which could lead to a culture of impunity. With regard to preventive measures, my delegation supports the annexing to memorandums of  understanding - the agreements that govern the participation of Member States in peacekeeping operations - a code of conduct that personnel must  observe. Such a code of conduct will enable States - Governments, which have responsibility in this area - to have full prior knowledge of the ethical and legal commitments required of their troops taking part in a peacekeeping operation. Furthermore, the training process should be intensified with a view to ensuring, if possible, that every single peacekeeper is trained. Information and training should also be provided to multilateral forces authorized by the United Nations with regard to the Geneva Conventions, the Convention against Torture and other relevant human rights instruments.  According to the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the recommendations of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations (A\/60\/640 and Add.1), between January 2004 and October 2005 investigations were carried out into accusations of acts of sexual abuse and exploitation committed by 264 peacekeeping personnel. However, more up-to-date figures indicate that there may be as many as 400 accusations. That means that, over the past two years, approximately 25 per cent of the accusations made have not been investigated. That may be the result of a lack of sufficient human and financial resources to carry out the investigations.  Another aspect of sexual exploitation and abuse is the reluctance of the victims themselves to denounce such criminal acts - reluctance that might be due to ignorance or, perhaps, to their reverential feelings towards international authorities.  One system that could prove helpful would be the establishment of some sort of office of ombudsman for peacekeeping operations that would work in the field and report directly to Member States on acts of sexual exploitation and abuse. Moreover, the ombudsman would ensure that factual information could be obtained directly in the field, allowing the victim and the defendant to provide their own version of the incident. Such a practice would allow for greater due process in the investigation and sanctions system.  In his report, the Secretary-General states that, in the second half of this year, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations will establish a general  database to track such crimes. In that regard, we believe that the database should be even broader than that described in the report. It should not only identify the accused, but provide information on the accusers, as well as on allegations under investigation and the reasons why other allegations have not been investigated.  It is said that the United Nations sends its peacekeeping forces to do work that no one else wants to do. Now we are faced with an aberration, whereby wicked elements in peacekeeping operations do what no one wants them to do - that is, perpetrate sexual exploitation and abuse. I conclude by stressing that, in response to the crimes of sexual exploitation and abuse, Member States must cooperate and initiate a policy of zero tolerance. Disciplinary bodies must be created so that the United Nations does not lose its legitimacy in world public opinion.  ",
    " Let me begin by thanking you, Mr. President, for convening this meeting and thereby once again directing the attention of the Security Council to the indispensable role of women in all efforts to build and maintain peace and security. Let me also thank all four speakers for their introductions to our debate this morning. Furthermore, I would like to associate my delegation with the statement to be delivered later by the Permanent Representative of Finland on behalf of the European Union.  Last year, Denmark warmly welcomed the United Nations System-wide Action Plan for the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). This year, the report of the Secretary-General (S\/2006\/770) presents an overview of achievements, gaps and challenges, as well as recommendations for future action for implementation of the Plan. The report clearly indicates that much has been done but also that much more needs to be done, and done better.  Guidelines, workshops and new gender-inclusive procedures are important stepping-stones, tools for proper implementation and for achieving the objectives. But what is the impact of such initiatives? Have they made a difference for women and girls on the ground? The sad answer is, we do not really know.  According to the report, a number of gaps and challenges remain. Let me underline a few of these. Strong commitment, leadership and accountability at the highest level in the United Nations are key to progress. To this, we can all agree. But the report underlines that lack of leadership and commitment to pursue the implementation of the Action Plan both in intergovernmental bodies and in the United Nations system is one of the serious weaknesses affecting the implementation of the resolution. Despite the Security Council's many strategic initiatives to promote gender equality and support the empowerment of women, its attention to gender issues is not systematic.  It is furthermore incomprehensible that, in the United Nations in 2006, there is, in the words of the report, \"lack of a common understanding of gender and gender mainstreaming and especially of their practical application\" (S\/2006\/7 70, para. 23). The use of gender advisers in peacekeeping operations by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) has improved capacity. However, to really make a difference, gender advisers must be appointed at the senior level, and their efforts must be matched by the allocation of necessary resources. It is a management responsibility to implement resolution 1325 (2000). I welcome the efforts undertaken by Under-Secretary-General Guehenno in this regard. The report must be credited for unveiling weaknesses in accountability mechanisms. We all know that what is measured gets done, and Denmark strongly urges that the Action Plan be transformed into a results-based programming, monitoring and reporting tool.  Denmark places high expectations in the Peacebuilding Commission's ability to further develop and strengthen the necessary cooperation and coordination between the various actors involved and their civilian and military instruments and capabilities. Needless to say, the provisions of resolution 1325 (2000) must be important guiding principles for the work of the Peacebuilding Commission.  At the national level, in 2005, Denmark launched a National Action Plan for the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). The Plan will now be revised in the light of experiences gained by all relevant Danish actors and their partners working in situations of crisis and conflict. We also co-sponsored a workshop in Dubai, at which the United Nations Mine Action Team worked with the United Nations and national staff from Yemen, Jordan, Afghanistan, Iraq and the occupied Palestinian territories to ensure that their mine action programmes promote gender equality. We intend to follow up on the conference to further promote gender equality in mine action.  In another effort to implement resolution 1325 (2000), Denmark requested the International Crisis Group to examine the role of women in peacebuilding in three of Africa's most deadly conflicts. The report contained discouraging findings that women are marginalized in peace processes, grossly underrepresented in the security sector as a whole, and largely excluded from the formal economy. And what about resolution 1325 (2000)? The resolution was by and large unknown among the actors at the country and grass-roots levels.  Six years after the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) the challenge remains. Our political support for the resolution must be transformed into visible and documented impact for the millions of women and girls affected by conflicts.  ",
    " I am honoured to address the Council for the first time as Secretary- General on the vital subject of women and peace and security. We have gathered to discuss the implementation of a landmark resolution. Since the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), seven years ago, Member States have made significant progress. More and more, women are participating in mediating and negotiating peace, in searching for justice, in fostering reconciliation, in supporting disarmament and demobilization and in shaping development policies and rebuilding institutions.  More and more, the Security Council is ensuring that peace processes empower women and advance gender equality. More and more, United Nations entities are working closely and actively with Governments and women's organizations, including through the United Nations System-wide Action Plan on implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). 07-55817 But there is so much left to do, both for the United Nations and for Member States. More countries in conflict or post-conflict situations need to establish their own national action plans. They need to take greater ownership of programmes and priorities in implementing resolution 1325 (2000). They need to identify the capacity-building and the technical and financial support needed to scale up programmes for implementation, and they need to strengthen approaches to monitoring, evaluation and accountability.  For our part, we in the United Nations system must take a more evenly coordinated approach than we have done so far. We need to work better with Governments to establish truly joint programmes driven by national priorities. We need to clarify the roles and responsibilities of United Nations entities at the country level. We need to work better as a team, so as to give countries access to a common entry point.  And we need to appoint more women in leadership positions in our peace operations around the world. I am delighted that Ambassador Ellen Margrethe L\u00c2\u00a2j of Denmark has agreed to serve as my Special Representative for Liberia. She will be heading one of our biggest peacekeeping missions, and I know she will provide a shining example of the kind of qualities we need in our leaders in the field.  Violence against women has reached hideous and pandemic proportions in some societies attempting to recover from conflict. Together, all of us need to strengthen our collective and individual responses to it. That is essential if we are to reverse the damage done by conflict and to build more inclusive, accountable and cohesive societies, underpinned by viable democratic institutions.  Earlier this year, I urged the Security Council to establish a mechanism dedicated to monitoring violence against women and girls within the framework of resolution 1325 (2000). I reiterate that call today. I also encourage Member States to actively consider proposals to strengthen the Organization's gender architecture, as presented by the High-level Panel on United Nations System-wide Coherence. I believe we could significantly advance our cause by replacing several current structures with one dynamic United Nations entity. Such a new body should be able to call on all of the United Nations system's resources in the work to empower women and realize gender equality 07-55817  worldwide. It should mobilize forces of change at the global level and inspire enhanced results at the country level.  We all have a collective role and responsibility in accelerating the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) -the Security Council, Member States, the United Nations system, other international and regional actors and civil society. On this anniversary of its adoption, let us rededicate ourselves to that mission.  ",
    " First of all, I would like to express my delegation's gratitude to the briefers for their presentations and to the Ghanaian presidency for organizing this important debate on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security.  Slovakia fully associates itself with the statement to be delivered later by the representative of Portugal on behalf of the European Union.  Slovakia strongly supports the full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), which represents a concrete and effective tool for the promotion and protection of the rights of women in conflict and post-conflict situations. The active and equal participation of women in conflict prevention, peacebuilding and peacekeeping, including in peace and reconciliation efforts, represents the best way to eliminate gender-based violence, sexual abuse and all other forms of violence against women in conflict situations. Women's empowerment plays a critical role in peace and security processes.  In this respect, we welcome the second follow-up report of the Secretary-General (S\/2007\/567) on the implementation of the United Nations System-Wide Action Plan for 2005-2007, as well as the proposed further actions for the period 2008-2009. We are pleased with the reported progress in the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) on a truly system-wide scale. However, we are very well aware that there is still much to be done.  The mainstreaming of the gender perspective in conflict prevention, including the development of gender-sensitive early warning mechanisms, increased participation by women in peacekeeping operations and decision-making and gender training for all staff, have been promoted by action plans and other important initiatives within United Nations entities, such as the Department of Political Affairs, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the Office for Disarmament Affairs, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Food Programme (WFP).  An appropriate presence of women and gender training in armed forces, including peacekeeping forces, have a clear and positive effect on the behaviour of troops and on the actual conduct of their duty. Therefore, the provisions of resolution 1325 (2000) are fully relevant for any security sector reform plan. In this context, we welcome activities linked with the promotion of women's participation in peacekeeping, peacebuilding and the development of specific action plans for the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) by the field missions of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.  We also very much appreciate the work of UNICEF, which has provided gender training for 500 staff members of the international organizations based in the Sudan, and which, in cooperation with Save the Children, has provided gender training for 3,300 military observers, protection forces and civilian police officers in Darfur. I would also mention the training provided by OHCHR to military and police personnel deployed in peacekeeping operations. The activities of the United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women, the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces, the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe are also commendable in this area.  Gender perspective has also been mainstreamed in some humanitarian assistance programmes, as well as in the areas of post-conflict reconstruction and rehabilitation. In those areas, for example, the World Food Programme assisted States in gender mainstreaming in food security programmes and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda provided gender training for investigators and legal personnel, establishing gender-sensitive policies and mechanisms to coordinate the rehabilitation of witnesses.  The special needs of women and girls have been reflected in the majority of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes. In Liberia, for example, 22,370 women and 2,440 girls out of some 100,000 ex-combatants were disarmed, demobilized and reintegrated into the community. The efforts of UNICEF and non-governmental organizations led to the release of over 1,000 women and girls from armed forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and of over 800 girls in Sri Lanka.  Despite the tangible progress achieved in the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) at the level of the United Nations system, we remain extremely concerned about the actual situation of women and girls in conflict situations, where they continue to face all possible forms of violence. I will not go into the horrible details and recall the stories of women and girls heard by the Council during the recent Arria- formula meeting organized by France. Our particular concerns are linked with rape and other forms of sexual violence on an enormous scale, which are often systematically used as a tool of war.  Slovakia strongly condemns such crimes and supports the use of all available means to put an end to the impunity of perpetrators. In that respect, we also reiterate our full support for the zero-tolerance policy with respect to crimes committed by United Nations personnel.  We believe that national authorities and the whole international community must respond more effectively to widespread sexual violence in situations of armed conflict, and that their responses need to be based on reliable information. Slovakia therefore fully supports the idea of establishing a comprehensive and effective monitoring and reporting mechanism that will help to identify the victims, patterns, real scale and perpetrators of sexual violence in the context of armed conflicts. We firmly believe that more detailed and focused monitoring could lead to more effective measures by Governments, the United Nations system, civil society and all other actors working on the ground.

    " At the outset, allow me to congratulate the Ghanaian presidency on its able stewardship of the Council this month and to thank it for convening this open debate on women and peace and security.  As we mark the seventh anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), I also wish to thank the Secretary-General, the Under-Secretary- General for Peacekeeping Operations and Ms. Rachel Mayanja for their informative statements.  Next year, the international community will reach another milestone when it celebrates the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Declaration, universally recognized as an international instrument of the highest importance, is of increasing significance as a unifying factor among all peoples and cultures. It remains a living document that continues to inform and inspire the struggle for rights and freedoms of all people around the world. In this regard, the spirit of resolution 1325 (2000) lives and breathes within the Declaration.  My delegation would like to commend the efforts of the various entities within the United Nations, among them, the Division for the Advancement of Women, the United Nations Development Fund for Women and the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women for their efforts in promoting resolution 1325 (2000) and for all that they do to make the voices of women heard.  Israel strongly believes that women must play an equal role in all aspects of State and civil society. We have no doubt that the advancement and progress of women will translate into nothing less than the advancement and progress for all. As such, Israel remains committed to the principles and goals of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, as well as the principles outlined in the World Summit Outcome (General Assembly resolution 60\/1) adopted by our leaders in 2005.  The deliberate acts of violence against women and the girl child, especially in situations of armed conflict, are particularly alarming. Women, and children, for that matter, are severely affected by the consequences of armed conflict. We have even seen and are continuing, unfortunately, to see the heinous crime of rape used as a political weapon. The severity of such graphic exploitation, abuse and violation of human rights cannot be overstated, and the perpetrators of these crimes must be brought to justice.  Israel welcomes the report of the Secretary- General on women and peace and security (S\/2007\/567) and its System-wide Action Plan review and update. Similarly, we are pleased at the Secretary- General's efforts to identify women as candidates for senior level positions within the United Nations system, with particular attention given to special representatives. We hope to hear in the future of new appointments of women in senior roles.  With this in mind, we commend the appointment of our former colleague, Ambassador Ellen Loj, as the new Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Liberia. I am sure that her impressive tenure at the United Nations, and especially in the Security Council, will have prepared her well for this important mission, and we wish her well.  Nevertheless, a great deal remains to be done. National mechanisms and machineries for the advancement of women need to be strengthened to ensure women's active participation in public policy formulation on matters of peace and security. The mainstreaming of gender into all policies and programmes at the international and national levels is a crucial factor in the prevention of sexual discrimination, exploitation and abuse. If women are ever to truly see their needs recognized and their interests represented in peace accords, they must have access to peace negotiations from the earliest possible stages. In that regard, Israel has been working through Government and non-governmental channels to increase awareness and amplify the voice of women in peace negotiations and conflict resolution. In Israel, implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) continues on a variety of levels, including but not limited to distributing Hebrew translations of the resolution, distributing and disseminating information  on the resolution to national, regional and non- governmental organization (NGO) bodies, campaigning to raise awareness through public relations work and media coverage and monitoring and documenting the impact of conflict on women and girls. Similarly, the Israeli Women's Equal Rights Law was amended in past years in the spirit of resolution 1325 (2000) mandating that the Israeli Government include women in any group appointed to peacebuilding negotiations and conflict resolution.  I wish to note that this commitment is not merely in theory, but also in practice. We do not just preach it; we practice it. My Minister, Ms. Tzipi Livni, Vice- Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, was appointed just last week to lead the negotiations with the Palestinians. Due to the important choices being made on the ground - namely, the existence of a Palestinian Government that accepts the Quartet principles and is committed to a dialogue and process with Israel - a sense of renewed hope and optimism can be felt on the ground. As Israeli and Palestinian leaders continue to meet, our goal is to reach an understanding on the widest possible common ground in order to enable progress on the way forward towards the realization of the two-State vision. This is for the benefit of all citizens of the region, men and women alike. Similarly, there is a movement of Israeli and Palestinian women working together from across civil society and the political spectrum to advocate for peace. The recognition and effectiveness of such advocacy organizations and NGOs is a testament to the vibrancy of Israeli democracy and pluralism, and Israel takes great pride in their leadership.  Spinoza, the famed seventeenth-century philosopher, once said that peace is not the absence of war: it is a virtue, a state of mind, a disposition for benevolence, confidence and justice. Indeed, peace is a holistic state of existence. To truly achieve it, one half of the population cannot be ignored. Only with full participation of women in all aspects of conflict resolution, peacemaking and security will there be a viable social, economic and political subsoil for democratization, sustainable development and peace to grow.  Israel, for its part, is determined that women should play an increasingly active role in peace negotiations and is committed to advancing the role of women in all aspects of society. Israel is hopeful that an enhanced role for women in peace negotiations will  build lasting bridges of understanding with our neighbours and usher in a dawn of harmony and prosperity for all.  ",
    " Allow me at the outset to thank you, Sir, for your presence at this important meeting and to extend to the permanent mission of Ghana to the United Nations my sincere thanks for its thorough preparations for this open debate.  I would also like to extend my thanks to Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno, Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations; Ms. Rachel Mayanja, Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women; Ms. Joanne Sandler, Ad Interim Executive Director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women; and Ms. Gina Torry, Coordinator of the NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security, for their briefings today.  The State of Qatar firmly believes that women are key partners in all efforts towards and stages in the maintenance and strengthening of international peace and security. It also believes in the priority of the ongoing work to integrate women into all peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations and in the development of national policies for the consolidation of peace in areas of armed conflict. The State of Qatar strongly condemns all sexual and physical abuse of women and girls in areas of armed conflict. The State of Qatar stresses the need to provide them with comprehensive protection and to take firm action against those who sexually abuse women and girls in areas of armed conflict, be they parties to the conflict or United Nations peacekeeping operations personnel, in order to put an end to impunity.  We have reviewed the report of the Secretary- General on the implementation of the United Nations System-wide Action Plan for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) for the years 2005-2007. In that regard, we commend the efforts and activities carried out by all the entities of the United Nations, which have made significant progress in many areas of the Plan. It is reassuring to note that the review process indicates an increase in the political commitment to gender equality, the empowerment of women in peace processes, and the strengthening of capacity-building, especially in the area of women's full participation in all stages of peace processes, including in negotiating and implementing peace agreements and in the development of new mechanisms for monitoring and reporting on the status of women and their contributions to peace processes.  With regard to addressing all forms of violence against women and children in armed conflict, including sexual violence, and to addressing the issue of impunity from prosecution for such crimes, we commend the efforts of United Nations entities in carrying out the United Nations zero-tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse committed by their personnel; in providing support to Member States in their efforts to align their national legal systems with the relevant international standards; and in cooperating in the area of national capacity-building in the fight against those crimes and against impunity. We also commend the Governments concerned for their cooperation, which is essential for the success of any plan intended to put an end to this phenomenon.  Despite the progress that has been made, many institutional and organizational challenges must still be addressed to achieve universal implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). The Governments of post- conflict countries and countries affected by conflict bear the primary responsibility for the implementation of that resolution. While such countries have established national mechanisms for the advancement of women, they need financial and technical support to ensure active participation by women in the formulation of policies and programmes relating to the establishment and consolidation of peace and security. In that respect, the Secretary-General has pointed out in his report the inadequate funding of gender-related projects in peace processes and post-conflict peacebuilding. Overcoming these challenges does not require the creation of new mechanisms and bodies or the submission of new reports. That would entail a waste of money and effort that could be better spent to improve and strengthen existing mechanisms. With regard to monitoring and follow-up, the Secretary- General should include in his periodic reports to the Security Council on various of armed conflicts an assessment of progress made in mainstreaming the gender perspective in all peacekeeping and peacebuilding missions and data on all forms of violence against women and children, including killing and maiming and sexual violence committed by the parties to the conflict and by peacekeeping personnel. Those reports must also include best practices and lessons learned in the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  Turning to national implementation, the successful implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) requires enhancing the capacity of the United Nations peace support, humanitarian and post-conflict reconstruction operations to backstop the efforts of Member States in strengthening their national capacities, in line with national objectives and the relevant international standards, to achieve gender equality, the empowerment of women in the area of peace and security, success in the fight against all forms of violence, especially violence against women and children, and the eradication of the culture of impunity. Success also requires paying special attention to countries emerging from conflict, which need financial and technical support in the preparation of national plans of action to implement resolution 1325 (2000). We commend the effort to take that objective into account in the formulation of the United Nations System-wide Plan of Action for implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) for the period 2008-2009. We also stress the importance of continued financial and technical support, the lack of which could make the objective of achieving the global implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) elusive. We will support the draft presidential statement that is before the Security Council, which enjoys consensus.  ",
    " I wish to express my delegation's gratitude to you, Sir, for having convened this open debate on women and peace and security, and for following up on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  It is of the utmost importance to share experiences and points of view vis-a-vis the design of a coherent and effective strategy for implementing resolution 1325 (2000). In its capacity as a member of the \"friends of 1325\", Colombia attaches special importance to that process, in which it has participated since its earliest stages. Our participation is guided by the conviction that the effective promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women in the areas of peace and security is critical. The United Nations system can effectively contribute to the fulfilment of the responsibilities incumbent on States in those areas through specific cooperation initiatives.  In that regard, we note with satisfaction the Secretary-General's acknowledgement in his report of 12 September, 2007, of the significant progress that has been achieved in the implementation of the aforementioned resolution. The report states that  \"One of the major lessons learned from the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) in 2005-2007 is that without concerted efforts with Governments and civil society at the country level, the implementation of the resolution would remain elusive\" (A\/2007\/56 7, para. 36).  That is particularly true for Colombia, where interaction between civil society and the United Nations system has been an ongoing factor in the drafting and implementation of comprehensive approaches to programmes for the advancement of women and the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). Through democratic security policies, economic recovery, social equity and human development, Colombia has made notable progress in that field. In Colombia, the Office of the Presidential Adviser for Women's Equity and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs established a series of round tables on women, peace and security, which have conducted assessments and promoted awareness of resolution 1325 (2000) and of the country report on its implementation. A group of women from different regions have also received training in conflict prevention and conflict resolution. The constant support of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and the help of many non- governmental organizations have enabled the Government to conduct an important number of activities, initiatives and projects designed to promote and implement resolution 1325 (2000) and to mainstream gender issues in national policies.  That is reflected in the National Development Plan 2006-2010, and I would like to highlight some of the Plan's activities with respect to affirmative action, a cross-cutting approach to gender and social reactivation.  Colombia is implementing an affirmative action policy entitled \"Women - Builders of peace and development\". The policy prioritizes goals related to employment and enterprise development, education and culture, political participation and the prevention of violence against women. It includes more than 100 protection measures, to be applied by various authorities, to counter domestic violence, marriage breakdown and labour discrimination.  The cross-cutting approach to gender involves all State agencies. Its results are reflected in laws, jurisprudence and public policies with a gender perspective, in strengthening institutional mechanisms working on women's issues, and in consolidating disaggregated information systems, among other things. I would like to highlight four structural strategies within the social reactivation policy that promote greater gender equality: human capital development and employment, consolidation of the social security system, a network for comprehensive attention to the population living in extreme poverty and the promotion of microcredit.  I would also like to highlight the helpful role that the Organization of American States has played at the regional level, through the Inter-American Commission of Women. Following up on the mandates of the Inter- American Program on the Promotion of Women's  Human Rights and Gender Equity and Equality and the Inter-American Democratic Charter, the Commission conducted the Training Course on Gender, Conflict and Peace-Building for the Andean and Central American regions. The recommendations of that project are particularly relevant for our debate today, since they underline how it is possible to build an agenda from the regional perspective that contributes to the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  In the report of the Secretary-General on women and peace and security, it is stated that Governments have the primary responsibility for implementing the resolution. With that understanding, Colombia appreciates the role that the Security Council has played in guiding and revitalizing, through resolution 1325 (2000) and its plan of action, the process of consultation with concerned entities of the United Nations system and civil society organizations to cooperate with Governments to meet their commitments within the framework of that resolution.  On the other hand, we understand that in pursuing these issues, the Security Council contributes substantially to the preservation of peace and security, which supports its central mandate as contained in the United Nations Charter. Colombia welcomes the recommendation contained in the report of the Secretary-General on women and peace and security that the United Nations system accelerate the development of a comprehensive knowledge and information system, accessible to Member States, in order to share good practices and lessons learned in the implementation of the resolution. That type of initiative should be added in a positive manner to the national and regional initiatives aimed at strengthening national capacity-building for the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  We also believe that broad and inclusive intergovernmental consultations concerning analysis of the gender architecture and the advancement of women, and consensus among States, are essential preconditions for ensuring that the models and practices adopted are properly legitimate and effective.  In that regard, and particularly concerning the possibility that accountability mechanisms may be established in the context of the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), we underscore the contribution of the General Assembly to strengthening the cooperation with States in those complex tasks. At the same time, we note with reservations the suggestions that have been made concerning the recommendation of the Secretary-General that Member States strengthen monitoring and accountability for the national implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), in particular through the establishment of a Security Council mechanism to monitor national implementation. My country considers that this recommendation is not appropriate, because it would eventually result in the creation of a mechanism whereby the Security Council would single out countries on the basis of thematic issues that should, according to the United Nations Charter, be discussed and dealt with in the General Assembly. We agree to the additional work that should be done towards the protection of the rights of women, as long as they remain under the purview of the existing United Nations forums in the area of human rights.  The approach that results from a mechanism such as the one that has been suggested does not seem to be the most appropriate for achieving sustainable solutions. We would always rather have cooperation, constructive dialogue and real support to countries when they are dealing with issues that concern human rights.  Seven years after the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), Colombia has achieved important progress in strengthening the role and capacity of women and in the fulfilment of their rights. For our country, it is a matter of great importance to continue to have the support of the United Nations Systems on these issues, in the context of elaborating a positive agenda. It is in that spirit that my delegation will continue to actively participate in the consideration of this important issue.  ",
    " On behalf of the United Arab Emirates, I have the honour of thanking you, Sir, for your delegation's fine efforts in the presidency of the Security Council for the month of October, including the initiative to organize today's open debate on the role of women and peace and security.  Seven years have passed since the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), which established an approach and a clear Action Plan designed to protect of women during armed conflict and to promote of their participation in conflict prevention. However, we are far from achieving the desired objectives in this area, particularly at a time when the reports and statistics from conflict areas are unanimous in the view that women and children are still the principal victims in these conflicts. In most cases, they are the main target of combatants and armed factions and are deliberately subjected to different forms of attack, ethnic cleansing and forced displacement, among other human rights violations.  The United Arab Emirates is following with satisfaction the United Nations Action Plan covering the period 2005-2007 on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), including the achievements in the areas of monitoring, evaluation and accountability. We reiterate that this Plan still needs more evaluation and development in order to address shortcomings, in particular those created by insufficient funding for gender-related projects. Another shortcoming is weak institutional capacity in monitoring and accountability and the universalization of gender perspective.  We strongly condemn the prevalence of all acts of aggression and violence against women and girls in armed conflict and in post-conflict situations. We underscore the need for cooperation between the entities of the United Nations system, in particular the Peacebuilding Commission, for which the United Arab Emirates has provided support. We have contributed to the budget of the Peacebuilding Commission, as well as to those of several organizations, civil society and institutions, relevant governmental and regional non-governmental working groups in order to achieve full implementation of the provisions of this resolution, including the full empowerment of women in the fields of peacekeeping and peacebuilding and the implementation of development and humanitarian operations.  If these goals can be achieved, countries will be helped more effectively to strengthen their respective legislation and training activities aimed at the prevention of gender-based violence in armed conflict, as well as improving the institutional environment for accountability, monitoring and reporting on the situation of women and for ensuring their full and effective participation in political, security and social areas of activity.  We support the efforts made so far to rethink the United Nations Action Plan for the period covering 2008-2009 and transform it from a mere instrument for programming, monitoring and preparing reports to an effective tool that will promote the role of women in the five main thematic areas of prevention, participation, protection, relief and recovery and the normative sphere. Nonetheless, we wish to stress the following points.  First, there is a need to fully involve Governments and civil society in the implementation of the Action Plan. This is in addition to giving continuous support and development assistance to countries emerging from conflict so as to help them finance their gender-related and human rights projects and to design and implement comprehensive national plans involving women, thus empowering them fully and effectively, particularly in the fields of peace and security, in accordance with the provisions of resolution 1325 (2000).  Secondly, we need to adopt the gender perspective in all peacekeeping operations and other relevant activities, including women's increased involvement in decision-making processes so as to mitigate the negative impact of illegal activities perpetrated against them, including acts committed by individuals participating in such activities. We must find innovative ways of training and application in order to facilitate women's participation in elections, government and post-conflict reconstruction efforts, such as those adopted by the World Food Programme.  Thirdly, there is a need to improve mechanisms for the immediate reporting of violations of the human rights of women in areas of armed conflict, including rape and other forms of sexual violence.  Fourthly, we must strengthen national, regional and international legislation to end impunity for those who commit sexual violence against women. We must also endeavour to establish independent and neutral commissions and tribunals to prosecute and punish perpetrators of war crimes and those who commit rape during wartime.  Fifthly, a comprehensive international system must be established to provide information to all Member States and facilitate the exchange of best practices and lessons learned with regard to strengthening the role of women in the area of peace and security.  Sixthly, comprehensive public information and awareness programmes must be developed, especially for countries in conflict or emerging from conflict, in order to promote the full implementation of international humanitarian and human rights law protecting the human rights of women and girls during armed conflict.  The United Arab Emirates has made great strides in empowering women and integrating them in all areas of our society, including in the political, economic and social spheres, as well as in human services and civil defence. We have also endeavoured to participate in peacekeeping operations in many areas of armed conflict, so as to alleviate the suffering of injured and displaced people, the majority of whom are women and children.  The United Arab Emirates would like to express its continuing concern about the dismal situation of victimized women throughout Palestine as a result of the ongoing Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory and its repressive practices against women and their families. A similar situation prevails in Iraq as a result of acts of violence and terrorist bombings. Such acts constitute some of the gravest violations of international humanitarian norms and laws, including the Fourth Geneva Convention, of 1949. We therefore reiterate our call on the international community to shoulder its responsibility in the implementation of all relevant United Nations resolutions. We would also like to underscore that, without the necessary political will, those regions will continue to live in insecurity and instability, which serve to fuel violence against women.  In conclusion, we hope that our debate on this item will lead to the adoption of an integrated international, institutional approach to the issue of women and peace and security in order to make a positive contribution to improving the status of women in today's world.  ",
    " May I first commend the President for the presidential statement that will be adopted at the conclusion of this debate. We particularly welcome the request to include in relevant reporting of the Secretary-General greater 07-55957 disaggregated data on the impact of armed conflicts on women and girls. May I also welcome the recent appointment of Ms. Ellen Loj as Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Liberia, which makes her the only woman among the more than 20 Special Representatives of the Secretary-General across the political and peacekeeping missions of the United Nations. So, it is indeed a cause for celebration.  New Zealand recognizes the important role that women play in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peacebuilding, and we strongly support Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). Our commitment to the resolution is reflected in our national, regional and international approach to peacebuilding, conflict prevention and conflict resolution.  We welcome the advances that have been made in those areas by the United Nations system and by Member States. We appreciate the Secretary-General's 2007 report on women and peace and security (S\/2007\/567) and the many positive examples it describes of the progressive work happening in this field. We are pleased to note the work done to restructure the Organization's implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) under the 2008-2009 United Nations System-Wide Action Plan, as well as the Plan's increased focus on accountability, monitoring and reporting.  New Zealand is taking a number of concrete steps to reinforce its support for resolution 1325 (2000). First, we are committed to encouraging women to undertake assignments on peacekeeping missions. Women from the New Zealand Defence Forces, the New Zealand Police and our wider society are an integral part of New Zealand's participation in regional, United Nations and other international peacekeeping efforts. That includes women working in high-risk areas, such as Afghanistan, and in our operational missions, such as that in Timor-Leste. Up to 30 per cent of all our police peacekeeping deployments are female - among the highest rate in the world. New Zealand recognizes, too, that diversity assists peacekeeping missions in reaching out to a wider sector of the community, which is a fundamental element for effective peacebuilding.  Secondly, this year New Zealand was proud to withdraw its final reservation to the Convention on the 5 Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, which concerned women in the armed forces.  Thirdly, I should like to say that the New Zealand Defence Force recently approved a diversity strategy, which we call \"Valuing Diversity: Leadership in Action\". The strategy recognizes the value of the full integration of women, the positive effect that it has on morale and the sense of belonging to a wider team in which all members can make meaningful contributions. This approach also recognizes the benefits of having more women at senior levels of the Defence Force. We have worked hard to ensure the integration of women at all levels and in all areas of the New Zealand Defence Force, including combat. We are increasing the number of women in the higher ranks, and we are becoming more effective in retaining women in the Force throughout their careers.  New Zealand's response to resolution 1325 (2000) is proactive. We appreciate the fact that, even in peacetime, it is important to ensure the security of women. New Zealand is currently involved in the Pacific Prevention of Domestic Violence Programme, a joint initiative of New Zealand's International Aid and Development Agency (NZAID), the New Zealand Police and the Pacific Islands Chiefs of Police organization. Members of the New Zealand Police deliver advice, training and operational support on domestic violence to police forces and communities across the Pacific. This initiative focuses on regional coordination and benchmarking, police capability, relationship-building, the strengthening of Government policy and legislation, a whole-Government approach to domestic violence and ways to influence social change.  In closing, I would like to assure the Security Council that New Zealand, through its development cooperation programmes, peacekeeping efforts and domestic policies, will continue to seek ways to enhance and strengthen the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  ",
    " Mr. President, at the outset, I would like to thank you for convening this open debate on women and peace and security and to extend our gratitude to the Secretariat for the report submitted today to the Council on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and related plans and programmes (S\/2007\/567).  The report of the Secretary-General undoubtedly reflects an enormous effort to follow up implementation of the 2005-2007 Action Plan, as well as to formulate the new Action Plan for 2008-2009. It reflects growing interest by all entities of the United Nations system, along with necessary efficiency, in particular on the part of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General, the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW) and other relevant bodies.  Yet there are many questions that require responses in order to achieve the desired coherence among activities at the level of the Organization and the activities of Member States, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector in implementation of the resolution and the Action Plan. First and foremost, this requires effectively addressing the institutional gaps and challenges identified by the Secretary-General and relating to internal administrative matters. These are caused, on the one hand, by a lack of non-core resources from voluntary contributions, and on the other, by the lack of a clear vision of the ultimate result, which differs from case to case. Another cause is the lack of effective reporting and evaluation on the substantive impact of the Organization's efforts on the ground. Lastly, there is a failure to recognize the vital role that can be played by the Peacebuilding Commission in designing the conceptual framework for addressing this issue, particularly in post-conflict situations, as reflected in operative paragraph 17 of General Assembly resolution 61\/143.  Furthermore, it requires us - not only in the Security Council but throughout the United Nations -  to formulate a clear system-wide action plan to deal with the issues with the participation of all principal organs, through the simultaneous adoption of resolutions by the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council.  The serious issue before us does not need scrutiny by Member States through the establishment of a monitoring mechanism to guarantee full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and the Action Plan, as suggested by the Secretary-General. Rather, what it needs is a collective international effort to strengthen the capacity of States to help with implementation and to provide the financial resources and technical expertise needed to make progress possible.  Egypt attaches great importance to the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) within a holistic framework that mobilizes the efforts of all Governments, civil society and the private sector, and is fully prepared to see the resolution implemented throughout the Arab world and Africa. The Government of Egypt has supported many activities related to the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), the Action Plan and the related programmes and has assisted other countries on the African continent to address the matter effectively. We have done this by providing direct technical assistance and trilateral cooperation with other partners. The Suzanne Mubarak Women's International Peace Movement, one of the major non-governmental organizations in this field, has provided great assistance in that regard. It has done so by convening a series of regional meetings through which governmental and non-governmental organizations support women's activities in achieving peace and stability in the Arab world. In particular, those organizations support the role of women in launching effective political negotiations aimed at reaching settlements to ongoing international political issues.  The Government of Egypt is also making great efforts to strengthen the status of women in all fields, especially in such vital areas as peacekeeping and peacebuilding in post-conflict situations, which require particular attention and follow-up. Egypt will continue to play its role in national, regional and international efforts to strengthen the status of women, in coordination with the main bodies responsible for women's issues within the Organization.

    " Allow me to begin by thanking the United States presidency for having organized this open debate, which clearly reflects the Security Council's commitment to full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and, in particular, the growing concern regarding the use of various forms of sexual violence against the civilian population, particularly women and girls, in conflict and post-conflict situations.  In the framework of a human rights perspective, Argentina places high priority on the situation of women and girls in conflict situations, and on the participation of women as key protagonists in peace processes and in peacebuilding.  Resolution 1325 (2000) provides a legal framework which allows for the effective participation of women at the national and international levels, within the broader and indispensable legal framework comprising the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the outcome documents of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, on women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century (General Assembly resolutions S-23\/2 and S-23\/3), as well as other relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly, specifically Assembly resolutions 58\/185, on the in-depth study on all forms of violence against women, and 62\/134 on eliminating rape and other forms of sexual Violence in all their manifestations, including in conflict and related situations. As a reflection of this deep commitment, Argentina is one of four countries carrying out the pilot programme for the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and has started to take concrete actions, including the first regional workshop for the development of a gender policy for peace operations, held in our country in May with a View to strengthening alliances at all levels to move forward on gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping operations.  In this regard, we would like to note that Argentina has fully incorporated United Nations recommendations on gender in all aspects of its participation in peacekeeping operations. The Argentine Joint Peacekeeping Operations Training Centre has also incorporated a gender perspective in its doctrine, both at the administrative level and in the curricula of its training programmes.  As of January 2008, 26 Argentine women were participating in peacekeeping missions, particularly the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti and United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus. In 2007, 36 per cent of our participants in White Helmet humanitarian missions were women, a figure which is expected to reach 43 per cent in 2008.  Increasing numbers of reports from the field alert us on the use of sexual violence as a political or military tool in some current conflicts. A regrettable chapter of our past has shown us that rape and other heinous forms of sexual violence can be used by agents of the State as a tool to spread terror, and to torture and degrade those whom it considers their \"enemies\".  Sexual violence as a method of warfare is categorically prohibited. The widespread and systematic use of sexual violence is a grave violation of international law, particularly in the light of the Rome Statue of the International Criminal Court and by the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols.  Considering these realities, Argentina is persuaded of the need urgently to adopt effective measures to prevent and respond to such acts of sexual violence against civilian populations, which will significantly contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security. Such measures should include, inter alia, the protection of civilians, in particular women and girl children; the training of military and security personnel; the adoption and  08-3908] effective enforcement of appropriate legislation; and community-based work and care for the victims.  In order to ensure that effective measures are adopted, we consider that a report of the Secretary- General would be particularly useful. It should organize and analyse the information available to the United Nations system, with a specific focus on the shocking phenomenon of sexual violence as a political and military tool.  Lastly, Argentina is of the view that any effective response to this question must be two-pronged: promotion of full respect for the human rights of victims and an end to impunity for perpetrators. In this regard, we believe that the draft resolution before the Council today would have benefited from a strengthened legal framework, particularly with a firm reaffirmation of the Rome Statue of the International Criminal Court, the main tool available to the international community today to ensure that nobody can with impunity commit heinous crimes, such as those which we are considering today.  ",
    " We are grateful to Ms. Rachel Mayanja, Ms. Ines Alberdi, Ms. Sarah Taylor and Mr. Alain Le Roy for the very useful information that they provided, and we thank the Secretary-General for the preparation of his thematic report (S\/2008\/622).  Resolution 1325 (2000) remains our most important guideline in enhancing the role of women in conflict prevention and settlement, post-conflict rehabilitation and the protection of women's rights during conflicts. We must implement the resolution's provisions by creating equal opportunities for women to participate actively in all peacekeeping and security efforts and in enhancing their role in decision-making. To that end, we must ensure genuine overall gender equality. Therefore, efforts in that area should be undertaken not only by the Security Council, but also by other relevant United Nations organs, including the General Assembly, the Peacebuilding Commission, the Human Rights Council and the Commission on the Status of Women.  Women can make an even greater contribution to conflict prevention and settlement in all their aspects. In post-conflict rehabilitation, we must make broader use of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women as a fundamental document. We must also devote greater attention to gender mainstreaming in United Nations efforts to reduce poverty and address inequality as sources of conflict. Here, we could refer to, inter alia, increased participation by women in decision-making on social and economic issues and in establishing national frameworks for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  We welcome the concrete steps taken by the United Nations system to guarantee the exercise of women's rights. We believe that there is a need to make more active use of the expertise of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women. At the same time, we note that the Secretary-General's report does not provide a comprehensive response to the Council's earlier question regarding the impact of armed conflict on women and girls in situations on the Council's agenda. Only one page is devoted to that very important topic, and a whole set of serious issues is simply overlooked. Another issue, the protection of women in armed conflict, is virtually reduced to the problem of sexual violence, while other crimes against women are ignored. Such an approach significantly reduces the tasks mandated by resolution 1325 (2000). From the perspective of the Security Council's Charter objectives, it should focus first and foremost on the most pressing, large-scale armed conflicts.  The United Nations should, as a priority, respond to systematic mass violence against women and children. Equal attention should be given to all categories of such violence in conflicts. Of serious concern are cases in which women and children are killed or injured, including as a result of the indiscriminate or excessive use of force. Unfortunately, recent examples of that can be found in many parts of the world. Such crimes often go unpunished or are justified by citing the unavoidable nature of so-called collateral damage. We believe that the Council should assess such cases in an unbiased and principled manner.  It is important that gender mainstreaming in United Nations work, including in the field, yield concrete results in the protection and advancement of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict societies. That requires balanced system-wide approaches that provide, first and foremost, for the full participation of women themselves in those processes.  ",
    " First of all, I would like to thank Ambassador Khalilzad and the Security Council for inviting us here today and for taking the time to reflect on sexual violence in conflict and post- conflict situations.  My name is Patrick Cammaert. I retired last year as a major general after 39 years of service. My last job was general officer in command of the eastern division of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC). I spent a large part of my military career operating in conflict zones, including the years I served with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO),  I have witnessed that violence directed at women and girls can be a particularly potent tool of war. Armed groups persecute communities by dehumanizing women and girls, which is considered to be an attack against the values or honour of a society. Even when a war is formally over and a United Nations peacekeeping force is deployed, women and girls remain targets for violence.  The current climate of impunity in most of the post-conflict contexts allows the many forms of gender-based violence, including sexual violence, to flourish. Often the political will to end the vicious cycle of impunity does not exist. Impunity thus remains an important impediment to the prevention of sexual violence.  It has probably become more dangerous to be a woman than a soldier in an armed conflict. Testimonies of survivors of sexual violence reveal shocking brutality. Many of them suffer from grave long-term psychological and physical health consequences, including traumatic fistula and HIV. They remain disabled for life.  Survivors of sexual violence face enormous barriers in securing justice through the courts or through more informal, community-based mechanisms. Given the lack of adequate and responsive law enforcement, women in particular are reluctant to seek justice and to file complaints against attackers. Survivors usually prefer to suffer in silence, fearing stigma or ostracism. Today, several armed groups continue to use sexual violence as a weapon of war in Africa in various forms, including sexual slavery, kidnapping, forced prostitution and rape. The scale and brutality of the sexual violence faced by women and girls in armed conflicts amounts to war crimes and crimes against humanity.  Sexual violence must be perceived as a threat to peace and security in the entire world, and in Africa in particular.  The Security Council has an important role to play in fighting sexual violence against women and girls. The United Nations and the international community need to continue their campaigns to intensify actions to end violence against women and girls. Peacekeepers can play an important role in  preventing and addressing sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict zones.  It is important that the Council continue to provide modern and multidimensional United Nations peacekeeping missions with a mandate to protect civilians under imminent threat of physical violence. Visible United Nations military presence on the ground proved to be effective in preventing sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Darfur.  To be effective in the protection of civilians, a United Nations peacekeeping force must have a clear mandate, strong rules of engagement, sufficient robust armament and well-trained and well-equipped troops. However, equally important is the willingness of United Nations commanders to take swift decisions when the presence of armed groups is reported.  The deployment of female military and police personnel has proven to be effective. A critical mass of women in peacekeeping missions can enhance confidence-building with the host community by presenting an organization that looks more like a civilian society than a military occupation force. Local women who already live in fear of men due to repeated sexual violence, often perpetrated by men in uniform, may feel more confident talking to other women.  You seated around this table are the United Nations, and you play an important role in ensuring that the United Nations and the international community continue to intensify actions to end violence against women and girls. We understand how many issues are before you at this moment, each needing great care and attention. However, woman and girls around the world are suffering. You have the responsibility to protect them and to take real and effective measures to put an end to this.  ",
    " The Philippines would like to begin by congratulating the United States and commending it for having convened this debate on the important issue of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict. We thank you, Mr. President, for giving the Philippines the opportunity to address the Council on this issue.  The Philippines joins previous speakers in condemning acts of sexual violence inflicted on women and girls by parties involved in armed conflict. Sexual violence in situations of armed conflict is something to which the international community should not close its eyes. As we speak, reports on how women and girls have found themselves victims of sexual violence and on how they remain vulnerable to increased risk of violence from parties involved in armed conflicts continue to stream in from various hotspots around the world.  The sexual abuse committed against women and girls is deeply rooted in a pervasive culture of discrimination, highlighted by the unequal power equation which denies females equal status. This inequality is manifested in a number of ways during conflict, particularly through the social, political and cultural norms that identify women and girls not only as the property of men, but also as sexual objects. This inequality also finds form as a tool of war, with violence directed at women being considered an attack against the values and honour of a society.  While it is easy to see the vulnerabilities of women, there is a tendency to regard them only as victims of violence, most especially sexual violence. Unfortunately, this obscures the many positive roles that women play in conflict situations, especially as agents of peace and reconciliation, as called for under Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security.  The Philippines continues to regard resolution 1325 (2000) as an important contribution by the Security Council to addressing the complex issues affecting women in countries torn by conflict. Resolution 1325 (2000) is an instrument that brings a United Nations gender perspective to conflict analysis, monitoring and resolution. This has had a great impact on the transformative responses that are needed to address the gender dimension of conflict.  The fundamental strategy of the Philippines in pursuing the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) lies in enabling more women to systematically participate in conflict prevention, management and resolution and in post-conflict peacebuilding, while at the same time rehabilitating their communities and ensuring basic services and livelihoods. Women are empowered to take part in local peace processes by building capacities and mobilizing peace constituencies. Women in indigenous communities, for instance, are even serving as intermediaries in local peace dialogues and as mediators in the restoration of broken peace pacts. The roles that women play in addressing the issues surrounding them are critical; therefore, the Philippines remains convinced that women must be utilized as active agents in confronting gender-based violence. The response to sexual exploitation in conflict situations necessitates a comprehensive approach. As this entails a response which should address the various dimensions of the problem, the United Nations must mobilize the entities within its system and build on their comparative advantages to address the root causes, manifestations and consequences of conflict.  The Philippines recognizes the role of the Security Council in addressing conflict in its various dimensions, including the gender dimension, to the extent that this is in accordance with the Council's mandate. It should be emphasized that, since the issue of sexual violence requires a more holistic response, including political, economic, social and cultural aspects, the Security Council's actions, which comprise only part of the response, must be coherently coordinated with the efforts of other bodies, such as the development-oriented agencies.  The Philippines also wishes to underscore the importance of the regional context in assessing and addressing conflict, as well as in coming up with the appropriate responses to the gender dimensions of conflicts. In this connection, the Philippines urges the Security Council to work closely with the relevant regional intergovernmental and civil society organizations in areas of conflict.  While the Philippines recognizes the need to urgently confront sexual violence in conflict, it believes that the Security Council must also exercise caution to ensure that it does not confront the conflict situation narrowly by focusing on palliatives to address the issue of gender violence. As sexual violence is part of the bigger context of conflict, the Security Council must see to it that it also uses its mandate mainly to assess and address this broader picture. Bearing in mind the need to evaluate the effectiveness of targeted measures and sanctions, the Security Council must be cognizant that these, if contemplated, must not exacerbate the conflict or give rise to negative consequences for the civilian population.  The Security Council can concretely contribute to gender-sensitive conflict prevention and resolution, including post-conflict reconstruction and peacebuilding, by taking the necessary steps to put an end to impunity by going after all violators without exception. This could also be accomplished by integrating gender issues in the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process, incorporating  08-3908] the necessary gender training in the security sector and facilitating the establishment of necessary infrastructure and capacity for women's access to justice, as well as cooperative work with non-governmental organizations and other community groups.  To further address the issue of sexual violence, the Security Council could support systems for gender- sensitive monitoring of conflicts, including the collection of sex-disaggregated data and information with the engagement of national and local authorities. This is important to facilitate national ownership and accountability. The Security Council could also advocate for the inclusion of gender violence issues in peace accords and peace processes between parties to conflict.  The Philippines believes that the Security Council can help address the issue of gender violence in conflict areas by seeing to it that the design and training of peacekeeping missions include the deployment of more female police and military personnel, the necessary gender-sensitivity training by troop-contributing countries and the enforcement of a zero-tolerance policy towards sexual exploitation and abuse involving peacekeepers.  In the case of the Philippines, gender sensitivity is incorporated in the predeployment training for personnel of our armed forces and our national police whom we send out to support United Nations peacekeeping operations. As early as four years ago, the Philippines had put in place a zero-tolerance policy on misconduct, especially on sexual exploitation and abuse that could be committed by our peacekeepers. This policy of zero tolerance, which is firmly embedded in the revised policy framework and guidelines governing Philippine participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations, serves as a guarantee that no Filipino peacekeeper will go unpunished for misdeeds committed in mission areas.  Finally, the Philippines, as one of the largest contributors, if not the largest contributor, of individual police officers to United Nations peacekeeping operations, could also support calls for the deployment of more female police officers, especially those experienced in handling gender violence cases. We hope that such a contribution would help to bring about better monitoring, reporting and response to cases of gender violence in conflict areas. ",
    " Mr. President, allow me to congratulate you for organizing this open debate on women and peace and security. By focusing our discussion on sexual violence in situations of armed conflict, the Security Council will be sending an authoritative message of condemnation to those parties that are perpetrating or condoning such acts in conflict situations as well as a message of hope to the victims. This debate is also contributing to defining an international code against sexual violence in conflict situations.  I thank the President of the General Assembly, the Deputy Secretary-General and all the presenters for their informative presentations on this subject earlier today.  The concern for the protection of women and girls against sexual and gender-based Violence has been reflected in various Security Council documents. It is unfortunate that, despite the numerous calls made to protect women and girls, there has been an escalation of systematic and brutal acts of sexual violence and abuses as calculated instruments of war against civilians, especially women and girls. The Security Council, with the support of Member States, needs to take bold measures to stop this trend. It is our expectation, therefore, that this open debate will lead to recommendations that will enable the Security Council to respond effectively to the use of sexual and gender-based violence in conflict situations and to galvanize concerted international action against such crimes.  It is high time that we recognized sexual violence in conflict situations as a pervasive criminal act with global repercussions. Such acts of targeted violence add new dimensions to regional and international peace and security. We call upon all parties to conflict to end these barbarous acts and to take measures to protect civilians, including women and girls.  The Security Council needs to send a clear message to parties in armed conflicts that sexual violence in any manifestation is not condoned and that stern measures will be taken against the perpetrators so as to end impunity. We thus call upon Member States to comply with their obligations to prosecute perpetrators and to support the work of the International Criminal Court in that regard.  It is unfortunate that civilians, and in particular women and girls, are increasingly being targeted in current warfare. Humanitarian law is being blatantly violated and perpetrators escape with impunity. There  08-3908] is thus an enormous challenge to the international community as a whole and to peacekeeping missions in particular to ensure that civilians are protected.  We are encouraged that sexual violence is included in some peacekeeping protection of civilian mandates. These mandates, however, need to be matched with political resolve and resources, doctrine and guidance. In the same vein, the national defence policies of troop-contributing countries need to be explicit and emphatic on protection of civilians, including women and girls, in the training of troops for peacekeeping missions. Equally, national laws must be robust in dealing with those responsible for such acts of violence.  Sexual violence in conflict situations needs to be addressed holistically. In that regard, efforts to encourage women to report it when they are attacked, as well as mechanisms to assist the victims, need to be in place. In addition, programmes to strengthen the rule of law need to be implemented so as to end impunity and provide justice for the victims. In the longer term, community-based interventions to address the health, psychosocial and educational needs of children and adults, including men and boys, affected by and implicated in the violence need also to be in place. This means that interventions need to be carried out during and after a conflict.  While we believe that national Governments have the primary responsibility for the protection of their nationals, the support of the international community, as appropriate, is critical in addressing sexual violence in conflict situations.  Let me conclude by reiterating that the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania strongly condemns all acts of sexual and gender-based Violence in all their manifestations. It is in this regard that Tanzania joined in sponsoring last year's General Assembly resolution 62\/ 134, entitled \"Eliminating rape and other forms of sexual violence in all their manifestations, including in conflict and related situations\", and is among the sponsors of the draft resolution to be adopted today. We are willing to work with the international community to end sexual and gender-based violence as well as to end impunity.  ",
    " I thank you, Mr. President, for having taken the initiative to convene this public debate on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, and on the issue of promoting women's participation in peace processes. I also thank Ms. Rachel Mayanja, Ms. Ines Alberdi, Ms. Sarah Taylor and Mr. Alain Le Roy for their introductory briefings.  Belgium aligns itself with the statement made earlier by the representative of France on behalf of the European Union.  Before turning to the specific issue of the participation of women in peace processes, I wish to  voice the View that, eight years after the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), we should ask ourselves - as Ms. Taylor has asked - about our implementation of that resolution. Despite the efforts of the United Nations system, described in the report of the Secretary-General (S\/2008\/622), and the efforts we have all made, the resolution's objectives have not been attained. The situation of women in conflict and post-conflict zones remains worrisome - indeed, tragic. The implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) in its entirety is the duty of all Member States, and their role and responsibility are vital.  By the end of this year, Belgium will present its action plan on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). The preparation of the action plan, in consultation with civil society, has been an enriching experience for all the Belgian political and administrative entities involved. The drafting of the plan has revealed a series of challenges both internally and with respect to our multilateral activities. For example, we have seen that the gender dimension must be mainstreamed in our fight to achieve a ban on the use of anti-personnel landmines and cluster bombs, whose primary victims are women and children.  At the internal level we have seen that good gender-equality legislation alone has not been sufficient. Even though they may reflect firm political will, legislative texts must be combined with investment in know-how in the sphere of gender issues if they are to be implemented effectively.  We all agree that we need a better balance - parity - between women and men in international organizations, especially in the highest positions. To achieve that, more women must show their readiness to accept such high-level posts. In this, they must be encouraged and, above all, supported. As part of its policy on applications for international posts, Belgium actively encourages women candidates.  You were entirely right, Mr. President, to place the issue of the participation of women in peace processes at the heart of our debate. Resolution 1325 (2000) recognizes and stresses the need to involve women in all aspects and phases of the transition in countries emerging from conflict, as well as in the peace process itself, in restoring the rule of law and in rebuilding economic systems.  One cannot restore lasting peace without the involvement of women. Ms. Mayanja pointed that out eloquently. We must involve women to a much greater extent in specific issues that arise at the end of a conflict. It is important that women are able not simply to state their needs, including with regard to justice and reconstruction; they must also be able to participate genuinely in the decision-making process.  Peacekeeping missions have the responsibility to ensure that the place of women in peace processes is assured. From the outset of a mission, the community of women at the local level, on the ground, and, where they exist, women leaders must be encouraged and invited to defend and present their opinions and to participate in public decisions. The Security Council has an important role to play in that respect. Under- Secretary-General Le Roy also indicated that in his briefing.  Allow me to conclude by recalling resolution 1820 (2008), which deals with the problem of sexual violence in armed conflicts. In its condemnation of the use of all forms of violence and sexual violence against civilians, that resolution, as Ms. Alberdi said, is an essential complement to resolution 1325 (2000). The scourge of sexual violence must be eliminated without delay. For Belgium, that remains the priority in our overall implementation of the resolution on women, peace and security.  ",
    " New Zealand welcomes this opportunity to focus on women and peace and security, and once again reaffirms its strong support for resolution 1325 (2000). New Zealand is committed to seeking ways to enhance and strengthen the implementation of the resolution through our development cooperation programmes, peacekeeping efforts and domestic policies.  Resolution 1325 (2000) remains the internationally accepted blueprint for a multifaceted response to the issues facing women in conflict and post-conflict reconstruction. It has played an invaluable part in highlighting the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts.  New Zealand welcomes increased Security Council attention to the reality of sexual violence during conflict and to the need to end impunity for crimes, including sexual violence. Sadly, sexual violence continues unabated in conflict and post- conflict situations around the world. It is a gross violation of women's human rights, which further exacerbates the vulnerability of women and girls in times of conflict. Sexual violence is an attack not only on the dignity of women but also on the peace process: it raises significant barriers to reconciliation and peace. New Zealand attaches great importance to the need to eliminate such violence.  We welcome the advances that have been made in these areas by the United Nations and Member States. We strongly endorse the Secretary-General's forthcoming report on all forms of violence against women. New Zealand has actively supported General Assembly resolutions on the intensification of efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women and on eliminating rape and other forms of sexual violence in all their manifestations, including in conflict and related situations.  New Zealand's response to resolution 1325 (2000) is proactive and includes a number of specific steps to encourage implementation both domestically and internationally. Here are four examples of that.  First, New Zealand is committed to encouraging women to undertake assignments on peacekeeping missions. Women from the New Zealand Defence Force, New Zealand Police and our wider society are an integral part of New Zealand's regional, United Nations and other international peacekeeping efforts. This includes women working in high-risk areas, such as Afghanistan, and on operational missions, such as in Timor-Leste. Furthermore, up to 30 per cent of all of our police peacekeeping deployments are female - among the highest rate in the world.  Secondly, the New Zealand Defence Force has worked hard to integrate women at all levels and in all trades of the Force, including combat. Its diversity strategy recognizes the full value of integrating women into the Defence Force and the benefits of having women at more senior levels.  Thirdly, New Zealand attaches priority to promoting women's rights through the delivery of official development assistance. Gender-based violence is a core focus area for New Zealand's International Aid and Development Agency (NZAID). NZAID supports a number of initiatives in the Pacific region aimed at empowering women and mitigating their exposure to violence. For example, New Zealand is currently involved in the Pacific Prevention of Domestic Violence Programme, a joint initiative of NZAID, the New Zealand Police and the Pacific Islands Chiefs of Police organization. It seeks to tackle domestic Violence and influence social change.  Fourthly, the NZAID conflict and peacebuilding policy identifies women and girls in conflict and post- conflict areas as a priority group for attention and specifically includes the need to provide support for the full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). It highlights the gender impact of conflict and the role of women in peacebuilding. In conclusion, New Zealand commends you, Mr. President, for the opportunity for this debate on resolution 1325 (2000), but we agree that progress towards achieving its major goals has been slow and uneven. There remains an urgent need to increase political commitment and resources to ensure its systematic implementation.  ",
    " First of all, allow me to fully align myself with the statement that will be delivered by Slovenia in its capacity as President of the European Union.  The issues that we are addressing today - women and peace and security - deserve the international community's utmost attention and unequivocal support. I will therefore begin by stressing Italy's commitment to the full implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), which provides a comprehensive framework for addressing every aspect of the relationship between women and peace and security. It recognizes a key concept that should guide all of our actions in this field: women cannot be protected unless their participation at the decision-making level in all peace and reconciliation processes is ensured. At the same time, the protection of women from the violence of war is a necessary step towards empowering them to participate in the rebuilding of their societies.  Our success in implementing resolution 1325 (2000) must be judged on the basis of the improvements that we have already secured relating to the status of women. In our opinion, only one conclusion can be drawn: not enough has been done. Hence our conviction that the time has come to identify achievable and specific goals, without losing sight of the general picture.  From this perspective, countering the unspeakable horrors resulting from the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war is a clear priority. I am therefore particularly grateful to the Government of the United States of America and to you, Madam President, for having organized today's open debate and for having submitted the draft resolution that will be adopted later and that Italy is honoured to co-sponsor.  The situation before us is appalling: 70 per cent of the casualties in recent conflicts have been civilians or non-combatants - most of them women and children. Women's bodies have been increasingly targeted during conflicts. Evidence shows that in many cases this represents a deliberate method of warfare and, sadly, a particularly devastating one. Rape and sexual violence are used to achieve political and military aims; to dominate, terrify and humiliate opponents; and to uproot communities and ethnic groups, thus contributing to the collapse of entire societies for generations to come.  Concrete information and precise evidence is, unfortunately, hard to come by, since the victims are often unreasonably and unacceptably stigmatized and too traumatized to come forward and denounce the violence to which they have been subjected. Nevertheless, what we do know is truly appalling: millions of women and girls have been raped, gang- raped, sexually tortured and abused, often in particularly atrocious ways.  From that perspective, the link between sexual violence and the maintenance of peace and security becomes evident; it demands immediate action by the international community and is therefore very much the business of the Council. All mandates for United Nations missions should ensure that whenever and wherever the United Nations is in the field - be it in peacekeeping or humanitarian operations - its staff is trained to prevent, recognize and respond to sexual violence. A collection and analysis of existing best practices could be an important exercise, leading, hopefully, to the formulation of a United Nations doctrine that sets training standards for all military and police personnel deployed by the Organization. The Council's demand in today's draft resolution is clear: all parties to armed conflict must immediately cease all acts of sexual violence and take special measures to protect women and girls. The Council will have to follow up its demands by monitoring the parties' implementation of those obligations. Accountability is a key element. We have to identify the parties that continue to use sexual violence as a tactic of war, and we must build on the example set by resolution 1807 (2008).  We therefore need an efficient system to gather accurate information. We hope that the report requested in the draft resolution will meet this need. We also need to fight impunity for such acts, defined as a crime against humanity and a war crime by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. We must devote more time and resources to strengthening the activities of national and international tribunals, including in post-conflict situations, to building a gender-sensitive transitional justice system and a gender-sensitive security sector.  In this regard, I am very pleased to announce that Italy is in the process of disbursing a specific contribution of \u00e2\u201a\u00acl million to fund a United Nations Development Fund for Women programme on resolution 1325 (2000) in Liberia, in addition to several other initiatives that it has financed in recent years.  Today's resolution will be a major step forward, much like resolution 1325 (2000) was eight years ago. The Security Council has the moral and legal responsibility to send a clear message to the international community that it is determined to put an end to this scourge; to the perpetrators of crimes against women that they will no longer go unpunished; and to women that they will no longer be the victims of armed conflict, but rather the main agents of life and peace in their societies.  ",
    " I join those who have congratulated you, Mr. President, on assuming the presidency of this Council. I note that New Zealand seeks the protection of women and their equal participation in peace processes. We thank you for having arranged this debate and we appreciate the opportunity to contribute.  This is the third consecutive month the Security Council has debated the issues of women, peace and security. We welcome that increased focus, in particular the attention given to the scourge of sexual violence. We commend the Council's readiness to address those issues more systematically. Only last week, New Zealand joined in co-sponsoring resolution 1888 (2009) in this Council. Along with resolutions 1325 (2000), 1820 (2008), 1882 (2009), 1888 (2009) and the resolution that was adopted today, 1889 (2009), we have come a long way in developing a comprehensive set of norms to protect and enhance the participation of women and girls in peace processes.  Today, we lend a strong voice to calls urging States, regional groups and the United Nations system to translate those words into action. To do this, we recognize the need for stronger leadership and coordination across the United Nations system. We welcome two recent initiatives that should contribute to this goal. First is the future appointment of a Special Representative of the Secretary-General on sexual violence in armed conflict. And the second is the General Assembly's recent action to reform the United Nations gender architecture. We now urge the Secretary-General to appoint strong and dynamic advocates of the resolution 1325 (2000) agenda to the role of the new Special Representative and as head of the new composite gender entity.  As we focus more on sexual violence, we must also redouble our efforts to implement the other crucial aspects of resolution 1325 (2000) - increased participation of women both in peacekeeping and peacebuilding missions and in mediation and negotiation processes. To make a lasting impact on the lives of women in conflict and post-conflict situations, 5 we must adopt an integrated approach to each of the pillars of resolution 1325 (2000). To this end, the appointment of a Special Representative should provide much needed visibility, leadership and coherence. For this reason we believe the mandate of the Special Representative should cover all aspects of the women, peace and security agenda, not just the issue of sexual violence.  New Zealand acknowledges that States must also take responsibility for making progress towards the goals of resolution 1325 (2000), including enabling the full participation of women and girls in the peace process. Among other things, women need access to shelter, health care, a livelihood, education and justice. They should be part of any decision-making processes. And, above all, they must be free from violence.  New Zealand is committed to addressing these needs as part of its own peacekeeping efforts. There are several concrete examples of how we do this through our provincial reconstruction team in Bamiyan Province in Afghanistan. To facilitate the participation of women in Afghanistan's national police force, New Zealand police have helped ensure that on-site childcare services are available for women students, that women instructors are available for training, and that mentoring is provided to instructors and senior male staff in the Afghan National Police to support the training of women. Through the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, New Zealand supports the Women's Protection Network in Bamiyan. We have contributed funding to establish a Women's Referral Centre in Bamiyan to provide secure accommodation and paralegal advice for women seeking access to justice. New Zealand's provincial reconstruction team also supports the local Ministry of Women's Affairs in developing a gender network to look at ways to empower local women and build capacity for women's affairs in the region. Finally, our networking activities include disseminating information to women to help them solve their own problems, holding training workshops around the province and promoting discussion groups on issues such as the role of mothers in the home.  Nine years on from the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), much remains to be done. This Council has my assurance that New Zealand, through its development cooperation programmes, its peacekeeping efforts and its domestic policies, will continue to seek ways to enhance and ensure the 6 protection and equal participation, of women in peace processes. Resolution 1325 (2000) has our ongoing, full and determined support.  ",
    " I would first like to thank you, Sir, and the United Kingdom presidency for organizing this debate. I would also like to welcome the Secretary-General. Austria applauds him for his unwavering commitment in the fight against all forms of violence against women.  The adoption of resolution 1820 (2008) a year ago was an historical event. The resolution clearly states that sexual violence against women in armed conflict can constitute a threat to international peace and security that requires the attention of the Security Council. Despite positive and successful steps undertaken by the United Nations and individual States, women continue to fall victim to sexual violence used as a deliberate means of warfare. This takes place on a daily basis in conflict situations around the world.  Austria aligns itself with the statement to be delivered by the representative of Sweden on behalf of the European Union, as well as with that to be made by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Human Security Network. I would like to concentrate on a number of practical proposals on how the Council could further improve its action on this important matter.  Systematic attention needs to be paid to the prevention of and protection from sexual violence in the daily deliberations of the Council. We welcome the recent adoption of resolution 1882 (2009), extending the scope of the monitoring and reporting mechanism to parties who perpetrate grave sexual violence against children in situations of armed conflict. As women and girls represent the majority of victims of sexual violence, there is a need to ensure that reporting is not strictly limited to victims under the age of 18. In this context, we would welcome further information in a follow-up report next year on an appropriate monitoring and accountability mechanism to be established by the Council.  Austria also welcomes the work of the Council's informal Expert Group on the Protection of Civilians, which we see as a useful forum for discussing important protection concerns, including those in the fight against sexual violence.  More consistent and comprehensive reporting on sexual violence in the Secretary-General's country- specific reports would enable the Council to address the protection of civilians, particularly women and children, from sexual violence in a more systematic manner. To this end, the Council should include specific reporting requirements in resolutions establishing or renewing mandates.  Briefings by the Secretary-General's special representatives, the Emergency Relief Coordinator, the High Commissioner for Human Rights and relevant rapporteurs will and can also provide the Council with information crucial to its work.  We are fully aware of the sensitivities of collecting data from victims of sexual violence, who are often severely traumatized by the dramatic experiences they have gone through. Guidelines on information gathering must take ethical and safety concerns into account. Short- and long-term assistance for survivors of sexual violence, in particular accessible and quality health care, psychosocial support and legal advice should be a priority.  Let me also acknowledge the vital role that non-governmental organizations and humanitarian organizations play in this regard. Access constraints for humanitarian actors can severely affect the situation of victims of sexual violence.  Today, a clear body of rules outlawing sexual violence, including in armed conflict, is contained in international human rights, humanitarian and international criminal law. In spite of this, perpetrators who systematically commit serious violations against women and girls still go largely unpunishcd. Allegations of sexual violence need to be thoroughly investigated and perpetrators need to be brought to account, including not only through prosecution, but also through the vetting of armed and security forces. This situation demands further action by the Security Council to strengthen the rule of law and to  end impunity. Where necessary, the Council should consider appropriate measures encouraging and ensuring accountability for those responsible for international crimes, including through the establishment of commissions of inquiry, referrals to the International Criminal Court and the imposition of targeted measures. Sanctions committees need to receive relevant information to this end, including through exchanges with other subsidiary bodies.  The Council took an important step when deciding to give priority to the protection of civilians in the mandate of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC). This led to the subsequent adoption of the Comprehensive Strategy on Combating Sexual Violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, endorsed by the Government.  It is also a very important and positive development that the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has now finally decided to take concrete measures in the five particularly dramatic cases to which the Council once again drew the attention of that country's authorities during its mission there. It is evidently necessary that the Council continue to follow up on this matter.  We are encouraged by the valuable work of MONUC's new joint protection teams. We must draw on lessons learned by such best practices in order to transpose them to the contexts of other missions. That is certainly an issue with which we will have to deal when we consider, in general terms, the subject of the protection of civilians in peacekeeping.  The active contribution of women to peacebuilding and conflict prevention is crucial to achieving lasting peace. Resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) have underlined the need to include women in peacekeeping and peacebuilding measures. Further efforts are needed. The development of gender guidelines for military personnel by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the development of guidelines for mediators and their consistent implementation can contribute to improving our response to sexual violence in conflict settings.  In order to effectively fight sexual violence, improved coordination throughout the system, as well as leadership and accountability, are needed. Austria fully supports the appointment of a senior person with responsibility to attend to the prevention of and  response to sexual violence across the entire United Nations system.  Austria is grateful for the Secretary-General's willingness to provide the Council with annual reports on this very important matter, and we look forward to receiving them in the interest of enhancing the implementation of resolution 1820 (2008).  ",
    " Mr. President, we thank you for organizing this important Security Council debate on the implementation of resolution 1820 (2008), on sexual violence against women, during the presidency of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. We commend the Secretary- General's report on this matter (S\/2009\/362), which advances our understanding of the subject of sexual violence against women, especially in situations of armed conflict and post-armed conflict situations, and the measures which need to be taken to preventing and address violence against girls and women.  We appreciate and encourage the leadership of the Secretary-General and the Security Council on this subject, which needs to be linked normatively and operationally to resolution 1325 (2000), on women and armed conflict. Both resolutions are central to international peace and security. They have generated significant positive responses from States and regional and international organizations, which have become engaged in addressing gender-based violence in conflict and non-conflict situations alike.  In Tanzania, we are working with the United Nations system - especially the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) - on advocacy initiatives, as well as promoting legislative and policy measures to address and mainstream national initiatives against gender-based violence. Tanzania has agreed with UNIFEM. to lead a regional initiative related to the campaign against gender-based  violence, including sexual violence against girls and women.  I also take this opportunity to draw the attention of the Council and the United Nations system to the newly launched African Union gender policy, which is related to, among other issues, the implementation of Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008). We encourage the Council and the United Nations system as a whole to cooperate and coordinate with the African Union on initiatives in these areas, as appropriate. This could be a subject of future discussions in the evolving partnership and cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union.  There are many challenges in the implementation of resolution 1820 (2008) at all levels. Among those that stand out and require urgent responses at all levels is the collection of adequate and reliable information on sexual violence. That can best be done through the provision of assured access to humanitarian assistance for survivors of Violence. Information would not only give us a better understanding of the problem, but also allow us to devise appropriate strategies to address the problem and help the victims of sexual violence. In peacekeeping missions and other humanitarian operations, access to survivors of sexual violence must be given due priority.  Coordinated action within the United Nations through a focal point in the Secretariat needs to be part of the wider initiative of the gender entity in the United Nations system-wide coherence exercise. This ought to go hand in hand with developing expertise on gender- based violence within United Nations agencies in the humanitarian sector. We commend the individual agencies, funds and programmes that already have dedicated units to deal with gender-based violence, but their mandates would be greatly enhanced through a system-wide focal point.  While the Security Council, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs continue to improve the protection of civilians in peacekeeping missions, preventing and protecting against sexual violence remain a relatively new and still evolving undertaking. We therefore encourage troop- contributing countries, in partnership with DPKO, to develop specific training for peacekeepers in the protection of women and girls against sexual violence before their deployment to peacekeeping missions.  That would entail increasing the numbers of female military and police officers, as well as of trained civilian female staff, to be deployed in the field.  We look forward to participating in a wider debate in the Council later this year on the protection of civilians in peacekeeping operations.  ",
    " Let me begin, Mr. President, by welcoming you to this meeting of the Security Council. It is an honour to have you among us. We also recognize your delegation's leadership in forging this initiative in follow-up to resolution 1325 (2000). Our thanks go to the Secretary-General for his report on women and peace and security (S\/2009\/465), as well as to Deputy Secretary-General Migiro for her statement. My thanks go also to Ms. Rachel N. Mayanja, Ms. Ines Alberdi and Ms. Asha Hagi Elmi Amin.  We congratulate the delegation of the United States for its successful presidency of the Security Council in September, and we wish the Vietnamese delegation every success during its presidency this month.  Almost 10 years have passed since the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), and, while some progress has been made, the realities faced by women in conflict and post-conflict situations continue to be a matter of concern. Armed conflict continues to have a disproportionate impact on women and girls, and sexual violence continues to destroy the lives of thousands of them. We reiterate our appeal that in any conflict situation the parties recognize that it is essential under all circumstances to respect and ensure respect for the provisions of international humanitarian law.  Mexico is of the View that resolutions 1882 (2009) and 1888 (2009), which address sexual violence in armed conflict, constitute a positive step in strengthening applicable international law with respect to the protection of civilian populations in armed conflict, in particular the most vulnerable groups affected by sexual violence, including women and children.  The challenge now is to ensure full implementation on the ground, and resolution 1889 (2009), which we adopted this morning, is a very valuable contribution in that regard. We hope that the special representative of the Secretary-General on sexual violence in armed conflict and the team of experts - both called for in last week's resolution 1888 (2009) - will contribute to progress in this area.  We recognize the efforts being made by the United Nations Development Programme, the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women, the World Food Programme, the United Nations Development Fund for Women and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in promoting the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). We hope that the outcome of negotiations on the new gender entity will expedite progress, which has been slow thus far, on the implementation of that resolution.  Mexico reaffirms how important it is that the mandates of peacekeeping missions include measures to support Governments in formulating national action plans for the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  We can wait no longer for the international community to give due priority to the role of women as active protagonists, not solely as victims, in order to remedy their marginal participation in peace processes and mediation. We fully support the Secretary-General appeal for a strategy to increase the number of women in senior United Nations positions, in particular as special representatives, special envoys, high-level mediators and officials in peacekeeping and political missions.  We also view it as especially important to request of the Secretary-General a series of indicators in order to better and more effectively assess the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). We consider that this would be a valuable tool that will enable us to make progress next year, when we mark the tenth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000).  The lack of follow-up mechanisms for resolution 1325 (2000) has hampered the gathering of information about implementation on the ground. Mexico considers of particular importance the Secretary-General's call for assessment indicators to measure progress and shortcomings in the implementation of that resolution, and on that basis to take action to fill the gaps that have been identified. We also consider it appropriate to request the Secretary-General to include in all reports on conflict situations information on the impact on women and girls and their particular needs, as well as to identify the obstacles that stand in the way of meeting these needs.  Lastly, we would like to reiterate that our delegation truly believes that resolution 1889 (2009), adopted this morning, represents a significant step towards ensuring full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). We have now ensured that, by 2010, we will have the necessary tools to allow us to better understand the challenges and obstacles to be overcome and, above all, the measures we must take to guarantee the full participation of women in conflict prevention and in the building of lasting peace.

    " I thank you, Mr. President, for convening this open debate on the first report of the Secretary-General (S\/2009\/362) on the implementation of resolution 1820 (2008). I am also thankful to the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report and his highly focused briefing today.  More than a year ago, following the Security Council's open debate on widespread and systematic rape and other forms of sexual violence against women and girls in armed conflict, this Council adopted resolution 1820 (2008), leading to visibly improved awareness of sexual violence across the United Nations system, the international community and many conflict areas. Since then, sexual violence has been dealt with in many reports of the Secretary-General and outcome documents of the Security Council, as well as many other United Nations forums.  The adoption of resolution 1882 (2009) on children and armed conflict early this week, with criteria expanded to include in the annex lists of the Seeretary-General's reports parties that engage in patterns of killing, maiming and sexual violence against children, once again reaffirmed the Council's resolve to halt those violations.  Given the increasing sexual abuse and violence in many parts of the world, which we categorically condemn, Viet Nam supports efforts to fully translate into practice the 2007 United Nations Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict initiative and other measures aimed at preventing and responding to sexual violence in armed conflict in the areas of humanitarian assistance, awareness-raising, advocacy, capacity- building and training, legal, judicial and institutional reforms, and the provision of services to victims, and so on. We support the ongoing efforts of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the United Nations Development Fund for Women and other agencies to integrate sexual violence into protection of civilians mandates and to develop important materials, such as gender guidelines for military personnel in peacekeeping operations and the Analytical Inventory of Responses by Peacekeeping Personnel to War- Related Violence against Women.  Much remains to be done in the struggle against sexual violence in armed conflict. Greater efforts should be made to promote the empowerment of women and to improve women's participation in the early stages of peace processes, particularly in conflict resolution and peacebuilding. Along that line, we support a more proactive engagement of the United Nations in increasing women's participation in peace negotiations, as well as in political and peacekeeping missions, as an effective way to better support women and girl victims on the ground, while helping to foster women's empowerment in societies emerging from conflict. Measures to protect women and girls from sexual violence in conflict situations should be designed and implemented as part of a broader strategic framework that covers social, economic and development issues. As such, one of the best ways to prevent and respond to sexual violence is to further mainstream gender in  early recovery planning and financing at the national level. The United Nations, particularly the Peacebuilding Commission, the United Nations Development Programme and donors, should further assist national Governments in building gender-related capacity and developing gender-sensitive programmes to help survivors of sexual violence with a wide range of services - from access to justice, relief from stigma and ostracism, and provision of mental and psychological health care to support for greater physical, economic and social security through employment and income generation, and involvement in decision-making.  Underlining the high importance of international assistance and cooperation, we remain of the view that States bear the primary responsibility to protect their populations from all types of violations, including sexual violence. At the same time, my delegation believes that, in order to ensure the best possible cost- effective performance of the whole system, it is imperative to promote more efficient use and better coordination of existing mechanisms and structures, while giving initiatives on creating new ones serious and comprehensive consideration.  Finally, members may rest assured of Viet Nam's resolute determination to work constructively, together with all international partners, towards the strict implementation of all relevant international laws and Security Council resolutions, most directly resolution 1820 (2008), to put an end to sexual violence and to ensure a worthy place for women and girls in the life of humanity.  ",
    " I welcome the convening, on the initiative of the United States presidency of the Security Council, of this public debate on the issue of women and peace and security, focusing on the fight against sexual violence in armed conflict. The worldwide fight against this scourge is a priority.  Sadly, right now the topic is a timely one. During the events of 28 September in Conakry, Guinea, many people were killed and women were raped in the streets of the city. France would like to alert the Council to the tragic situation that is currently taking place in Conakry.  The worldwide fight against this scourge is a priority of France's foreign policy. We are delighted by the commitment of the United States on this issue, and I in this regard I hail the personal efforts of Hillary Clinton.  This new resolution marks a decisive step for the protection of women in armed conflict, nine years after the Council's adoption of the groundbreaking resolution 1325 (2000), and one year after the adoption of resolution 1820 (2008). It will strengthen the genuine implementation of those resolution thanks to its coherent set of provisions.  First of all, the appointment of a special representative of the Secretary-General to direct the fight against sexual violence in armed conflict is a major step forward, aiming to ensure the coherence of United Nations action with the support of United Nations Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict. We hope that this post will be created as soon as possible. We would like to see the appointment of a person with experience in the field and real knowledge of the issues of sexual violence. This person should also be in a position to be a voice for the voiceless - that is, the victims of these atrocities. We hope that the Secretary- General's report to identify possible improvements in the coherence of United Nations action, which will be put together over the next three months, will permit the new special representative to gain time when taking up the post.  Next, the creation of a team of experts charged with helping Governments in need will help bolster national authorities with high-level technical expertise available from within the United Nations or made available by nations that so desire. Within the sphere of peacekeeping operations, newly inaugurated women's protection advisers, whose mandate will be to monitor and follow-up on situations, will complement the actions of gender counselors. France will take a particular interest in ensuring the implementation of this measure. It is also essential that sexual violence be subject to specific follow-up in the reports on peacekeeping operations and the in annual report of the Secretary-General, including information on parties to armed conflict who commit sexual violence in situations that are on the Council's agenda, so as to provide more data and information, which for the moment remains too fragmentary.  I hope to have convinced everyone of the coherence of the set of provisions the Council has established with this new resolution, which include: the special representative; the Secretary-General's report to be completed within three months, to strengthen the effectiveness of the United Nations; the team of experts to better prevent and deal with sexual violence in States where it is necessary; strengthening the contribution of peacekeeping operations through the creation of the post of women's protection counselors; and annual reports by the Secretary-General so that the Council has adequate information, which is an essential prerequisite for its actions.  Allow me to highlight now France's commitment to two complementary elements in this plan: the mechanism for the protection of children in armed conflict; and the need for the Council to decide to impose sanctions where necessary to combat impunity. First of all, we must make use of the possibilities offered by the Council's Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict. This Group makes it possible to consider problematic situations, to make recommendations and, in case of persistent non-compliance with its recommendations by belligerents, to consider adopting sanctions by the Council. This is a unique mechanism whose effectiveness on the ground is real.  I welcome the very significant institutional progress made by the adoption last month of resolution 1882 (2009), which, inter alia, expanded the monitoring and reporting mechanism of resolution 1612 (2005) to include sexual violence committed against children, independent of the question of whether or not child soldiers are present. While this mechanism applies to children, it can nevertheless make a useful contribution to combating sexual violence against women. Just one figure allows us to grasp the relevance of such an approach: It is estimated that 60 per cent of the women raped in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are minors. In this respect, transparency, cooperation and coordination of efforts between the Special Representative of the Secretary- General for Children and Armed Conflict and the new special representative of the Secretary-General on sexual violence and armed conflict will be essential.  We must also accept the idea that without genuine punishment there can be neither prevention nor deterrence. Here, France welcomes the work done by the sanctions committees. Pursuant to the commitment made in resolution 1820 (2008) the Council must systematically consider the possibility of including sexual violence as grounds for sanctions when creating or reviewing the mandates of these committees. When the grounds exist, it is up to the experts to cite them. With this in mind, last March, together with Belgium, the United Kingdom and the United States, we supported the inclusion by the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo of four members of the Forces democratiques de liberation du Rwanda on the list of persons subject to individual sanctions.  Finally, France is pleased that the fight against sexual violence was subject to particular attention during the Security Council's annual visit to Africa in May. At that time the Security Council successfully advocated with the authorities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo for the prosecution of five officers accused of sexual violence. The Council must remain mobilized on this issue.  In conclusion I would like to recall that it is our responsibility to develop programmes to assist victims, to offer them care and prospects for rehabilitation and to work to avoid their stigmatization. Meeting their needs means that they must be systematically consulted and involved in all phases of the programmes designed for them. Members may be assured that France fully associates itself with and will join in the implementation of specific projects to assist victims of rape and other sexual violence.  ",
    " Mr. President, at the outset, allow me to welcome you as the President of the Security Council and to extend my gratitude to the delegation of Viet Nam for today's initiative of convening an open debate of the Council to discuss the status of implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). We would like to thank the Deputy Secretary-General for her presentation of the thematic report on this topic (S\/2009\/465).  Since the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), we have been able to accomplish a great deal to improve the situation of women in armed conflicts. We note with satisfaction that the range of issues discussed today enjoys the growing attention not only of the Security Council, but also of other competent United Nations entities, including the General Assembly, the Peacebuilding Commission, the Human Rights Council, the Economic and Social Council and its functional commissions, including the Commission on the Status of Women. That having been said, the successes achieved are insufficient to improve the struggle on the ground against violations of women's rights.  Resolution 1325 (2000) remains the effective reference for enhancing women's roles in preventing and settling armed conflicts, in post-conflict reconstruction and in the protection of women's rights in conflict situations. There is a need in practice to exploit the resolution's provisions in the process of creating equal opportunities for the participation of women in all peacebuilding and security efforts, as well as in bolstering their role in decision-making.  The basis for this approach is to ensure genuine gender equality. Women can stand to make a more substantial contribution to all aspects of preventing and settling conflict. Moreover, there is a need to devote greater attention to mainstreaming the gender component into the poverty reduction and equality work of the United Nations, poverty and inequality being the main sources of conflict. In particular, we can refer here to the expanded participation by women in decision-making on socio-economic issues and the elaboration of national frameworks to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  We welcome resolution 1888 (2009), adopted on 30 September, on sexual violence during armed conflicts. However, sexual violence is far from being the only problem with respect to violations of women's rights. We must bear in mind that women and children continue to fall victim to premeditated attacks, including terrorist acts, indiscriminate or excessive use of force, as well as other violations of international humanitarian law.  The varied nature of Violence should lead us to devote due attention to all its categories. In that connection, we view resolutions 1820 (2008) and 1888 (2009) as complementing resolution 1325 (2000), which sets out the general parameters for the protection of women in armed conflicts.  Next year, we will commemorate the tenth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000). In that regard, the Russian Federation welcomes the idea of organizing a set of events in 2009 and 2010 at the national, regional and global levels in order to spread awareness of that document. We cherish the hope that such events will be used not only to report successes achieved in implementing the provisions of resolution 1325 (2000), but also to consider and gain an understanding of outstanding problems and of further steps to bolster the regime for the protection of women in armed conflicts.  ",
    " May I begin by congratulating Viet Nam on its assumption of the presidency of the Security Council and wish them every success for the month of October. I would like to thank, of course, the American delegation for having exercised the presidency last month.  We welcome the initiative taken by Viet Nam in organizing this public debate on women and peace and security, which is dedicated to responding to the needs of women in post-conflict situations. Much has been done, particularly by the United Nations, to implement resolution 1325 (2000), but these efforts must be continued.  First and foremost, the Council has endeavoured to systematically introduce the approach recommended by resolution 1325 (2000) into the mandates of peacekeeping operations and to persuade the parties to conflicts to themselves incorporate this approach in the peace process.  Subsequently, the Secretariat and the agencies, funds and programmes have stepped up activities to protect women, including in post-conflict situations. I would in this connection like to warmly congratulate Ms. Rachel Mayanja, Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, Mr. Alain Le Roy, Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, and Ms. Ine's Alberdi, Executive Director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). I also thank Ms. Asha Hagi Elmi Amin for her testimony to us.  The Secretary-General's report (S\/2009\/465) reflects the proliferation of initiatives aimed at training peacekeeping operations personnel, assist women who are the victims of violence and combat impunity. These initiatives include the one carried out by France, in partnership with UNICEF, aimed at reintegrating child soldiers into civil society.  But the United Nations is not alone in acting. The European Union has also demonstrated the importance it attaches to the protection of women by adopting guidelines on violence against women. It has also, at France's instigation, adopted a comprehensive policy regarding the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and an updated operational document on the European policy for security and defence in this regard.  The majority of this task, however, remains to be carried out. A long list remains of dramatic situations that the international community must tackle, including abuses committed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nepal, Burma, the Central African Republic and Burundi. These examples serve as reminders to us.  Less than a week after the important adoption of resolution 1888 (2009), aimed at bolstering the efforts of the international community to combat sexual violence in armed conflict, the new resolution that the Council has just adopted incorporates major advances to improve implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). The definition of indicators by the Secretariat over the coming months to allow all interested parties to follow more closely the progress that has been made in implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) is a first step that is both practical and useful.  I also welcome the fact that the Council has taken to heart the observation made before it on 30 September by the French Minister of State for Cooperation and la Francophonie, who stated that transparency, cooperation and coordination of efforts between the Special Representative of the Secretary- General for Children and Armed Conflict and a new special representative of the Secretary-General for sexual violence and armed conflict will be essential. In addition, the Council has for the first time adopted forceful language regarding the medical needs of women who have been the victims of rape or other sexual violence, particularly sexual and reproductive health.  France believes that certain organizational steps to be taken by the Secretariat, particularly within the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Political Affairs, will make it possible to better take into account the role of women in crisis planning and in preparation for emerging from crisis, thus ensuring a better implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  The path to follow is therefore clear, and it is up to us to embark on that path. In order take stock of the progress that has been made and will be made in this regard, France supports the recommendation of the Secretary-General to organize a ministerial meeting at United Nations Headquarters on the tenth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) in October 2010.

    " One of the most difficult and important tasks facing the United Nations is to ensure that nations emerging from devastating conflicts are not allowed to slide back into violence. Building peace may sound straightforward, but we know from painful experience that it is not. Success requires patience, long-term commitment and the involvement of a wide range of actors working together. We face real difficulties every day as our field missions, funds, programmes and agencies, each in their own way, work to provide the kind of help that nations need to rebuild after war. We feel keenly and constantly the need to do better.  It was in that spirit that my report last year on peacebuilding in the immediate aftermath of conflict (S\/2009\/304) set out an agenda for action to help the United Nations deliver more rapid and effective support to national peacebuilding efforts and to ensure that the impacts of those activities would endure.  We are making progress in Burundi, Haiti, Nepal, Sierra Leone and elsewhere. Let us remember that for people who have suffered through conflict, progress cannot come fast enough. The ultimate test is how well 10-57830 we deliver on the ground and how well we give people signs of hope, beyond mere words and promises.  One year since I issued that report, I am pleased to report that we have made real gains in carrying forward the specific recommendations I put forward aimed at better organizing our peacebuilding efforts. But we still have further to go. I see four areas that require our particular attention.  First, we need to get the right people in the right place at the right time. We now deploy special representatives and other United Nations leaders more rapidly to crisis situations. All senior staff now have managerial compacts to define their goals and priorities and to improve their accountability.  The demands on leaders in crisis situations are growing. They are now expected to implement broader Security Council mandates, provide a strategic vision, ensure proper coordination and undertake joint planning. We need to give them the properly trained and equipped support teams that will enable them to perform the full range of their responsibilities right from the very beginning.  Such demands underpin the review of international civilian capacities that is currently under way. The review is anchored in the need to ensure that international assistance in the aftermath of conflict is driven by national needs and priorities, that we make better use of the capacities of women and the global South, and that our responses become faster and more flexible. I look forward to the recommendations of the Senior Advisory Group for the Review of International Civilian Capacities, led by Jean-Marie Guehenno, early next year. Meanwhile, I encourage all Member States to be engaged in and contribute to the outcome of the review.  Secondly, we need predictable financing. Whatever type of United Nations presence there is, we and our national partners need sufficient and timely funding, especially in the middle of a crisis response. In fragile transition situations, the Peacebuilding Fund can quickly finance early action, which can in turn prompt other sources to provide longer-term funding. The Fund has streamlined its procedures, enabling it to respond more swiftly to urgent needs. I encourage Member States to contribute to its replenishment.  But the Fund is only one among many. Many other efforts are under way, aimed at making all 10-57830 peacebuilding financing more flexible and tolerant of risk. I urge Member States to support these as well.  Thirdly, we need more effective partnerships. Greater cooperation and joint approaches within the United Nations are important, but they are not enough. We must build deeper strategic partnerships. With that in mind, we have begun strengthening cooperation and developing closer institutional links with the World Bank.  Partnerships work best when roles are clear. Greater clarity and deeper capacities are being established in core areas such as mine action, mediation and electoral assistance, but we still need to review the institutional arrangement in areas such as security sector reform and the rule of law. To this end, I am encouraging a frank examination of the comparative advantages of various United Nations actors and other partners, based on available capacities and presence. This will be an important priority in the coming months, and I rely on the support of the Council.  One of the most important partnerships is the one between the Security Council and the Peacebuilding Commission. A closer collaboration can help the Council to support peacebuilding more effectively from the very start, including by enabling peacekeeping operations to have an impact as early peacebuilders and by ensuring that integrated peacebuilding offices institutionalize these early achievements.  With respect to the recent review of our peacebuilding architecture, I look forward to the outcome of discussions by the Council and the General Assembly.  Fourthly, we need to put women at the heart of peacebuilding. That is where women should be, not only because of their peacebuilding needs, but above all because of their capacities. Yet we have not truly achieved this, nor have we fully implemented resolution 1325 (2000). While their voices are critical for ensuring that the foundations of peace are just and equitable, women are still not systematically included at all stages of the peace process.  My new report on women's participation in peacebuilding (S\/20lO\/466) provides a comprehensive strategy to address these challenges. It identifies the hurdles women confront in seven key areas: mediation, 3 post-conflict planning, financing, civilian capacity, post-conflict governance, the rule of law and economic recovery. It makes specific commitments for each, thereby providing a framework for the full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  But that did not happen without dedicated funding for women's needs. Conflicts leave States severely weakened and social structures decimated. In such situations, women are vital to ensuring that the basic survival needs of families and communities are met. I have therefore stipulated that all peacebuilding funds managed by the United Nations will henceforth allocate 15 per cent of their funds to projects that address women's specific needs, advance gender equality or empower women. Advancing the cause of women and peace and security enhances the legitimacy of peace processes and governance structures. It must be an integral part of our peacebuilding efforts, not an afterthought.  The work of rebuilding societies broken by conflict requires long-term commitment, a truly integrated approach and significant amounts of human, financial and institutional resources. There is no set sequence of peacemaking, followed by peacekeeping, followed by peacebuilding, but rather a need for us to be flexible and bring our tools into play at the appropriate moments.  It is essential for us to develop the peacebuilding architecture and promote greater coherence within the United Nations system. Meeting these challenges will bring us closer to our overarching goal of building sustainable peace. I will continue to rely on the Council's support and cooperation in that endeavour.  ",
    " My delegation fully associates itself with the statement just delivered on behalf of the European Union.  At the outset, I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on having organized this important debate. We highly appreciate the efforts of your country to promote the post-conflict peacebuilding. The July 2009 ministerial debate held on your initiative (see S\/PV.6165) and today's follow-up constitute the best proof of Uganda's commitment to peacebuilding.  Let me take this opportunity to stress that the Czech Republic fully shares your appreciation of the importance of the early post-conflict peacebuilding. Experience over the past decade clearly shows that United Nations peacekeeping operations alone are not sufficient for breaking the vicious circle of countries relapsing into new conflicts. Peacekeeping must be accompanied by peacebuilding efforts from the early stages of the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers. The character of recent conflicts has changed, and the United Nations has to adapt accordingly. The report of the Secretary-General on peacebuilding in the immediate aftermath of conflict (S\/2009\/304) and his July progress report (S\/2010\/386) clearly demonstrate the general acknowledgment of this fact. The Czech Republic devotes great attention to the work of the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC), a body within the United Nations system which helps countries with their peacebuilding efforts. This year's PBC review process gave us an opportunity to take stock of achieved results and to formulate recommendations for the improvement of the Commission's future work.  We welcome the fact that during the four years of its existence the Peacebuilding Commission has established very fruitful working relations with the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council. But there is still room for improvement. Looking at the PBC working methods laid down in the founding resolutions, we can see that the Commission has not yet started to formulate the exit criteria for disengagements.  Also, cooperation with the Security Council could be further developed. According to its mandate, the PBC should advise the Security Council not only on the countries on its agenda, but also on those in the process of becoming a subject of a future peacekeeping operation, as well as those finding themselves in the phase of an operation withdrawal.  In that vein, we welcome the decision to include Liberia in the PBC's agenda. For the first time, a country where a robust peacekeeping operation is still deployed has been placed on the agenda. That will create new challenges for the PBC and new experience will be gained.  Everything is seen as a priority in a country that is emerging from a conflict. Helping such a country in its vast peacebuilding efforts requires the availability of a broad range of experts from different fields, covering areas from security sector reform, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, the restoration of core Government functions and the building of national administration, education and health to the revitalization of the economy. In those circumstances, it is impossible to provide the required expertise without civilian capacity. We must therefore improve the process of identifying, deploying and employing civilian experts. Close cooperation with non-governmental organizations is indispensable.  In welcoming the second report of the Secretary- General before us today, that is, women's participation in peacebuilding, my delegation would like to underline the attention given to the role of women in peacebuilding. Women represent more than half of the active population and bear an important part of the peacebuilding activities. Without the active participation of women, it would not be possible to succeed in peacebuilding efforts, as many delegations have outlined. We therefore support the seven-point action plan contained in the Secretary-General's report.  In closing, I would like to stress the importance of ensuring that all actors involved in peacekeeping, including all parts of the United Nations system, financial institutions, regional and subregional organizations and donors, forge close cooperation. We are convinced that the United Nations should play a leading role in that process.  ",
    " We thank the United States presidency for organizing today's meeting.  We are grateful to the Secretary-General and Ms. Wallstrom, Mr. Le Roy and General Gaye for the important information that they have provided.  Unfortunately, in spite of the existence of an entire arsenal of international instruments on human rights and international humanitarian law, civilian populations continue to be subjected to violence and to suffer in armed conflicts and in post-conflict situations. Sexual violence is, of course, a repulsive crime that requires decisive condemnation and severe punishment. We are thus especially alarmed at situations where this phenomenon is becoming widespread and systematic. It is becoming an instrument in armed conflict.  Recent events in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have shown how acute the problem can be. We advocate a thorough investigation of all incidents and punishment of the guilty. Only in this way can we put an end to the reign of impunity that criminals enjoy, in the overwhelming majority of cases, and thereby eradicate that reprehensible practice.  We are, however, of the view that combating sexual violence is one of the major components of all of the measures that can be used for settlement and post-conflict recovery. We are convinced that, in concentrating efforts on combating sexual violence, we must pay due attention to other abuses committed during conflict. Civilian populations - most of all, women and children - are still victims of other crimes as well, such as premeditated attacks, including terrorist acts, and indiscriminate or excessive use of force. Often, the criminals escape punishment here as well. As we see it, the diverse nature of violence during armed conflict requires appropriate attention to all its categories. The issues of women and peace and security must be based on a comprehensive approach, which is the approach that is enshrined in resolution 1325 (2000), which is the fundamental document for the protection of women and which ensures their rights in conflicts. Moreover, we believe that women should not be perceived only as victims. We must remember that an important precondition for overcoming violence against women is their full-fledged participation in peace talks and in post-conflict peacebuilding.  We are grateful to the Secretary-General for his thematic report for today's meeting (S\/2010\/604). A number of proposals in the document to strengthen our fight against sexual violence have been embodied in a practical manner in today's resolution. We support the recommendation of giving the Secretary-General the right to make lists of parties suspected of sexual violence in conflict. Such an instrument, as we have seen in our Council experience with children's issues, is a very effective way of having an impact on violators. With respect to agreements on monitoring, analysis and accountability regarding sexual violence in conditions of armed conflict, that mechanism is undoubtedly extremely important. The timelines, accuracy, objectivity and reliability of its information will determine the effectiveness and usefulness of Council decisions to rectify the situation.  There are many different types of conflict around the globe. However, from the standpoint of the Council's purposes under the Charter, the Council's attention must be focused only on those conflicts which are a threat to peace and security. Consequently, the instruments adopted today, such as the practice of making lists of violators and agreements on monitoring, analysis and accountability, must also be used in that context.  I would also like to emphasize that the efforts of the international community will be in vain without the consent and active participation of national Governments, which have the major responsibility for handling the entire range of issues to care for and protect their people.  In conclusion, we would like to express our conviction that today's resolution will play an important role in dealing with the problems of violence against women in armed conflicts. ",
    " Let me begin by extending our congratulations to you, Mr. President, and your delegation on your presidency of the Security Council for the month of October, and by assuring you of the full support of my delegation. I also thank you and your delegation for initiating this meeting and bringing the Council together to discuss an issue that is critically important to the Republic of Croatia and, surely, to all nations.  Allow me to extend a warm welcome to Ms. Michelle Bachelet and wish her success in her future work as the first Executive Director of the newly established gender entity, UN Women, and Under- Secretary-General for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. Given her high political stature and experience, we deem that Ms. Bachelet will enhance the gender equality agenda and that UN Women will grow into the principal voice for gender mainstreaming and the empowerment of women. Croatia aligns itself with the statement delivered by the representative of Belgium on behalf of the European Union. Here, I would like to make additional remarks in my national capacity.  The adoption by the Security Council of resolution 1325 (2000) bears testimony to the progress made during the past decade in the area of women and peace and security. This historic resolution has focused much-needed attention on the question of women's empowerment, which represents a priority for my country. While all the resolutions on women and peace and security are equally important, resolution 1325 (2000) serves as an umbrella resolution in addressing women's empowerment, their task as peacebuilders and their fragile position as victims of war.  The Republic of Croatia welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of this landmark resolution (S\/2010\/498), the recommendations contained therein, as well as the presidential statement adopted by the Council today(S\/PRST\/2010\/22). We call upon the Security Council to endorse the indicators developed by the Secretary-General as soon as possible.  The commitments set forth by the resolution are commendable, but translating words into action is the only way of resolving the remaining issues - and the issues are many. As numerous situations on the agenda of this Council have shown, women still have a long way to go in order to fulfil their empowerment goals as well as to fully realize their human rights, both in times of war and peace. The empowerment of women is imperative to the full achievement of human rights, as well as to overall economic and political development and progress. Although women are widely recognized as effective agents of peace, they still have little access to decision-making positions and peace negotiations. More should be done.  Armed conflicts continue to have a devastating impact on women and girls and are often accompanied by gender-based violence, including the increasing scale and brutality of sexual violence, often used as a means of war. Impunity for such acts of violence against women is still prevalent and the prosecution rate very low.  Even on Croatian territory, in the heart of Europe, rape was used as a method of intimidation and terror during the aggression to which Croatia was exposed in the early 19905. We are fully aware of the role both the Security Council and the international community can play in addressing sexual violence against women and girls, especially when used by political or military leaders as a means of achieving political or military objectives. We believe that the Security Council needs to provide strong and effective leadership on this issue, including by taking concrete action when necessary, with the ultimate aim of eradicating this abhorrent behaviour. Such acts of violence demand further action by the Security Council to strengthen the rule of law and to end impunity. They need to be thoroughly investigated and perpetrators brought to account, and it is therefore imperative for the International Criminal Court, as well as national courts, to be the last instance of justice for the victims and a reminder that there can be no tolerance for the crime of rape.  We are pleased to see that progress has been made in several areas and that the United Nations system continues to engage in a wide range of good practices. We encourage the strengthening of the coordination among United Nations agencies both at Headquarters and in the field, especially in monitoring and reporting on situations where parties to armed conflict engage in rape and other sexual violence as a means of war. Nevertheless, more consistent and comprehensive reporting on sexual violence would enable the Council to address the protection of women and children in a more systematic manner, whereas the Council should include specific reporting requirements in resolutions establishing or renewing mandates.  More needs to be done also at the national level. The integration of the resolution has to be country- driven, and Member States need to take responsibility for its success by ensuring that it is integrated into national policies. We urge countries to apply a broad gender-mainstreaming approach across Government, for instance through a system-wide approach that links development, humanitarian and defence issues. All plans should include civil society consultations, as well as monitoring and reporting mechanisms.  I am pleased to say that Croatia has taken steps to integrate the gender perspective into its national security policy through its national strategy for the promotion of gender equality, and is currently developing its national action plan on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), which is expected to be adopted in 2011. Under the leadership of its first female Prime Minister, Croatia will continue to give its firm support to all areas of the women and peace and security agenda. We see it as a gender-based peace agenda that involves addressing the disproportionate effect of conflict on women and combating sexual violence. It is also about securing the full, equal and effective participation of women at all stages of the peace process, giving them an equal role in the prevention and resolution of conflicts, as well as in peacebuilding. The realization of these goals is essential to safeguarding basic human rights and achieving human security and lasting peace.  ",
    " First, I wish to thank you, Madame, for organizing today's open debate. I would also like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Special Representative Wallstrom, Under-Secretary- General Le Roy and Lieutenant General Gaye for their comprehensive briefings. Wartime sexual violence has been the subject of one of history's greatest silences for long enough. While the Security Council has adopted landmark resolutions to try to combat what has been termed a weapon of war, United Nations actors on the ground still lack the necessary tools to fight this war crime.  Resolution 1960 (2010), adopted by the Council today, provides them with some of these needed tools. The Council has requested the Secretary-General to list, in an annex to his annual report, parties that are credibly suspected of committing or being responsible for patterns of rape and other forms of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict on the Security Council's agenda. Hence, the Council is not only signalling to rapists in conflict zones around the world that their acts will no longer go unchecked, but also opening the way for more direct and constructive United Nations engagement with those parties, upon whom we call to make specific and time-bound commitments to combating sexual violence.  Sexual violence is not inevitable. It is not cultural and should not be considered as collateral damage. When used systematically as a weapon of war, its purpose is to break the will of people by dominating them in humiliating and dehumanizing ways. It has dire consequences not only on the populations against whom it is perpetrated, but also on international peace and security, as it poses enduring challenges to durable stability and social cohesion. It is therefore our collective responsibility to put an end to it.  It is my Government's hope that today's resolution will establish formal monitoring, analysis and reporting arrangements on conflict-related sexual violence, and generate insightful analysis of trends and patterns to better protect affected populations and inform targeted measures. It is also important to further reinforce trust between local communities and United Nations peacekeeping missions on the ground and to establish effective channels of communication that would provide timely and accurate information in the event of rapes.  Female peacekeepers and women protection advisors are crucial in this sense. Where they have been present, local populations have more readily reported on instances of sexual violence. Today's resolution unequivocally supports their presence and the need to mainstream them. Furthermore, we welcome the development by the Secretariat of scenario-based training materials on combating sexual violence for peacekeepers, and we encourage Member States to use them.  Although the tools we have formalized today through resolution 1960 (2010) will undoubtedly make a difference in our efforts to end conflicts through a fair and lasting peace, the accompanying establishment of functional governmental institutions and the rule of law remain the international community's best bet for providing populations with the protection they deserve, for ending impunity and for enabling victims and communities to begin their painstaking recovery.  My country welcomes the adoption of resolution 1960 (2010) today and the clear signal it sends from the international community to perpetrators of the savage crimes of sexual violence around the world that we will not stand idly by as the bodies of women are turned into battlegrounds and that those perpetrators will be held accountable for their acts.  ",
    " I thank you, Mr. President, for organizing this briefing. We welcome Special Representative Margot Wallstrom and Assistant Secretary-General Rachel Mayanja, and thank them greatly for their important presentations.  In almost 10 years since the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), the international community has come a long way. We have come to understand more fully the implications of armed conflict for women and have also become more aware of their specific needs and roles in maintaining or restoring peace and security. Through resolution 1820 (2008), we have recognized the gravity of sexual violence in armed conflicts and have enhanced our action against it.  Resolution 1325 (2000) deals with women as agents of peace. Such a role comprises many facets, ranging from conflict prevention to post-conflict peacebuilding. I would like to briefly touch upon two such facets.  The first regards institutions. In post-conflict scenarios, where institutions are rebuilt and gradually consolidated, there is often a window of opportunity to surmount historical gender inequalities or insensitivities. It is precisely when the distribution of power and roles within a society is being redrawn after the trauma of war that efforts must be made to ensure that the concerns and needs of women are duly contemplated. That is especially applicable to such processes as constitutional, political and educational reforms.  The second aspect that I wish to stress relates to the economic empowerment of women in post-conflict situations, which is as important as institutional empowerment. The participation of women in efforts to rehabilitate and reactivate the economy is of particular relevance. Given the fundamental role played by women in key economic sectors, particularly in agriculture, the impact of development projects can be enhanced if such projects are focused on women.  Resolutions 1888 (2009) and 1889 (2009) took us further in our endeavours regarding women, peace and security, as they helped us to translate a wider awareness of challenges and opportunities into effective action. Among the decisions taken by the Security Council in those resolutions, two are particularly relevant due to their potential implications in the mid- and long terms. The first is the request to the Secretary-General to submit a set of indicators to track the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). The development of indicators is meant to allow for more rigorous and results-oriented interventions.  We appreciate the hard work that has gone into the report before us today. We look forward to the consultative process that will follow and give all stakeholders the opportunity to contribute to the further development of the proposed indicators. In that effort, we should consider the importance of focusing on qualitative rather than quantitative ways of measuring progress and of ensuring flexibility as challenges facing each country are different and should be recognized and treated as such. It would be important to guard against putting additional reporting burdens on developing States, especially those emerging from conflict. Collecting and aggregating data and preparing reports can be challenging tasks. Instead of being a mechanism for academic analysis, the indicators must support countries in their practical efforts to improve the situation of women in post-conflict situations.  The second important decision of the Security Council in 2009 regarding women, peace and security was the establishment of the post of Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict. It provides the United Nations system with an authoritative voice empowered to provide coherent and strategic leadership in the fight against sexual violence in conflict. It fills a void in helping different parts of the system to work more closely and effectively together.  We welcome Ms. Wallstrom's appointment to the position. We support her two forward-looking recommendations of continuous attention and of making prevention a top priority. We also support her five-point agenda, as it proposes a balanced set of measures focused both on the past and on the future, on accountability and on cooperation, on the perpetrators and on command responsibilities, and adds the very welcome focus on peer liability.  We commend Mrs. Wallstrom's initiative to visit the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We encourage and support increased efforts at cooperation with the Congolese Government in addressing capacity-building and other needs in the fight against sexual violence. We also appreciate the measures that have been taken by the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to improve women's security on the ground.  In concluding, let me also thank the Japanese delegation for preparing the draft presidential statement before us, which we fully support.  ",
    " I thank you, Mr. President, for convening this debate. France endorses the statement to be delivered by the representative of the European Union.  I think that everyone around this table is in broad agreement regarding the need to improve the effectiveness of the means by which the international community takes action to prevent a country recently emerged from conflict from relapsing into a crisis. I believe there is also consensus on the fact that this is a long-term and difficult endeavour. It is difficult because it requires that institutions with very different practices and traditions, and that clearly cherish their autonomy, work together. It is also difficult because we must simultaneously conduct a set of very different tasks - from the disarmament of armed groups to the strengthening of State institutions - and because one cannot employ a sequential approach. As we have already heard in this Chamber, we have to simultaneously conduct peacekeeping and lay the groundwork for peacebuilding. Lastly, it is difficult because we must better assess the risks associated with new threats, such as drug and human trafficking, organized crime and even corruption, which have great potential to destabilize fragile countries.  In this respect, I believe that there is no more telling example of what we are discussing here than the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I am not the first to cite this example. We know that we cannot indefinitely remain in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but that we can withdraw the United Nations forces only if we leave behind State institutions that are sufficiently sound to ensure the development and stability of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We will do so, of course, alongside the Congolese authorities.  These reconstruction tasks are tremendous. Moreover, we might well ask ourselves whether the area is really in a post-conflict situation. It is therefore essential that a responsible relationship be established between the authorities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the actors of the international community as a whole.  The United Nations have drafted a state reconstruction plan for Kivu - the stabilization and reconstruction plan for areas emerging from armed conflict - and we must ensure that all the international institutions, in particular the European Union, which is the leading donor to and backer of countries emerging from crisis, work together towards the same goal. There is a need for synergy. Given the gravity of the crisis from which the Democratic Republic of the Congo has only recently emerged, it is the primary challenge for our Organization.  We have examples of relative success. Sierra Leone was raised as an example by my British colleague, but we also have the positive experiences of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic and the United Nations Integrated Office in Burundi. We must learn from these experiences insofar as they guarantee a political dialogue with the authorities of the host country and close coordination in the reconstruction efforts led by various United Nations agencies.  The withdrawal strategy for these offices should be carefully prepared - because these situations are looming already and will continue to be an issue - in order to avoid opening new gaps or the re-emergence of tensions due to a lack of resources or attention from the international community. There is no one-size-fits- all solution. Each problem must be considered on a case-by-case basis by the international community.  We are closely following the work of the Senior Advisory Group for the Review of International Civilian Capacities, led by Mr. Jean-Marie Guehenno. This matter was raised by Mr. Peter Wittig and the Ambassador of Austria. We are awaiting bold recommendations to better meet the real needs of post- conflict countries and the competencies available at the international level from other Member States and our system as a whole.  To work towards peacebuilding as soon as an armed conflict has ended is to pay due attention to the contribution of women as a key aspect of peacebuilding. How could we imagine setting aside half of a society that is trying to rebuild itself? Leaving women out would undoubtedly pave the way for future disasters. That is why we believe that women must have access to decision-making in the political, economic, social and cultural arenas in a more systematic manner and on an equal footing with men. In this regard, we fully support the work of the Secretary-General and we invite the United Nations system - and above all UN Women and its Executive Director, Ms. Bachelet - to implement it.  We have been discussing this matter for a long time. It is a complex task, but we have unfortunate examples in Timor-Leste and Haiti demonstrating that, without integrating the peacebuilding stage into the very design and implementation of peacekeeping operations, we will fail. We must therefore continue to improve the resources at our disposal. That is why, Sir, I thank you once again for organizing this debate.  ",
    " Allow me first to thank you, Mr. President, for organizing this important and timely debate. Allow me also to thank His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon; Mrs. Asha-Rose Migiro, Deputy Secretary-General; Ms. Michelle Bachelet, Under-Secretary-General for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women; Mr. Alain Le Roy, Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations; His Excellency Mr. Hamidon Ali, President of the Economic and Social Council; and Ms. Thelma Awori for their briefings. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome the Ministers participating in our debate today.  As we mark the tenth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), let us take this opportunity to examine the progress that has been achieved, as well as the challenges that persist. Over the past decade, the United Nations system, Member States and civil society have made significant efforts to implement resolution 1325 (2000) through a wide spectrum of measures and initiatives. Considerable progress has been made in increasing awareness of the threat that sexual violence constitutes to peace and security and of the cost of excluding women from peace processes. In the 10 years since the adoption of the resolution, many steps have been taken on the ground, including  increasing the number of gender advisers, the adoption of guidelines for field action and the elaboration of a System-wide Action Plan. Member States have organized consultations and developed national action plans, and civil society organizations have stepped up their activities to support the role of women in areas of conflict and post-conflict. The creation of a new United Nations gender entity and the appointment of President Michelle Bachelet as its head, the appointment of Ms. Margot Wallstrom as the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict and the creation of a High-Level Steering Committee for Women, Peace and Security have generated unique momentum within the United Nations and beyond.  However, despite these important efforts, the conditions that women and girls face in situations of armed conflict continue to be abhorrent, and effective methods for monitoring the impact of the measures put in place to protect them are lacking, as pointed out by the Secretary-General in his report (S\/2010\/498). Rape continues to be used unabated as a weapon of war, as the events of July 2010 in the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo shockingly reminded us. Out of 300 peace agreements negotiated since 1989, only 18 contain even a passing reference to sexual violence, which remains the least-condemned war crime. Of particular concern is the problem of sexual violence against displaced women, a phenomenon that is widespread and growing. One way to ensure prevention and a more effective response to such acts of violence is through the dissemination of the guidelines established by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee.  As they care for their families and raise their children, women play a crucial role in restoring the fabric of society and overcoming war wounds. Yet, their own wounds are still not being properly remedied. In that regard, reforming the security sector and ensuring respect for the rule of law in a gender- responsive manner is of crucial importance. Conflict and post-conflict societies should be assisted in those areas at the earliest possible moment in order to ensure that the police and military do not abuse the very population whom they are supposed to be protecting.  In recent peace negotiations, women represented less than 8 per cent of the participants and less than 3 per cent of the signatories. That endangers the prospects for long-lasting peace since women are crucial partners in shoring up three of its pillars: economic recovery, social cohesion and political legitimacy, as affirmed by the Secretary-General in his recent report (S\/2010\/466).  Including women in peace talks is not enough by itself. In some post-conflict societies, women who have been victims of sexual violence, widows and orphan girls are ostracized, exacerbating the challenges that they must overcome and compromising the prospects for enduring peace. Hence, more concerted efforts must be made in order to raise awareness among men and sensitize them to the importance of safeguarding women's rights for durable peace and the well-being of society as a whole.  A shortfall in the financing of women's needs in post-conflict recovery plans persists. Donors could play a very constructive role in that regard by supporting women's and girls' education. Donors should also help women to attain economic independence through land ownership, micro-enterprise and skills training.  As pointed out by the Secretary-General, Member States must ensure that their support for women's engagement in peacebuilding is consistent. While Governments have the primary responsibility to take action in their countries, when need be, they must be able to count on the predictable support of United Nations partners. Despite the increase in female participation in United Nations missions, only 3 per cent of uniformed peacekeepers and 8 per cent of United Nations police are women. Increasing their numbers would help improve the sense of security of women in vulnerable situations.  Finally, efforts to implement resolution 1325 (2000) should be more coherent. There is, therefore, a need for a strategic framework that includes well-defined targets and indicators. The preliminary set of indicators annexed to the Secretary-General's report (S\/2010\/498), is an important tool for taking stock of the progress achieved and for tracking the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) in conflict and post-conflict situations. The indicators should not be seen as a reporting obligation, but rather as a means to facilitate Member States' engagement. Progress should not be measured exclusively through data and figures, and each indicator should be read in its specific context.  Over the next decade, our success in protecting women in conflict situations will be measured by the real impact that our actions have on the ground. The framework and tools are there. Let us make sure that we back them with the necessary political will.  ",
    " I thank you, Madam President, for convening today's debate, which offers us all an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to protecting and ensuring women's rights and their momentous role in peace and security. I also take the opportunity to thank the Secretary-General for his report (S\/2011\/598*) and his strong words of support. And I thank Ms. Michelle Bachelet, Under-Secretary- General for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, for her work and for her statement.  The history of war and violence has left a disconcerting impact on my country. Violence still takes its toll on every Afghan's life. I hope that the anguish facing every Afghan family will one day come to an end. Women continue to bear the bulk of the burden of conflict in Afghanistan, while their right to secure, healthy and prosperous lives is still in peril. We meet today to recognize the crucial role of women in the peaceful resolution of conflicts, the tangible fruits of which have already been seen in Afghanistan in the decisive presence of women at the Consultative Peace Jirga in 2010 and in the continuing efforts to ensure women's participation in leadership positions within and outside of the Afghan Government. The debate is particularly appropriate as Afghanistan is entering the second phase of transition to Afghan leadership and ownership and increased responsibility for security and economic development.  With regard to development, we have begun to implement our 10-year national action plan for the women of Afghanistan based upon the priorities of the Afghanistan National Development Strategy. As part of the action plan, we have established gender units in 14 of the 25 Government ministries. However, given the 10-year timeline, accelerated efforts are necessary to ensure the full implementation of that very comprehensive action plan, which incorporates vital goals that include achieving a 30 per cent rate of representation of women in governmental positions by the end of 2013 and their 35 per cent participation rate among university students by the end of 2012.  We have also made strides in ensuring the rule of law, most recently the establishment of a national commission on the elimination of violence against women, following the enactment of the law in that regard in December 2010. Those steps have been vital in enhancing Afghan women's access to legal redress and have also sent a strong message that the Afghanistan Government is committed to the rights of women and to ensuring that there is no impunity for those who violate them.  Ensuring the rights of women is only half of the battle; we also need to see the full participation of women, as resolution 1325 (2000) reminds us that they have a vital role to play in peace and security. The representation of women in governance and their political participation has steadily increased. We have succeeded in holding two presidential and two parliamentary elections, in which women actively participated as candidates, elections staff, poll monitors and electorates.  Women comprise 25 per cent of the Parliament, thus ranking Afghanistan thirtieth among the countries of the world with the highest rate of women representatives in Parliament. The Afghanistan National Parliament has also established a resource centre for women parliamentarians to enhance their capacity to effectively include women's voices and perspectives in national development and reconstruction plans.  When reviewing these facts and figures, let us not lose sight of the great personal risk that these women undertake in order to participate in the governance of their country and in their future. I wish to take this opportunity to honour the women who continue take risks in order to assume an active role in the future direction, peace and security of our country.  Our international partners have assisted the Afghan Government in our endeavours. UN-Women has administered a multi-donor trust fund for the elimination of violence against women that provided grants for national organizations to combat violence against women. I am very pleased to report that, in collaboration with UN-Women, Afghanistan has submitted its first country report on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The continued collaboration of our Government, international partners and both Afghan and international civil society groups will be vital to ensure the full realization of women's rights in a strong and stable Afghanistan.  Building a stable and secure environment that enables women to live free of intimidation and violence and promotes their participation and leadership in efforts to maintain peace and security is one of the core objectives of the Afghan Government.  We are also focusing on women political actors at national, subnational and local levels, as well as on capacity-building and advocacy strategies to enable them to obtain critical roles in high-level decision- making processes, policy and law-making positions in key Government institutions and to assist them in carrying out their significant political and social responsibilities.  In conclusion, with the support of our partners and the international community, we will continue to work towards the full implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), while recognizing that our goal of sustainable peace and security in Afghanistan will not be achieved without the full participation of the entire Afghan nation.  ",
    " It is an honour for me to participate in this debate during your presidency, Madam, which itself reflects the level of participation that we hope will become increasingly accessible to larger numbers of women. It pleases me even more, given the important contribution that your country, Nigeria, and other Member States have made towards the creation and maintenance of an environment of peace in Liberia. It is that enabling environment, coupled with visionary leadership and strong partnerships, which has allowed the Liberian Government to pursue policies that provide opportunities for the advancement and empowerment of Liberian women.  Already one year has passed since we commemorated the tenth anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000) with many activities, including a similar debate in this very Council (S\/PV.6411); a plethora of commitments by Member States to translate the major tenets of that resolution into smart national action plans; the adoption of initial indicators to measure progress; and a request that the Secretary-General develop a strategic framework to guide the United Nations implementation of the resolution. It remains our challenge to meet the expectations that have been raised by those activities.  We commend the Secretary-General on his report on women and peace and security (S\/201l\/598*), which reflects a laudable effort to use the indicators currently available in assessing progress. The report provides some insights into good practices and progress made by Member States, regional and international organizations, as well as constraints in the global effort to fully engage women in all national processes, whether they concern peace and security or political or socio-economic development. We broadly support those recommendations.  Liberia continues to make progress in its efforts to involve women at decision-making levels in all areas of national governance. At critical junctures in Liberia's history, its women have demonstrated the ability to lead. Liberia holds the distinct honour of being the birthplace and home of the first woman and the first African to be appointed President of the General Assembly at its twenty-fourth session in 1970.  In recent history, during a lull in the protracted conflict, Liberia had a female interim President, in the person of Mrs. Ruth Perry, who steered the work of a transitional Government from 1996 to 1997. Then there were the unsung heroes - the countless number of women who bravely shouldered the responsibility of caring for their families, even as they participated in discussions on peace and security, while living in the internally displaced persons and refugee camps across West Africa and further afield.  The year 2003 marked another milestone, when a group of Liberian women, led by Leymah Gbowee, appeared, uninvited, at the door of a negotiation room in Accra and vowed not to move or be moved until a peace accord was signed. Their resolve and determination were expressed in a simple song with a persistent refrain: \"We want peace, no more war\". A small group of mobilized and determined women morphed into a national movement that in turn translated into a groundswell of support for a female presidential candidate and culminated in the election of Mrs. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf as President, in 2005.  Today, women's community peace huts in counties around the country are venues for conflict mediation and resolution. They also serve as safe havens for women escaping domestic violence and as counselling centres for survivors of sexual and gender- based violence. In the peace huts, women address child support issues and work with local police to identify suspects who have committed crimes against women, so as to ensure their arrest and interrogation. Women also monitor the early warning signs of conflict and lead peaceful demonstrations on issues that affect their well-being.  Since the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), discussions have revealed many examples of women's effective contribution to conflict prevention, peace processes and peacebuilding in the various regions of the world. Women bear the consequences of conflict and are thus well placed to contribute to solutions. Having reached this realization, our common challenge is to find creative means to institutionalize this role at the national and international levels. Women must be capacitated and strategically positioned to play their rightful role.  Liberia is moving deliberately and purposefully towards the fulfilment of its commitments to women's advancement. There has been a gradual increase in women's presence in leadership and decision-making positions at the central and local Government levels. Gender-responsive policies, strategies and programmes, some of which are mentioned in the Secretary-General's report, are being integrated into all sectors of national action. In 2009, Liberia became one of the first countries to have completed its national action plans for the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). This progress has been made possible through the consistent and much-appreciated support of development partners. All the same, inadequate resources remain a challenge and hindrance to robust implementation.  We are encouraged by the recognition that has been accorded internationally to the modest achievements made by Liberia in its efforts to meaningfully involve women in national governance and to build and utilize their productive capacities, including for the consolidation of peace. Mindful that food security has a conflict preventive dimension, I cannot fail to mention that the Hunger Project's prestigious 2011 Africa Prize for Leadership was awarded a few days ago to the Liberian Minister of Agriculture, Ms. Florence Chenoweth, for her dedication to improving the livelihoods and food security of women farmers in Liberia.  Of course, all recognitions have been crowned by the joint award of the Nobel Peace Prize to three women, two of them Liberians - President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf and Leymah Gbowee - each for her contribution to securing peace in Liberia, strengthening the position and enhancing the influence of women in Liberia. As Liberians, this recognition fills us with pride, even if we realize that it is intended to have impact far beyond Liberia. The message to the global community, in the words of the Nobel Committee, is to \"realize the great potential for democracy and peace that women can represent\".  We are proud and inspired by these accolades, but we realize that there is still a long way to go. The incidence of rape of girls and women is still unacceptable high, and women constitute only 14 per cent of the Liberian legislature. We are humbled when we consider the vastness of the challenges that still lie ahead; the gender inequities that still exist; and the high walls that we still have to scale before female mediators and peace negotiators become normal features of the international peace architecture. We believe that the systematic use of quotas at the national and international levels could help to accelerate progress towards this objective. Affirmative action programmes are also required to give the necessary impetus to our effort to place women centrally in conflict prevention, mediation and peace processes.  Liberia pledges to make more concerted efforts to comply with reporting requirements so as to contribute meaningfully to future reports of the Secretary-General on women and peace and security. The presence of UN-Women in Liberia provides the needed support to national efforts to implement resolution 1325 (2000) and reduce gender inequities. We therefore look forward to continued partnership with UN-Women towards the enhancement of women's empowerment, peacebuilding and sustainable development. It is our hope that, in the not too distant future, the capacities of women will be so fully integrated into the global peace architecture that the focus of debates on conflict prevention and mediation will not be on women's role and participation but simply on the subject matter. ",
    " There is no question that the Security Council has adopted historic resolutions to combat the scourge of conflict-related sexual violence. But the question could be asked: What do those resolutions mean for women right now in Libya? If a Libyan woman had been in this Chamber last December when resolution 1960 (2010) was adopted (see S\/PV.6453), what would it have led her to expect?  In a word, the promise of resolution 1960 (2010) is prevention. Resolution 1960 (2010) is rightly oriented towards deterrence. In that respect, it marks a political commitment to bringing all of the Council's tools to bear in preventing and addressing the atrocity of wartime rape. It sets out the elements of an accountability regime aimed at influencing the conduct of perpetrators and would-be perpetrators.  Yet resolutions 1970 (2011) and 1973 (2011) on Libya make no mention of the risk of sexual violence, a risk that is all too real in contexts of escalating unrest and mass displacement. In its preambular part, resolution 1970 (2011) lists a range of human rights concerns - arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, torture, summary execution, forced refugee flight and repression of peaceful demonstrations. Experience attests to the fact that such conditions often signal spikes in sexual violence. However, when it is not explicitly included in mandates and the related political discussions, the question is unlikely to be asked.  Leveraging the credible threat of consequences for rape can make a difference. Resolution 1970 (2011) was thus an opportunity for the Council to raise a red flag, to give effect to the intention expressed so powerfully last December. Sexual violence has emerged despite the robust action of the international community to protect civilians in Libya. Although reports of rape remain unconfirmed - and are even brutally silenced - they have arrested the attention of the world. The name of Eman al-Obeidi is known to all. Reports from transit camps on the Libya-Tunisia border and from surgeons, doctors and international media representatives suggest that it is not plausible to consider her case an isolated incident.  As a political or security situation deteriorates, events unfold rapidly, and sexual violence often becomes part of the repertoire of repression. Its inclusion in peacekeeping and other Chapter VII resolutions sends a strong signal that sexual violence, like other grave violations, will be subject to scrutiny. It tells the women of Libya, cote d'Ivoire or the Democratic Republic of the Congo that the promise of resolution 1960 (2010) will be translated into practice, that thematic resolutions are in fact a prelude to country-level action.  Given the way sexual violence spans the history of war, it should be automatically and systematically included in protection measures. The Council has recognized that sexual violence is used by political and military leaders to advance political, military and economic ends. As a consequence, it warrants continuous consideration. Otherwise, interventions on the front lines may relegate women's security to the sidelines. If we allow the lack of hard data to justify inaction, it will always be too late.  But I am optimistic that resolution 1960 (2010) will shift the terms of the debate from reacting to sexual violence like any other tragedy to preventing sexual violence like any other threat. Indeed, when resolution 1975 (2011), imposing targeted sanctions in response to the surging violence in care d'Ivoire, was adopted on 30 March, sexual violence was duly mentioned (see S\/PV.6508). That was an encouraging sign that such violence is taken seriously and is increasingly being integrated into the Council's core business.  Shocking reports of sexual violence have emerged as part of the post-electoral crisis in cote d'Ivoire. Preliminary information suggests that sexual assaults may have been politically targeted, as previously witnessed in Kenya and Guinea. These incidents demand a swift and thorough investigation. They should also be taken into account when the 11-29982 Council considers the mandate of the United Nations Operation in cote d'Ivoire in the coming weeks.  Council members will recall that resolution 1820 (2008) demands, in paragraph 2, \"the immediate and complete cessation by all parties to armed conflict of all acts of sexual violence against civilians\" and stresses the exclusion of such crimes from amnesty provisions. Accordingly, I urge the Council to use its influence to ensure that any ceasefire agreement reached in relation to Libya or cote d'Ivoire also entails the cessation of sexual violence as a tactic of war. Moreover, commissions of inquiry must include dedicated expertise on this issue.  Almost daily, cases of sexual violence against vulnerable communities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continue to be reported. On 31 December 2010 and 1 January 2011, 47 women were raped in the villages of Bushani and Kalambahiro in Masisi territory in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. The perpetrators were alleged to be Forces armees de la Republique democratique du Congo (FARDC) (ex-Congres national pour la defense du people) soldiers participating in a joint operation of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) and the FARDC.  Yet the past several months have also shown that where there is political will, there is a way. The Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo ensured a swift and open investigation into the rapes that occurred in Fizi territory in December 2010, which led to the trial and conviction by the Military Court in Baraka of Lieutenant Colonel Mutware Kibibi and 10 other FARDC officers. Those perpetrators will serve sentences of between 10 and 20 years. Further, in February, Callixte Mbarushimana, affiliated with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, was transferred from France to the International Criminal Court in The Hague.  While these are exemplary actions, it is essential that all perpetrators be consistently and relentlessly pursued. That will raise the cost of committing, commanding or condoning sexual violence and thereby serve as a deterrent to others.  In February, I visited the Democratic Republic of the Congo for the third time and was able to discuss the issue of impunity with President Kabila and senior members of the Government. The President acknowledged the importance of ensuring the rigorous 11-29982  investigation and prosecution of perpetrators as a key element of prevention. There seems to be a new awareness among the political leadership in this regard. There is also a new trend of convictions of senior FARDC officers - including commanders - for crimes of sexual violence. In March, we witnessed the prosecution of General Jerome Kakwavu, the highest- ranking national army officer ever to be tried for crimes of sexual violence. He was, as members know, one of the five officers blacklisted by this Council.  These are positive signs that I hope can be sustained and reinforced. Since the mass rapes in Walikale, there has also been a marked evolution in MONUSCO's protection response, including the initiation of community alert networks for early warning.  In February, I also visited Kamako in Western Kasai province on the border of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola to look into reports of sexual violence against Congolese women and girls in the context of ongoing expulsions from Angola. Local administrators and United Nations agencies recorded 185 such rapes in January. I met with nearly 70 of these women and girls in Kamako. One woman described having been abducted while at market and raped repeatedly by multiple assailants over the course of several days before being expelled from Angolan territory. I saw the rope burns on the arms of a woman who said that she had been gang-raped and tied to a tree. Many of the women said that they were desperate to find their children, who had remained in Angola after their expulsions. Angolan security forces were implicated in many of these cases.  I then visited Angola from 10 to 14 March to take this issue up with the authorities. I travelled to Lunda Norte province on the Angola-Democratic Republic of the Congo border, where I visited the Chissanda border crossing and the Cajamba refugee settlement. Serious and legitimate concerns exist regarding sexual violence against Congolese women and girls in the context of illegal diamond-mining activities and expulsions. Women are acutely vulnerable in this context. They are in the minority of illegal migrants and at risk of rape and sexual intimidation by armed and uniformed men. There are also concerns of the trafficking of women and girls from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to diamond-mining areas for prostitution and forced labour. 3 The visit resulted in a joint communique of the Government of Angola and the United Nations, outlining a proactive approach to putting in place prevention measures. The Angolan authorities make specific commitments, which include reiterating through the police and army chains of command the orders prohibiting sexual abuse; reinforcing the commitment to zero tolerance of such violations in army and police codes of conduct; undertaking investigations of alleged violations on the basis of credible information, and ensuring punishment of perpetrators; and facilitating the assessment missions of the United Nations and the International Organization for Migration to areas of concern, and granting United Nations protection actors regular access to detention centres or similar locations.  In practical terms, it is essential that the previously established Angola-Democratic Republic of the Congo Mixed Commission be invigorated as the formal framework under which cross-border concerns related to illegal migration are addressed. The Mixed Commission should function at both the national and the provincial levels, and focus particular attention on the vulnerability of women and girls. Regular information exchange and coordination between the United Nations presence in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo is imperative. Once again, this reflects the prevention approach envisioned by resolution 1960 (2010), and affirms that practical solutions are possible.  Cross-border and regional-level cooperation is critical to addressing a problem that often carries regional implications. It is in this context that I have prioritized strategic engagement with the African Union (AU). On 28 March, I addressed the African Union Peace and Security Council on the occasion of its open session on women and children in armed conflict. The AU Peace and Security Council adopted a communique that emphasizes a joint African Union- United Nations response to conflict-related sexual violence, and stresses in particular the need to investigate crimes committed against women and children, launch preventive campaigns aimed at the armed forces and the police, and ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice. The African Union Peace and Security Council also expressed support for the decision of the Chairperson of the AU Commission to appoint an African Union special representative on women, peace and security. Cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union can be enhanced in a number of areas, such as the training of peacekeepers and ensuring that sexual violence concerns are consistently reflected in United Nations and AU-led mediation and conflict- resolution processes. The Security Council and the African Union Peace and Security Council should consider the inclusion of sexual violence as an agenda item in future meetings.  My Office is looking at the issue of sexual violence with a wide range of partners and from all angles, including from the ground up. Last week, I attended a workshop in India at which we discussed the practical challenges facing peacekeepers on the frontlines. For these peacekeepers, sexual violence mandates are operational, not just aspirational. We must give them the financial and political support and all the tools they need to succeed. In this respect, my Office has collaborated with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and UN Women to develop innovative, scenario-based training resources, which have also been piloted in Bangladesh. My interactions with troop-contributing countries affirm that addressing sexual violence is recognized as a core protection of civilians challenge.  My Office is also developing a number of tools to accelerate the implementation of resolution 1960 (2010). These include establishing monitoring, analysis and reporting arrangements for improved information- flow; compiling a matrix of early warning signs to help field personnel predict spikes in sexual violence; and building an accountability regime with real-world impact on the fight against impunity.  Better data is not an end in itself, but serves to inform better responses. We anticipate that guidance to the field on the implementation of resolution 1960 (2010) will be disseminated by the end of May. This will include an operational concept and terms of reference for women protection advisers. It is envisioned that women protection advisers will advise senior United Nations leadership on the implementation of key aspects of the women, peace and security resolutions. As part of our efforts to enhance accountability, at the end of May I hope to brief the Democratic Republic of the Congo Sanctions Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004). My Office also remains at the disposal of the Council as it prepares the terms of reference for its next visit to Africa.  The Team of Experts on the Rule of Law is up and running and due to be deployed to Liberia later this month to support Criminal Court \"E\", which was specifically established to hear cases of sexual violence. The Team will then visit the Democratic Republic of the Congo in May to reinforce the capacity of investigators and prosecutors through prosecution support cells in North and South Kivu, and to mentor women magistrates who have been trained to handle cases of sexual violence. It will also deploy to Southern Sudan in May in order to contribute to the development of new legal frameworks.  War is a context of lethal violence. In such an environment, it is tempting to see sexual violence as a lesser evil. That is not how women see it. That is not the experience of a rape camp survivor from Bosnia who told me: \"They have taken my life without killing me\", or of the woman from Liberia who described rape as \"a kind of slow murder\". Sexual violence maims the survivor not only physically but psychologically and socially as well, turning victims into outcasts. And yet this war tactic requires no weapon greater than an individual's cruel intent. As one Indian peacekeeper so 11-29982 aptly stated last week: \"A rape is an irreversible violation\". We cannot reverse the irreversible, but we can reinforce efforts to prevent and prosecute.  In that respect, resolution 1960 (2010) is seen by many women as a message of hope. One woman I met in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo in March grabbed my hand as I was leaving the meeting and said, \"The fact that you have come all the way from New York means we are not alone after all\". So even in the tyranny of emergency, before hard evidence emerges, and though it may not be obvious what gender has to do with arms embargoes or no-fly zones, we must remember women. Our endeavours to uphold international security will not be comprehensive unless they include efforts to end sexual violence before it has begun.  ",
    " I thank the presidency of Nigeria for organizing this important event. I also commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Under- Secretary-General Michelle Bachelet, Executive Director of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, and other speakers on women and peace and security on their insightful statements.  Eleven years ago, the Security Council adopted the landmark resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security. Bangladesh, a member of the Council at that time and one of the core sponsors of the resolution, was closely associated with the adoption of that historic document, which endeavours to ensure women's rights and roles in peace and security. The decisions adopted in the document apply not only to States, but also to actors involved in the post-conflict peace process. We take a modicum of pride in what we did a decade ago.  Thereafter, several resolutions, such as resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009), 1889 (2009) and 1960 (2010), have been adopted to buttress the process initiated in resolution 1325 (2000). We are, however, disappointed to note that violence against women and girls continues, as detailed in various reports. As we have mentioned in the past, women and girls suffer most as victims of conflict, while in the peace process they are mostly deprived of the dividends. Therefore, the onus lies on us to ensure that the oppression of women and girls, particularly that based on gender, is stopped forever.  We are well aware that poverty, the struggle for scarce resources, and socio-economic injustice and unfairness lie at the heart of conflicts, and that all of them sadly create breeding grounds for social blights, including violence against women and girls. The resulting impact not only leads to insecurity for women and girls, but also impairs political and economic stability, as well as national security. Therefore, protecting women's rights is not an option, but an  obligation that requires coordinated action from all of us.  We recognize that empowering women will lead to their taking command of resources and acquiring adequate leadership capabilities for the efficient management of those resources. Therefore, we emphasize the fulfilment of women's economic needs and the necessity of their engagement internationally at all levels and in all forms of decision-making.  While the former could be achieved by ensuring women's access to and participation in income- generating and entrepreneurial activities, such as micro-credit, education, vocational training and public health, the latter could be ensured through the recruitment of women, particularly to senior positions. In order to more clearly understand the needs of the women of the South, we must ensure that women from the global South get due recognition in the consideration of such recruitment. For proper coordination with the field, the fair representation of troop- and police-contributing countries must be ensured, as decided previously by the General Assembly and the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations of the United Nations.  We believe that women's participation can be ensured through an inclusive process. At the policy level, this requires the creation of a mechanism to integrate women into decision-making processes, which should be supported by the necessary capacity- building initiatives at the community level that would enable women to effectively participate. We strongly believe that our debates and discussions, instead of being confined to our respective capitals, should transcend borders and reach women at the grass-roots level, women who may sometimes be unable even to find the words to express their agony. This has to be done by empowering the people, especially women, at the grass-roots level. If we fail to do so, our progress will be slow.  In Bangladesh, through our experience of nation- building and women's empowerment, we have embraced that view and developed what our Prime Minister, Her Excellency Sheikh Hasina, calls a peace model. The central message of the model is to empower people, including women and vulnerable groups, by providing them with an education and helping them to build their skills, by ensuring that they exercise their right to vote and participate in governance, by raising their income level, by ending poverty and hunger and by eliminating all forms of discrimination and terrorism. In her address to the General Assembly (see A\/66\/PV.22), the Prime Minister of Bangladesh presented her model to the world community, as she is convinced that if peace is attained, development and prosperity will follow. We would be happy to share our experiences with interested delegates.  In Bangladesh, women occupy the top political leadership posts in the country. The Constitution of Bangladesh guarantees the equality of men and women within the broad framework of non-discrimination on the grounds of religion, race or gender. The Government has adopted a national policy for women's advancement and a national plan of action. A women's development implementation committee, headed by the Minister for Women's and Children's Affairs, monitors the implementation of policies for women's empowerment. It has also introduced gender-based budgeting. The results have been highly positive. To cite just one example, the enrolment of girls in both primary and secondary level schools exceeds that of boys, helped by tuition waivers and the provision of stipends for girls in secondary schools.  The Government has enacted laws to protect women against domestic violence and is currently implementing a number of projects to develop the capabilities of women. Many affirmative actions have been taken that help women in distress and elderly women. In order to involve women in decision-making processes, the Government has adopted a quota system for women in the national Parliament and in the recruitment of our civil service officers, in addition to direct elections and open competitions.  In the maintenance of international peace and security, we take pride in our modest contribution of troops and police forces to United Nations peacekeeping missions. The recruitment of women to the police forces and the military amply demonstrates our commitment to women's empowerment in both the national and the international arenas. We are pleased that we were able to deploy a full contingent - an all- female formed police unit - to the friendly country of Haiti following the devastating earthquake there.  I am pleased to report that our all-male troop contingents are fully briefed on gender issues. We provide the necessary on-the-job training to reinforce  their understanding and sensitivity in that regard. We are aware that we need to mainstream a gender perspective into all conflict prevention activities and strategies, develop effective gender-sensitive early warning mechanisms and institutions and strengthen efforts to prevent violence against women, including various forms of gender-based violence.  In conclusion, I would reiterate that we in Bangladesh have been making our best efforts to ensure women's empowerment and participation in all spheres of life, as we believe that educating a boy means educating a person, while in contrast, educating a girl means educating a family. We are willing to replicate any good practices that we come across globally in our national policy and are similarly ready to share our relevant experience with others for the good of humankind.  ",
    " Thank you, Madam President, for holding this important open debate on women, peace and security. I would like to thank Michelle Bachelet, Lazarous Kapambwe and Orzala Ashraf Nemat for their briefings this morning.  I would also particularly like to thank the Secretary-General for the personal interest that he has shown in this very important agenda item. Though we support the comprehensive draft presidential statement that will be adopted in this debate, I regret that because of the opposition of some, we were unable to unreservedly welcome the Secretary-General's report (S\/2011\/598*). The United Kingdom does, wholeheartedly, welcome that report.  Women have a central role in building stability in countries at risk of conflict. Despite our collective efforts, they remain underrepresented in peace processes, in work to detect early signs of conflict, and in mediation between warring parties. Some progress has been made, but it is not until the participation of women is included throughout the conflict cycle that a durable and sustainable peace can be assured.  The Council, of course, may not be the best model. With five female Permanent and Deputy Permanent Representatives leaving the Council at the end of this year, there may be only two female Permanent and Deputy Permanent Representatives around this table, both from the United States.  I have three points to make in today's debate. The first concerns support for the role of UN-Women and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on  ll-56959 Sexual Violence in Conflict; the second addresses the need to do more on conflict prevention and early warning; and the third stresses the work that the United Kingdom has taken forward through our national action plan on women, peace and security.  Since taking up her position as Under-Secretary- General and Executive Director of UN-Women, Michelle Bachelet has passionately and effectively promoted the women, peace and security agenda. Supported by Special Representatives Radhika Coomaraswamy and Margot Wallstrom, UN-Women plays a vital role coordinating wider international efforts to implement the full suite of United Nations resolutions on women, peace and security. We commend in particular, the efforts to improve systematic reporting of progress through the development of indicators and a strategic framework, including the strategic framework of United Nations Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict. In July, the United Kingdom pledged $16 million over a two-year period to UN-Women to support this important work.  We have a responsibility to use all the means available to the United Nations to prevent conflict or relapse into conflict. United Nations Member States must be prepared to invest early to support countries emerging from conflict and react rapidly should a crisis arise. We must also continue to encourage the development and deployment, at the invitation of Governments, of United Nations mediation specialists and special envoys. The United Kingdom welcomes the Secretary-General's call to increase the number of senior female mediators.  I would like now to say a word on national action plans. The United Kingdom believes that national action plans provide an important opportunity for Member States to make their own commitments to reducing the impact of conflict on women and girls and to promoting their inclusion in conflict resolution. Over the past year, the United Kingdom has supported global efforts to implement resolution 1325 (2000). In Afghanistan, the United Kingdom has funded a full range of measures undertaken by the Criminal Justice Task Force to minimize gender-related barriers to working in a high-profile law enforcement environment. We also supported the efforts of the Government of Nepal to develop its own national action plan to generate, among many other things, work to provide support for women and girls who have been the victims of sexual violence. We encourage  more countries to develop national action plans in order to strengthen the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and associated resolutions.  The Arab Spring has shown that threats to security, and to women and girls in particular, are changing constantly. In our work on women and peace and security, we must be flexible enough to respond to new threats and challenges as they emerge. There are sweeping and positive social and economic trends at work. The Council needs to show that we are responsive to those trends. On this as on other issues, we should demonstrate that we are on the right side of history. In particular, we must ensure that governing structures that emerge in the aftermath of conflict do not undermine women's roles and participation in society, and that the same opportunities are available to men and women.  The United Kingdom believes that women's inclusion in political settlements and peace processes, the protection of women and girls in situations of armed violence, and women's access to security and justice are essential building blocks for more peaceful and stable societies.  In a year when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to three impressive women, we share the hope of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that together we can realize the great potential for democracy and peace that women represent.

    " I would like to begin by commending you, Madam President, for convening this debate. It allows Member States to reaffirm their commitment to implementing Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), to assess progress, exchange views and develop new approaches to such an important issue. Our appreciation also goes to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, to Ms. Michelle Bachelet, Executive Director of UN-Women, to the President of the Economic and Social Council and to the representative of the NGO Working Group for their thoughtful insights into today's topic.  While Ukraine aligns itself with the statement by the delegation of the European Union, I will make few brief points in my national capacity.  The eleventh anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000) is an opportunity to strengthen the global agenda on women and peace and security. We welcome the latest report of the Secretary-General on this issue (S\/201l\/598*) and take positive note of its recommendations. My country remains fully committed to the implementation of resolutions 1325 (2000), 1820 (2008) and 1888 (2009). Ukraine considers that ensuring gender equality, gender mainstreaming and the empowerment of women is not only an important objective, but is also an essential part of the pursuit of democracy and development. This year's awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to three distinguished and inspirational women is an acknowledgement of the crucial role of women as defenders of human rights and contributors to political settlements, conflict resolution, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. In recognition of the essential contribution of women towards achieving those objectives, Ukraine co-sponsored a draft resolution on women and political participation.  Despite all international efforts, women and girls continue to be the most vulnerable victims of armed conflicts, targeted with sexual violence, sexual exploitation and other forms of gender-based violence. Eliminating impunity is critical for preventing gender- based crimes. In 2010 Ukraine became a co-sponsor of Council resolution 1960 (2010), which concerned sexual violence in armed conflict. We remain ready to undertake further steps, in particular as a member of UN-Women.  Ukraine recognizes the instrumental role that a stronger United Nations gender architecture could play in advancing women's rights. It is a great responsibility for my country to be represented on the Executive Board of UN-Women. Ukraine's activity in this entity is focused on implementing policies and practices that seek to reduce gender inequality in all its manifestations in every sphere of life, including decision-making and leadership, the elimination of violence against women and girls, and trafficking in women and girls.  We welcome the Council's efforts to pay special attention to the concrete needs of women and girls affected by armed conflicts in such spheres as health, education, legal support, and water and sanitation.  The focus of today's debate on the participation and role of women in conflict prevention and mediation could not be more timely. Ukraine has always stressed the need for the widest possible use of the potential of women in the spheres of preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. We believe that there is still much to be done to redress the current underrepresentation of women in decision- making with regard to conflict resolution so as to make their voice heard loud and clear in peace negotiations. 11-57075  In that context, we welcome the adoption of the first-ever resolution on \"Strengthening the role of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes and conflict prevention and resolution\" (General Assembly resolution 65\/283). In that document, all Member States resolved to promote the equal, full and effective participation of women at all levels of the peaceful settlement of disputes, conflict prevention and resolution, as well as to provide adequate gender expertise for all mediators and their teams.  My delegation prides itself on the long record of participation of Ukrainian women, as civilian police and military observers, in United Nations peacekeeping efforts. Currently, they are deployed in five United Nations peacekeeping operations - in Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, South Sudan and Timor-Leste. Their dedicated service to peace is one of the concrete ways in which Ukraine contributes to advancing the agenda of today's meeting on the ground.  The importance of women's participation in peacebuilding can hardly be overestimated. The issue is one of the priorities of Ukraine as a member of the Organizational Committee of the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) and one of it current Vice-Chairs. We see a great deal of merit in strengthening collaboration between the PBC and UN-Women in this field. From that perspective, Ukraine was one of the initiators of the first-ever joint high-level meeting of those bodies aimed at promoting advocacy for women's participation in peacebuilding, in line with the Secretary-General's thematic report.  In conclusion, Ukraine calls on Member States to renew their commitments under resolution 1325 (2000) and to launch new strategies to address gender equality issues in peace and security processes. Ukraine is resolved to do its share.  ",
    " China appreciates the efforts of Nigeria to convene today's open debate. I wish to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his statement. I also listened carefully to the statements by Madam Bachelet, Executive Director of UN-Women, Ambassador Kapambwe, Permanent Representative of Zambia and President of the Economic and Social Council, and Ms. Nemat of the NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security.  Women are vulnerable in conflict situations and therefore require special attention. Women can make unique contributions to the maintenance of international peace and security, and their potentials must be further tapped. The Security Council's adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) was important progress in the efforts of the international community to protect women's rights and interests. However, there remains a lot to do in comprehensively implementing that resolution. I wish to emphasize four points.  First, to avoid and reduce the harm suffered by women in armed conflict, it is first necessary to prevent war and reduce conflicts. The Security Council bears the primary responsibility of maintaining international peace and security. To safeguard women's rights and interests, the Council should conduct active preventive diplomacy and promote the use of means such as dialogue, consultations and negotiations for the peaceful settlement of disputes. Council resolutions, especially its mandate for civilian protection, should be strictly implemented so as to avoid more casualties among women and children.  Secondly, ensuring the participation of women in conflict resolution and prevention and in rehabilitation and reconstruction is an important part of the efforts to implement resolution 1325 (2000). China supports a bigger role for women in good offices and dispute mediation. We hope the Secretary-General will appoint more female special representatives and special envoys, and we hope to see greater participation by women in United Nations good offices and mediation concerning major international and regional hotspots.  Thirdly, in conflict resolution and post-conflict reconstruction, the national ownership of the government and people concerned must be respected. The international community can provide constructive help, but it must adhere to the United Nations Charter and the principle of non-interference in internal affairs. In safeguarding the rights and interests of women and enhancing their role in peace and security, specific national conditions and historical and cultural differences must be fully taken into account. A uniform approach is not desirable.  Fourthly, in advancing the agenda of women, peace and security, the relevant United Nations organs should collaborate while working in their respective spheres of competence. The Council should, in accordance with its Charter mandate, focus its attention on situations that threaten international peace and security. At the same time, the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) also requires organs such as the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the Human Rights Council to fully play their roles. China appreciates the leading role of UN-Women and looks forward to its greater contribution to the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  ",
    " I thank you, Madam President, for having organized today's debate. I also thank the Secretary-General, Ms. Bachelet, Mr. Kapambwe and Ms. Nemat for their insightfiil remarks.  Germany aligns itself with the statement to be made by Head of the Delegation of the European Union.  As a member of the Group of Friends of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), Germany has always attached great importance to all aspects of the issue of women and peace and security, and particularly to that of turning words into action, 10 years after the adoption of that groundbreaking resolution. We therefore applaud the timely decision of the Nobel Prize Committee to honour three courageous and inspirational women who are exemplary models of how women can make a difference.  Germany heartily welcomes the Secretary- General's comprehensive report (S\/2011\/598*) and the analysis and recommendations it contains, including the strategic framework and the first set of indicators set out.  The draft presidential statement to be adopted today once again clearly recognizes women's significant role in prevention, conflict resolution and post-conflict rebuilding. Including women in peace initiatives is not a benevolent act; we see it as a key requirement for any lasting, sustainable peace. Women's participation will strengthen our capacity to resolve conflict and to build security and justice systems that protect the human rights of all. However, gaps still exist between stated commitments and the situation on the ground. Women remain severely underrepresented in peace negotiations and are often marginalized in efforts to build sustainable peace.  What can be done to close this gap? First, at the United Nations level, we commend UN-Women for its work in leading mainstreaming efforts to include, wherever possible, a gender perspective in United Nations activities, and in measuring progress made in implementing resolution 1325 (2000) against the indicators. It is crucial to constantly strive to place more women in leading positions, including within the United Nations, and to give women a voice during every stage of a peace process. There is a clear link between women's participation in the early stages of preventive diplomacy, peacemaking or peacebuilding and their presence in implementation mechanisms.  Secondly, at the level of the European Union and NATO, both within the European Common Foreign and Security Policy and NATO, the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) in relation to conflict resolution has progressed. Forces are better informed on gender issues, and we are beginning to see the benefits of a new awareness and understanding where it matters - in the communities where soldiers are deployed. Female military medical staff serving in field hospitals lower the barriers to local women seeking treatment and female soldiers gaining better access to local women. Thirdly, with regard to the national level, last year the German Government presented its third report to Parliament on its implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). It contains, inter alia, projects on gender training, including for United Nations peacekeepers, the prevention of sexual violence, and enabling women's participation in peace processes and their unhindered access to justice. A special focus is on support for women's organizations and non-governmental organizations in promoting women's empowerment.  In addition, the German Government has set up action plans on gender in development aid programmes and on civilian crisis prevention. Germany implements the indicators adopted by the European Union in 2010.  Fourthly and last, the Security Council could do more to systematically integrate women, peace and security issues into its daily work, including when mandating or renewing United Nations missions. Envoys and special representatives should address those issues, where relevant, in their briefings to the Council.  I would like to conclude by expressing Germany's support for the draft presidential statement to be adopted today.  ",
    " Spain welcomes today's thematic debate on women and peace and security, and specifically on sexual violence in conflict, which is a priority issue for my Government. We appreciate the presidency of Togo's initiative in holding this debate, and we hope that the Council will continue addressing the issue regularly.  We also thank the Secretary-General for his report on Conflict-related sexual violence (S\/20l2\/33) and the Special Representative of the Secretary- General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Ms. Wallstrom, for her briefing. We endorse the recommendations in the report and we fully support the work and mandate of the Special Representative, as established in resolutions 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010), as well as that of the Group of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict.  Spain associates itself with the statement made by the observer of the European Union. I will only make some brief observations in my national capacity.  In recent months, in application of Spain's national action plan on resolution 1325 (2000) and other associated resolutions, we have engaged in several activities, especially in the area of training, that  I wish to highlight. We are firmly convinced that training is an essential aspect of our efforts to prevent sexual violence in conflict.  First, last November the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation and the Ministry of Defence organized, together with the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Defence of the Netherlands, the second offering of the international pilot course on the gender perspective in peacekeeping operations, which took place in The Hague. The purpose of the seminars is to promote the inclusion of the gender perspective in all peacebuilding activities and to ensure specific training of personnel participating in those missions. We plan to continue to offer the courses every six months, alternating between the Netherlands and Spain.  Moreover, in order to raise the profile of gender advisers and ensure the inclusion of the gender perspective in peacekeeping missions, the Ministry of Defence of Spain organized a course in late October 2011 on the gender perspective in operations, with conferences for members of the armed forces on equal opportunity, setting norms on gender issues, and the fight against rape and sexual violence in conflict.  The next course for high officials in peacekeeping operations, to be organized in coordination with the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations and held in May in Kigali, Rwanda, will deal specifically with the issue before us today, with particular emphasis on the fight against sexual violence in conflict.  My Government is currently conducting its third review of the national action plan on women and peace and security, incorporating the recommendations contained in the Secretary-General's reports and in the resolutions, statements and decisions of the Security Council, especially those relating to sexual violence in conflict. My delegation welcomes the fact that the members of the Security Council have also been able to reach agreement on this important issue.  Finally, I again thank the Special Representative for her words and for her work. We hope that her work and the work of her Team of Experts, together with UN-Women, in cooperation with all other actors, will help to cement the commitments needed to finally put an end to sexual violence in conflict. We hope that the Council will continue to regularly invite the Special Representative to provide updated information on the progress of her important mandate. ",
    " At the outset, I would like to thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Margot Wallstrom, for her comprehensive and valuable briefing and for the report  of the Secretary-General on conflict-related sexual violence (S\/2012\/33). We welcome the efforts of the Special Representative and share the principles and objectives she outlined. I would also like to thank the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, Mr. Ladsous, and the representative of the NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security, Ms. Megheirbi. We think the deliberations today will promote our common interest in the subject.  India has been actively participating in the Council's debates on the agenda item on women and peace and security. It is a cross-cutting issue with a multisectoral dimension and requires the active participation of all Member States. I would therefore like to thank you, Mr. President, and the delegation of Togo for organizing this open debate, which affords Member States an opportunity to discuss the progress made in the implementation of Security Council resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010) and contributes to our ongoing consideration of the subject.  It is estimated that today close to 90 per cent of current casualties in wars and situations of armed conflict are civilians, the majority of whom are women and children. Obviously, women bear a disproportionately large share of the burden of conflict, but they have only a marginal say in matters of war and peace. That is perhaps a function of the gender imbalance in our societies, which is reflected in positions of power and influence.  Despite that, women should not be Viewed solely as victims of war. They also have to assume the key role of ensuring family livelihoods in the midst of chaos and destruction. They are particularly active in peace movements at the grass-roots level and in cultivating peace within their communities. Therefore, the absence of women at the peace-negotiating table is unconscionable. Some of the aspects highlighted by the landmark Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) - in particular the greater participation of women in areas of conflict prevention, peace negotiation and post-conflict reconstruction - are central to the issue.  Some solutions need to emerge from the conflict- affected societies themselves. Others are more long-term and structural, involving, inter alia, the encouragement of democratic ideals and practices, effective improvements in economic and social conditions and  12-2393] expansion of opportunities for education and productive employment.  Situations of conflict vary. Each has its own causes and consequences. Clearly, there can be no off-the-shelf remedies or panaceas. We need to take practical and effective steps to mitigate the impact of conflict on women and to enhance their ability to restore and preserve peace.  It is a matter of deep regret that the international community must repeatedly debate the issue of sexual and other forms of violence against women and girls in situations of armed conflict. That abhorrent behaviour, whether perpetrated by the parties to the armed conflict or by others, must be unequivocally, unambiguously and resolutely condemned. There should be no tolerance for gender-based violence. All such cases must be investigated and the perpetrators prosecuted.  Some argue that human rights law and international humanitarian law do not offer enough protection to women and children. Such postulation is a bit extreme. Women's rights and needs have received the attention they deserve in the codification of international law. The challenge is the effective implementation of the laws and the availability of adequate resources for capacity-building wherever required. That alone will ensure the real impact of our efforts on the ground.  By definition, it is States that are parties to the treaty-based system of international law. By and large, they respect them, and when they do not, penalties arise under provisions of the relevant treaties. However, the most egregious crimes against women in times of conflict have been and are being committed by non-State actors, often warring against Governments. They obey no laws and, as experience has shown throughout the past decade, are immune to coercive or punitive measures. The Council therefore needs to consider, in practical terms, how non-State actors, who are responsible for the bulk of the crimes that continue to be committed against women, can be effectively tackled.  On the part of the United Nations, there has been modest progress in areas such as gender mainstreaming in peacekeeping operations and training of peacekeeping personnel on gender perspectives. In that context, we commend Special Representative Wallstrom for having brought a new synergy in addressing the issue of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict.  12-2393]  My country has taken a lead in that process, while conscious of the need to incorporate essential elements of the gender-mainstreaming policy in the predeployment training of its peacekeepers. India's formed police unit (FPU) of 100 personnel in Liberia was the first of its kind among United Nations peacekeeping operations. As the largest troop- contributing country in United Nations history, we are very proud of the exemplary record of our peacekeepers. I might add that we are willing to increase our contribution of female FPUs.  The Secretary-General, in his report, referred to efforts to establish a framework of early warning indicators specific to conflict-related sexual violence. The United Nations has also developed a set of indicators as global markers of progress in the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). We have taken note of those efforts. The development of such indicators, benchmarks and guidelines should involve a process of broad intergovernmental scrutiny and approval before their eventual adoption. In that connection, one must be cognizant of the difficulty in obtaining credible and verifiable data from conflict situations.  India will continue to contribute positively to United Nations efforts in protecting vulnerable sectors of the population, particularly women and children, in conflict and post-conflict societies. I would also like to emphasize that the international community needs to enhance cooperation by providing new and additional financial resources, sharing experiences and building capacity in the areas of justice and the rule of law.  The women and children in our lives ensure our future. They must live in security. While there is much talk of the need to safeguard the interests of women and children, there is less talk of cooperative efforts to ensure sustained economic growth, which alone can eradicate the poverty and deprivation that cause their exclusion.  Several studies point out that most of the global poor are women. Globalization has affected both men and women, but women bear the double burden of inequality and marginalization. Empowering them is therefore both crucial and urgent. In considering the role of women in peace and security, the Council, I am certain, will bear in mind the wider perspective of women's empowerment, development and peace.  ",
    " Again, I apologize for asking for the floor. It is curious, to say the least, that the representative of Armenia, the country that bears the primary responsibility for unleashing the war against Azerbaijan and committing other serious international crimes during the conflict, takes the floor in the Security Council and tries to lecture the victim of aggression.  The Government of Armenia, which has purged both the territory of its own country and the occupied areas of Azerbaijan of all non-Armenians, and thus succeeded in creating mono-ethnic cultures there, should be, in our view, the last one to speak on such notions as peace, human rights and the self- determination of peoples.  As far as the reference to the Nagorny Karabakh region of Azerbaijan is concerned, I should recall that the Security Council has recognized that Nagorny Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan and reaffirmed respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability of the international borders of Azerbaijan.  We consider the stance of Armenia as an open challenge to the conflict settlement process and a serious threat to international and regional peace and security.  The earlier the officials of that country  understand the lack of any perspective in their  unconstructive and dangerous political agenda, the  sooner our people will be able to benefit from peace, stability and cooperation.  ",
    " I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Nordic countries - Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and my own country, Sweden. The Nordic countries thank the Secretary- General for his report to the Council (S\/20l2\/33), and his Special Representative Margot Wallstrom for so ably leading the United Nations work in this difficult area. We also thank her, Under-Secretary-General Ladsous and the representative of the NGO Working Group, Amina Megheirbi, for their important statements here today.  The report of the Secretary-General constitutes a baseline and sets a standard for the Council to obtain more systematic, detailed and analytical information on conflict-related sexual violence. That was our hope when, in December 2010, we welcomed the creation of the monitoring, analysis and reporting arrangements. Now as we see progress in reporting, it is also time to improve our response, as Special Representative Wallstrom stated in her remarks earlier today.  We support the Secretary-General's recommendation to the Council to increase pressure on perpetrators through measures by the relevant sanctions committees. We welcome the further development of the monitoring, analysis and reporting mechanism and underline the need to avoid duplication and to ensure coordination with the monitoring and reporting mechanism on children and armed conflict and regular human rights reporting. In that context, we acknowledge the important work undertaken by both the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Sexual Violence in Conflict and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children in Armed Conflict.  We are pleased that Special Representative Wallstrom has been able to address the Council in country-specific meetings throughout her mandate when new information emerged. That type of interaction can allow preventive action to be taken in reasonable time. Timely, analytical and verified information allows a better response at all levels. National Governments and local civil society organizations can more accurately plan and establish effective early warning tools, response and protection mechanisms, as well as services for survivors. United Nations actors and international non-governmental organizations that support them can respond quicker and better. The Security Council can take targeted and consistent action against perpetrators to fight impunity, increase compliance with international law and, ultimately, prevent such crimes from happening in the first place. We encourage the Council to explore ways by which it could enhance and systematize the consideration of information on serious violations being brought to it, as well as to use all possible tools at its disposal to respond.  The Nordic countries have always advocated a broad approach based on equal rights and the participation of both women and men as the best possible prevention tool in the long term. I would like to draw attention to two sectors where institutional reforms are particularly important in combating sexual violence and other serious human rights violations, namely, the security and justice sectors.  It is essential that every process aimed at security sector reform include a focus on sexual violence, as well as the broader security needs of women and girls. Training and capacity-building of national security actors should aim at a real shift in attitudes from a conflict management posture to the provision of security for citizens and communities, placing the person in the centre. When assessing security in the aftermath of a conflict, indicators such as women's movement between villages and children's school attendance should be used alongside the more traditional ones. Proper vetting procedures should be used to exclude perpetrators of sexual violence or other human rights violations from all branches of the security services. More women should be recruited and trained to serve in the security sector, including in leading positions. Specialized units for the reporting of sexual and gender-based violence should be set up, and the security sector should be placed under democratic control and supplied with accountability mechanisms, including accountability to local communities.  In order to incorporate those important aspects in the preparations for peacekeeping missions, all Nordic military and police personnel receive training on resolution 1325 (2000). A joint Nordic Centre for Gender in Military Operations was established last month in Stockholm. The aim of the Centre is to raise the countries' competence in gender issues within planning, execution and evaluation in military operations. The Nordic Centre for Gender in Military Operations will act as a hub for information, knowledge and experiences. The Centre will  continuously support and cooperate with the United Nations, the European Union, NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and other relevant actors. On this note, we particularly welcome the Department of Peacekeeping Operations continuing work on training, as addressed by Under- Secretary-General Ladsous earlier today.  There should never be impunity for sexual violence. We are pleased that the Council has demonstrated increasing willingness to use commissions of inquiry and referrals to the International Criminal Court. International inquiries and high-profile trials serve an important function but, as I mentioned a moment ago, national-level legal and justice sector reforms are at least as important to combat impunity and prevent and deter sexual violence in the long term.  The Nordic countries commend the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law for having in a short time developed a focused way to support Governments in this area. Elsewhere innovative practices such as mobile courts are being used to bring justice closer to the survivors and communities, serving a double- function of justice and confidence building. Enhanced access to justice should also be accompanied by enhanced reparations for victims. Innovative measures such as community reparations and the creation of economic and educational opportunities should be explored more widely.  Finally, the Nordic countries commend the Council and the broader United Nations system for continuing to address conflict-related sexual violence and to use available means to counter those threats against international peace and security. We strongly welcome the soon to be launched guidelines to address sexual violence in ceasefires and peace agreements. There can be no real peace unless there is peace and justice for survivors of sexual violence.  We express again our full support for the work Special Representative of the Secretary-General Wallstrom.  ",
    " I would like to thank you very much, Mr. President, for having convened this debate. The very large number of delegations that have expressed a desire to speak today clearly shows that this issue is at the heart of our concerns. I should also like very much to thank the Special Representative of the Secretary- General and Mr. Ladsous for their briefings, as well as Ms. Amina Megheirbi for her very moving statement. (spoke in English)  Let me start by commending Ms. Margo Wallstrom for her excellent work over the past two  12-2393]  years and her efforts to spread a clear message that sexual violence is simply not tolerable and that there is no real security without women's security.  The report (S\/2012\/33) before us today gives a clear and comprehensive idea of the intensive work that has been carried out worldwide by the Special Representative in her advocacy for the fight against conflict-related sexual violence, in field visits, in engaging with national and non-governmental bodies and authorities and in coordinating within the United Nations system. It provides us with important information on the implementation of the resolutions passed by this Council regarding monitoring and reporting arrangements aimed at collecting more consistent information on conflict-related sexual violence, but also regarding the establishment of a team of experts on the rule of law to assist national authorities to reinforce traditional systems weakened by conflict.  Moreover, the report provides us with very useful information on specific situations, in accordance with resolution 1888 (2009) - information about incidents, but also about challenges and best practices adopted at the national level. It also contains very concrete recommendations, which we welcome.  We must recognize that much has been achieved, and we are confident that the Special Representative will continue to carry out her mandate in the same committed and professional manner.  The Security Council has recognized that the protection of women is a critical priority for peace and security. Resolutions 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010) have clearly established the fight against sexual violence in the agenda of this Council. The Council has created the necessary tools for obtaining reliable and accurate information on sexual violence. A common definition of sexual violence and common methodologies for data collection through monitoring and recording activities are now used throughout the system.  The Council has been quite successful in discharging its responsibilities, but it still needs to reinforce its effectiveness. For instance, we need to make full use of existing tools, mainly ensuring deployment of women's protection advisers in relevant peacekeeping operations, which will strengthen the prevention of and the response to sexual violence. We hope that the challenges that have delayed the deployment of these advisers will be overcome, since their deployment in specific missions has already been requested by this Council.  Another promising tool at the disposal of Member States is the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict. We welcome the technical cooperation that was provided at the request of national authorities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, the Republic of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Cote d'Ivoire.  All information contained in the report is relevant for the Security Council in terms of the Charter's mandate for the maintenance of national peace and security. The information that is already collected by the reporting mechanism will improve the Council's access to timely, objective, accurate and reliable information on sexual Violence in conflict. The Secretary-General or the Special Representative will be able to brief the Council with reliable information on specific situations that deserve the Council's attention. That reliable information will consequently enable the Council to act, collectively and in an appropriate mode, well before major incidents of widespread sexual violence reinforce threats to peace and security.  Indeed, a Council that is better informed is also in a better position to take effective action. With sufficient information, the Council will be able to take preventive steps in a timely manner. But the Council now will also need to take action with regard to those parties listed in the annex of the Secretary-General's report, which are, and I quote, \"credibly suspected of committing or being responsible for patterns of rape and other forms of sexual violence\" (S\/2012\/33, para. 118).  The Council has already passed a clear message to assure the perpetuators of sexual Violence that the Council adopts sanctions against perpetrators who have been identified or who are credibly suspected of committing sexual violence in situations of armed conflict on its agenda. The Council should be consistent and reinforce that message concerning other individuals in similar circumstances. Impunity is simply not acceptable. The work carried out by the Special Representative and, ultimately, by this Council during the past few years is making a real difference in many parts of the world, especially for women and girls, but also for men and boys. As we have heard, Governments  have recently prosecuted senior officers of their armed forces for crimes of sexual violence, and leaders of parties in armed conflict have been arrested and transferred to the International Criminal Court. These actions send a powerful signal to the victims of sexual violence that no military or political leader is above the law. This political message needs to be constantly underlined by the United Nations, and by this Council in particular.  Before concluding, let me mention that we regret that we have not yet been able to agree on the presidential statement on this important debate. But we trust that, with the cooperation of all, we will be able to achieve this shortly.  I conclude with a word for the victims and the survivors of sexual violence. They are at the centre of our debates. Let us not forget them and the fact that beyond bringing perpetrators to justice, the international community also needs to afford care and reparation to the victims.  ",
    " Switzerland thanks the Guatemalan presidency for proposing this discussion, as well as the Indian presidency, which took it up again after Hurricane Sandy. We would also like to thank the Deputy Secretary- General for having presented the report (S\/2012\/732) on the implementation of the strategic framework for the promotion of women and peace and security. The report shows, in our view, the usefulness of the global indicators in measuring progress - or sometimes the lack of progress - in a systematic, transparent, honest and critical way.  Let me first address the main topic of today's open debate, the inclusion of women's civil society networks in the prevention and resolution of armed conflicts and peacebuilding. I will concentrate on three main issues that we believe to be crucial.  First, on mediation, the Secretary-General's report provides us with important facts and figures. Unfortunately, it comes to the conclusion that progress remains limited with regard to the inclusion of women in peace talks and the inclusion of women's issues in peace agreements. Our challenge today is to identify opportunities for their participation and to offer them such opportunities at all levels. There is no shortage of capable and well-trained women, as a number of mediation training events for women and women's networks have taken place all over the world.  In the framework of our programme dedicated to dealing with the past, we have attached great importance to a gender-sensitive implementation of the transitional justice mechanisms. Women's perspectives and needs must be an essential component of all four principles of the fight against impunity: the search for truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence.  On security sector reform, gender-based violence can be rooted in traditional values and norms, stereotypes and structures that are transmitted through education and perpetuated by civil society. These stereotypes, values and norms are mirrored in the security sector, which is also one of the key areas to focus on in the fight against discrimination and gender- based violence. If the security sector is to be effective in fighting impunity for crimes committed against women, it must be reformed, taking into account sexist cliches and patterns of deep-rooted discrimination against women, and by including women's networks in the process.  Allow me to conclude with a quick advertisement. The NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security has prepared a report parallel to the work of the Security Council entitled \"Mapping Women, Peace and Security in the UN Security Council: 2011-2012\". We recently launched the report with Liechtenstein, and we warmly encourage all Council members and the entire United Nations membership to read it and to take into account its recommendations in their daily work.  Finally, I have the pleasure today to announce the launch of another important publication supported by Switzerland and Liechtenstein, the Handbook on Women, Peace and Security, by the NGO Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. It is the second edition of the Handbook and examines the degree to which the Security Council has incorporated women, peace and security into its geographical work over the past 12 years, specifically in the Council's country-specific resolutions. The Handbook also contains important recommendations and is available electronically as a smartphone application so that all can have access at any point to language involving women, peace and security. We encourage all Council members to use the Handbook to better strengthen the links between geographical and thematic work.  IfI may, I would like to distribute a copy of the Handbook to each member of the Council. I know it is lunchtime and I would very much have preferred to provide members with more material sustenance, but I do hope that this intellectual nourishment will also be ofinterest to the Council.

    " Pakistanjoins other Council members in thanking India for convening today's important open debate on women and peace and security. The presidential statement on the subject (S\/PRST\/2012\/23) is an expression of collective support by all Council members for this common cause and of their strong commitment to address challenges to women's engagement at all levels. We would like to place on record our appreciation for the excellent work done by the United Kingdom and Guatemala in developing the presidential statement.  Pakistan attaches highest importance to the participation of women in all walks of life and has taken concrete steps to that end. Our national vision for women's empowerment is guided by the words of our country's founding father, the Quaid-e-Azam, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who said:  \"No nation could ever be worthy of its existence that could not take its women along with the men and no struggle could ever succeed without women participating side by side with men. There are two powers in the world; one is the sword and the other is the pen. There is a great competition and rivalry between the two. There is a third power stronger than both, that of the women\".  In the recent past, Pakistan's parliament has passed a number of laws to eliminate discrimination against women and to promote and protect their rights.  We are thankful to the Deputy Secretary-General for his insights on the subject and for the efforts made by the United Nations, under the Secretary-General's leadership, to mainstream a gender perspective both within and outside the Organization. We also thank Under-Secretary-General Herve Ladsous for his useful briefing on how the United Nations is carrying out the women, peace and security agenda in peacekeeping operations.  As one of the biggest troop contributors, Pakistan supports efforts to mainstream a gender perspective in peacekeeping operations. The appointment of gender advisers in the field has served a useful purpose, and the practice must be strengthened. Conscious of the importance of gender sensitization of peacekeeping troops, Pakistan has incorporated two United Nations standard gender training modules. We are proud of our women peacekeepers, who have served in a variety of capacities such as police officers, doctors and nurses in peacekeeping operations in Asia, Africa and the Balkans. Shahzadi Gulfam, a Pakistani woman police officer, received the 2011 International Female Police Peacekeeper Award in recognition of her outstanding performance in Timor-Leste. We are proud of her meritorious services.  Pakistan is also grateful to Madam Bachelet for her insightful presentation today. We commend the valuable role UN-Women plays in promoting the wider goal of gender equality in general and the women, peace and security agenda in particular. Pakistan will continue to play its part in strengthening UN-Women.  Human rights instruments, particularly the Geneva Conventions, proscribe torture, violence, rape and other forms of sexual violence and ill treatment of women during conflicts. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court characterizes those acts in the context of armed conflict as crimes against humanity. Despite such progress in the normative framework, women's suffering in conflict situations continues. There is growing awareness of their plight and there is increased focus on their protection. Still, women and girls continue to be the primary victims in conflict situations and to suffer disproportionately. To start with, they are vulnerable to violence and exploitation. What is worse, they are purposefully targeted and are largely excluded from the peace and reconstruction processes. Resolution 1325 (2000) made an important contribution to the normative framework for the protection of women and girls in armed conflict. It elevates women from hapless victims of conflict situations to equal stakeholders in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in post-conflict reconstruction.  Women are true agents of change. Their involvement in different stages of conflict resolution and in peacekeeping and peacebuilding activities produces positive results that are needed for peaceful and democratic societies. To enable the Security Council and the United Nations system to do more to advance the protection of women in conflict situations and to enhance their participation in post-conflict processes, we propose the following measures.  First, the United Nations must develop a comprehensive strategy for conflict prevention and resolution, with special emphasis on the protection of women and girls in situations of armed conflict.  Second, the Security Council should continue to strengthen the provisions in its resolutions on full compliance with international humanitarian law and on ending impunity and ensuring accountability for the perpetrators of crimes against women, including in transitional justice mechanisms. The morally unacceptable scourge of gender-based violence persists because a culture of impunity pervades situations of armed conflict.  Third, the Council must continue to include gender perspectives in its resolutions relating to peacekeeping operations and should support the appointment of well- trained gender advisers and women protection advisers.  Fourth, the United Nations and its agencies should develop ways to address the special needs of women and girls affected by armed conflict, especially with regard to health and psychological care.  Fifth, concerned States and the United Nations system must work to ensure the fullest participation of women, including all civil society actors, in peace processes as well as in post-conflict peacebuilding activities. Interaction with local women's groups to get first-hand knowledge of their concerns in conflict situations is always useful.  Sixth, the United Nations system and concerned States must cooperate to build the resources of gender justice in post-conflict situations, incorporating gender perspectives across the broad spectrum of reconstruction efforts. Seventh, the necessary technical assistance must be provided, on request, to concerned States for reforming and rebuilding judicial, legislative and electoral sectors as well as for the economic, social and political empowerment of women within a culturally sensitive framework.  Eighth, the Council must demand from all parties to armed conflicts full respect for and compliance with international humanitarian law and other relevant instruments on the protection of women.  Today's debate underlines the important role of women's civil society organizations in the prevention and resolution of armed conflict and in follow- up peacebuilding processes. Concerned States and relevant United Nations entities should therefore make use of the talent and experience of women leaders from civil society to promote their active engagement and participation in a variety of appropriate roles to ensure the full and effective implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).

    " This year marks the twelfth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security. While the achievements of the past decade have been remarkable, there remain persistent gaps and challenges, including the low level of women's participation in conflict prevention and peacebuilding processes.  We are satisfied that the presidential statement adopted last year (S\/PRST\/2011\/20) gave renewed attention to the issue of the participation and role of women in conflict prevention and mediation. We also welcome the fact that this year's annual report of the Secretary-General (S\/2012\/732) provides us with valuable information on the issue and updates us on the progress in the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  Against that backdrop, I would like to underscore the following four points with regard to the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and women's participation in that regard.  First, my delegation welcomes the growing attention of United Nations human rights mechanisms on women, peace and security issues. We would like to encourage all Member States to cooperate closely with such mechanisms in order to ensure implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) at the national level. As the report of the Secretary-General rightly points out, consistency is crucial in ensuring robust progress on the women, peace and security agenda. We believe that the recommendations of United Nations human rights mechanisms, including treaty bodies and the special procedures of the Human Rights Council, serve as significant tools to ensure consistency in implementing resolution 1325 (2000).  Secondly, we need to pay more attention to the role and participation of women in post-conflict settings. It is regrettable that, of the nine peace agreements signed in 2011, only two contain specific provisions on women, peace and security. That means that we are missing invaluable opportunities to enhance women's political participation and empowerment in transition periods. My delegation notes that temporary special measures, including gender quotas in post-conflict elections, have proved effective in increasing women's representation in decision-making bodies. We believe that serious consideration should be given to such measures in other post-conflict situations.  Thirdly, my delegation would like to underline the crucial role played by women's civil society organizations in conflict resolution and peacebuilding processes. Their special expertise, skills and capacities have been critical to building confidence between parties and to integrating a gender perspective in transition structures. However, women's organizations still face a number of challenges, ranging from few opportunities to participate in formal conflict resolution or political dialogue, poor funding and cultural and social barriers to frequent security threats, which all prevent their long-term planning. In that regard, we welcome the fact that the report of the Secretary-General highlights the importance of the financial sustainability of women's organization, as well as their sufficient representation in the formal peacebuilding discourse.  Fourthly, we should continue to strengthen efforts to prevent and respond to conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence. It is disturbing that there are continuing reports of rape and other forms of sexual violence not only in situations of armed conflict, but in the context of elections, political strife and civil unrest. We support the Secretary-General's recommendation in his report to ensure the gender-responsiveness of transitional justice mechanisms, including targeted outreach to victims, reparation programmes and explicit references to sexual violence, in the mandates of transitional justice actors.  We truly appreciate all the support shown for the Republic of Korea during our successful campaign for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for 2013- 2014. As a staunch supporter of the Council's activities on women, peace and security and as current President of the Executive Board of UN-Women, the Republic of Korea will do its utmost while serving on the Council to address the most pressing issues on women, peace and security.  ",
    " First of all, I would like to thank the Secretary-General, the new Executive Director of UN Women and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for their informative briefings. I also thank and welcome the participation of the representative from civil society. I would also like to welcome today's adoption of resolution 2122 (2013).  As Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe announced in his statement to the General Assembly last month (see A\/68\/PV.12), Japan is actively committed to engaging in the international agenda concerning women and to making every effort to create a society where women shine. We are planning to extend official development aid amounting to more than $3 billion over the next three years in the areas of women's social advancement and capacity-building; women's health care; and women's participation and protection in the field of peace and security.  In order to protect women's rights and ensure women's participation in conflict-affected situations, security for those who serve to uphold the rule of law, such as police officers and judges, is a basic necessity. In that regard, gender-responsive transitional justice measures and justice system reforms need to be addressed. In particular, women's access to the justice system must be strengthened so as to protect their rights, as well as to protect them from the Violence that too often accompanies the transition from conflict. To that end, Japan has, for example, supported various efforts to assist victims of sexual violence in refugee camps located in such countries as the Sudan, Somalia and Iraq, by providing legal advice, representation and awareness-raising campaigns, as well as establishing relief and recovery systems that include mental health care.  In order for Member States and the United Nations system to be able to take effective actions, it is important that we highlight good practices and share lessons learned. Today's open debate is an excellent opportunity to that end.  In order to realize a more peaceful society, Japan intends to make its utmost effort to ensure women's participation and incorporate a women's perspective into each and every phase of conflict prevention, conflict settlement and peacebuilding, including election processes. Such women's participation will also contribute to better protecting the rights and the physical well-being of women, including female human rights defenders, female political leaders and female war correspondents, who are particularly exposed to danger in times of conflict.  From that perspective, Japan has been earnestly developing a national action plan based on resolution 1325 (2000). In that action plan, Japan, in collaboration with UN Women and civil society, will articulate measures to be taken for the sake of promoting women's participation in such efforts as conflict prevention, the protection of victims of sexual violence, and peacebuilding and restoration processes.  In July, in collaboration with the Global Network of Women Peacebuilders, our Mission held a special event entitled \"Resolution 1325 (2000) in action: lessons learned and reflections\". The summary of the discussion held at that event has been included in the Secretary-General's report. We hope that it will further serve as an input to the global review of resolution 1325 (2000) in November.  Increasing investment in the capacity and resources of women's civil society organizations that are active in conflict-affected countries should also be considered. In that regard, Japan was one of the initial supporters, and continues to be one of the main contributors, of the United Nations Trust Fund in Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence against Women, which directly supports such civil society organizations. We will continue our contribution to the Fund. Furthermore, Japan co-hosted a special event in July with the Fund to expand its donor base, including private-sector donors.  In addition, I would like to share with the Council our experience of making use of an area of Japan's official development assistance schemes that we call grant assistance for grassroots projects, which we believe is apositive example ofa good practice that could be emulated elsewhere. Grant assistance for grassroots projects is intended to provide rapid and direct support to both international and local non-governmental organizations active on the ground. Through such assistance, we have been implementing numerous projects on this basis all over the world, including in Afghanistan and several African countries, providing useful synergies for both donor and recipient countries. In conclusion, Japan will continue to make every possible efforts to contribute to the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) as we approach the fifteenth anniversary of its adoption, and will actively participate in its high-level review in 2015.

    " Croatia thanks Azerbaijan for convening this important debate on women, the rule of law and transitional justice in conflict-affected situations, an issue to which Croatia attaches great importance in the context of further advancing the women and peace and security agenda at the global, regional and national levels.  We welcome the report and recommendations of the Secretary-General on women and peace and security (S\/2013\/525), as well as resolution 2122 (2013), adopted today by the Council.  Croatia endorses the statement delivered on behalf of the European Union and would like to add a few points in its national capacity.  In our View, ensuring gender equality is one of the basic principles with regard to respect for human rights. Transitions can present opportunities to strengthen women's rights, leadership and empowerment. It is crucial to put in place gender-responsive transitional justice measures as a key element in the processes of restoring the rule of law and governance systems in any conflict-affected situation.  Women ought to be placed at the heart of ongoing political, social and economic developments. Even though women are widely recognized as effective agents of peace, the number of women participating in decision-making in the area of peace and security remains unacceptably low. Ensuring their equal participation in decision-making is therefore essential for achieving sustainable peace and stability. In that context, we stress in particular the need to increase women's and girls' access to education. There can be no development and stability in any society, in particular war-affected and post-conflict ones, if girls and women have no access to education.  Owing to discriminatory legal frameworks and practices, women and girls are more vulnerable to conflict-related violations of their rights, including sexual violence. It is of Vital importance that the culture of impunity that still prevails with regard to such crimes be addressed. Based on our own tragic experiences of the aggression on Croatia in the 1990s, during which rape was used as a method of intimidation and terror, we are convinced that the issue of sexual violence in conflict can be adequately addressed only through a comprehensive approach. In our View, Victims' rights and access to reparations is one of the most gender- responsive transitional justice measures. The Croatian Government is currently preparing comprehensive legislation by which the survivors of sexual violence from the 1990s will be entitled to the status of civilian Victims of war.  We also welcome the adoption of the resolution 2106 (2013), on strengthening of the prevention and prosecution of conflict-related sexual violence, and support the work of the Special Representative of the Secretary General on Sexual Violence in Conflict. As a member of the group of global champions of the prevention of sexual violence initiative, Croatia will spare no effort to take a more prominent role in preventing and combating sexual violence in conflicts.  Despite all efforts, violence against women and girls still poses serious threats and has no borders or nationality. The recent adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty, with a binding criterion on gender-based violence, contributes to preventing the potential negative impact of international arms transfers on women and their rights. Croatia signed the Treaty in June, and is currently in the process of its ratification.  We believe that greater coordination and synergy amoang international partners would further improve the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) on the ground.  Domestically, through its national action plan for the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), Croatia has integrated a gender perspective into its foreign and security policy as well as its actions. We attach particular importance to the involvement of women in peacekeeping operations. Their presence reinforces women's perspectives, giving their initiatives more added value.  Female members of the Croatian Armed Forces  involved in international assignments actively work as commanders, military observers and staff officers. We are particularly proud to state that, in coordination with NATO, in December we will deploy our first female general as gender adviser to the Commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Kabul. At the regional level, we strongly support the adoption of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe action plan on women, peace and security at the forthcoming ministerial meeting in Kiev.  In September, Croatia, as Chair ofthe Peacebuilding Commission, organized a high-level ministerial event with UN Women on women's economic empowerment for peacebuilding. The main rationale behind this event was to renew commitment and to sharpen the global focus on the role of women as agents of positive change and transformation in countries emerging from conflicts. We also wanted to invite the broader United Nations to boost women's economic rights as an essential contribution to peacebuilding.  In conclusion, Croatia will continue to give its full support to all aspects of the women, peace and security agenda.  ",
    " I speak on behalf of the European Union (EU) and its member States. Croatia, Turkey, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ukraine and Georgia align themselves with this statement, the full version of which is being circulated in the Chamber.  I thank the Secretary-General, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, the representative on Women's Initiatives for Gender Justice and the Special Envoy of the Office ofthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for their statements delivered earlier today.  Today's debate addresses the root cause ofrecurring and pervasive sexual violence in conflict - the often predominant culture of impunity that allows these crimes to go unrecorded, unpunished and, at worst, tolerated by the community. We cannot combat sexual violence and ensure effective conflict resolution and peacebuilding without tackling this gap at all levels. Such actions must include the following.  With regard to ensuring adequate information, fact- finding and documentation, sexual violence in conflict remains universally underreported. Inter alia, that is the result of the threats faced by those who come forward to report this crime. We reiterate the need to take all measures for the protection of survivors, human rights defenders and journalists, who contribute to collecting information on sexual violence.  With regard to ensuring the prosecution of crimes of sexual Violence and punishing perpetrators of crimes against women and girls under national and international law, we emphasize the significant advancement in international law made by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which includes sexual violence in the definition of crimes, in particular as a crime against humanity, and note that the ICC, as well as the non-permanent International Criminal Tribunals, continue to be important mechanisms in combating sexual violence in conflict. We furthermore acknowledge the national efforts to implement the Rome Statute. The crimes of sexual violence must be excluded from amnesty provisions in conflict-resolution processes. We support the continued application of targeted and graduated measures by the relevant Security Council Sanctions Committees aimed at perpetrators of sexual violence in conflict, as well as other measures at its disposal including referrals to the ICC and steps towards the systematic monitoring of commitments by parties to conflict under resolution 1960 (2010).  With regard to ensuring women's leadership and the participation of women in peace processes and conflict resolution, those processes should also recognize explicitly the need to address crimes of sexual violence, as they lay the foundation for future institution-building and political and legal reforms.  There is a need to ensure the availability of reparations as a form of transitional gender justice, as well as accessible services, including health, education, psychosocial, legal and economic support.  We must raise awareness and combat the normalization of sexual violence, including beyond the end of the conflict, to counter stigmatization, shame and fear of social exclusion, which perpetuate the underreporting of sexual violence. We continue to underline the importance of the continued deployment of women's and child protection advisers.  The European Union continues to implement its dedicated policy on women and peace and security, as well as to support initiatives to strengthen international criminal justice and the rule of law. The EU now has gender advisers and\/or human rights focal points in each of its crisis management missions and operations. The EU supports the swift deployment of human rights observers in Mali by the African Union and the United Nations and provides financial support for the deployment of observers. The EU training mission in Mali includes training on gender and human rights for the Malian armed forces.  We continue to support the work of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict and of the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict. We welcome the report of the Secretary-General (S\/2013\/335) and the recommendations contained therein. We also welcome the Council's adoption of resolution 2106 (2013) today as an expression of the Council's continued determination to keep this issue under close scrutiny.  ",
    " It is an honour to address the Security Council. I thank Foreign Secretary Hague for the United Kingdom's leadership, and Zainab Bangura, Special Representative for her important and extraordinary work.  The Security Council was established 67 years ago and has witnessed 67 years of wars and conflict, but the world has yet to take up war-zone rape as a serious priority. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of women, children and men have been raped in conflicts in our lifetimes. The numbers are so vast and the subject so painful that we often have to stop to remember that behind each number is someone with a name, a personality, a story and dreams no different from ours and those of our children.  Let us be clear what we are speaking about: young girls raped and impregnated before their bodies are able to carry a child, causing fistula; boys held at gunpoint and forced to sexually assault their mothers and sisters; women raped with bottles, wood branches and knives to cause as much damage as possible; toddlers, even babies, dragged from their homes and violated.  I will never forget the survivors whom I have met or what they told me - the mother in Goma whose five-year-old daughter had been raped outside a police station in plain view, or the Syrian woman I met in Jordan last week who asked that I hide her name and face because she knew that if she spoke out against the crimes against her, she would be attacked and possibly killed.  Rape is a tool of war. It is an act of aggression and a crime against humanity. It is inflicted intentionally to destroy the woman, the family and the community. It ruins lives and fuels conflict. The Charter of the United Nations is clear; the Security Council has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. Rape as a weapon of war is an assault on security, and a world in which these crimes happen is one in which there is not and never will be peace. Addressing war-zone sexual violence is therefore the Council's responsibility, as well as the duty of the Governments and countries afflicted by it. In fact, the truth is that in many conflict situations there is no Government to take responsibility, so there is no protection and no accountability. When Governments cannot act, the Security Council must step in and provide leadership and assistance. For those crimes happen not because they are inherent to war, but because the global climate allows it.  That five-year-old girl was raped because her attacker knew that he would get away with it. Because the world has not treated sexual violence as a priority, there have only been a handful of prosecutions for the many hundreds of thousands of survivors. They suffer most at the hands of their rapists, but they are also victims of a culture of impunity. That is the sad, upsetting and, indeed, shameful reality.  I understand that there are many things that are difficult for the Security Council to agree on, but sexual violence in conflict should not be one of them. That it is a crime to rape young children is not something that I imagine anyone in the Chamber would not be able to agree on. The rights and wrongs of the issue are straightforward, and the actions that need to be taken have been identified. What is needed is political will, and that is what is being asked of Member States today: to act on the knowledge of what is right and what is unjust and to show the determination to do something about it. Every country in the world is affected by sexual violence in one form or another, from domestic abuse to female genital mutilation. All countries therefore have a responsibility to step forward, but the starting point must be the Security Council, shouldering its responsibilities and showing leadership. To women in refugee camps or those struggling to survive in war- torn communities, there is no greater power in the world that can stand by them. That young Syrian rape victim is here because the Council represents her. That five-year-old child in the Congo must count because the Council represents her. In her eyes, if her attacker gets away with his crimes, it is because the Council has allowed it. The Council sets the bar. If the Security Council sets rape and sexual violence in conflict as a priority, it will become one, and progress will be made. If it does not, this horror will continue.  I thank and encourage those countries that are already setting a powerful example. My plea to all members of the Council is to adopt and implement the draft resolution that is before the members today, so that the perpetrators are finally held to account and survivors can at last feel that they are on safer ground. Please, do not let the issue fall to the wayside when leaving the Chamber. Meet your commitments; debate the issue in your Parliaments; mobilize people in your countries and built it into all your foreign policy efforts, so that together you can turn the tide of global opinion, shatter impunity and finally put an end to this abhorrence.  ",
    " I would like to thank all ofthe briefers in today's debate for their powerful messages, which the Security Council should take into account in its future deliberations. I would also like to thank the United Kingdom for organizing this important and timely debate, while acknowledging their important contribution to combating sexual violence in conflict situations during its tenure leading the Group of Eight. 1 would also like to commend Australia and Guatemala for organizing an Arria formula meeting on experiences drawn from the work of gender experts in peacekeeping operations. Slovenia joins others in welcoming  resolution 2106 (2013) adopted this morning. Slovenia also fully aligns itself with the statement delivered by the European Union.  One of the key priorities of Slovenia in the United Nations is to address issues of importance to women around the world. It has been acknowledged many times that global stability, peace, and prosperity depend on protecting and advancing the rights of women and girls. But many times we find ourselves too late in implementing preventive measures, which may include efforts to promote the rights of women or other means, and find ourselves in the midst of armed conflicts, where particularly vulnerable groups, such as women and children, are disproportionately impacted.  Needless to say, in such circumstances social norms get stripped away and sexual attacks all too often become a weapon of war. Such Violence leaves behind hundreds of thousands of victims, all of whom are left traumatized and stigmatized for life. Those hideous acts affect whole communities and remain vividly remembered for generations, as seen in the Western Balkans and Rwanda.  It is therefore of paramount importance to look beyond prevention. The investigation of cases of sexual violence in conflict and the holding of perpetrators of sexual violence in armed conflict accountable are also of great importance. Ending impunity is pivotal in addressing sexual violence in conflict. Only that can serve as a strong deterrent for such actions. In that regard, we would like to commend the work of the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict, as well as Justice Rapid Response, an intergovernmental standby facility of active-duty criminal justice and related professionals.  The International Criminal Court is the only international tribunal whose statute explicitly refers to sexual and gender violence as crimes against humanity. The use of the Court in such cases should be an important aspect of establishing peace and security and the rule of law, whereby special attention should be given to the principle of complementarity and to the issue of closing the legal gaps regarding accountability for the most serious international crimes. However, the most important area of focus must remain the victims.  Let us recall that Slovenia, together with Netherlands and Belgium, presented an initiative aimed at improving the international framework for mutual legal assistance and extradition in cases involving the investigation and prosecution ofthe most serious crimes of international concern, including sexual and gender violence as crimes against humanity. As suspects, evidence, witnesses and assets related to those crimes are usually not restricted to the territory of any one State, strengthening mutual legal assistance between States is indispensable for States, if they are to be truly effective in the national prosecution and investigation of those crimes.  Finally, let me inform the Council that these pertinent issues will also be on the agenda of the Bled Strategic Forum, a high-level strategic dialogue among leaders from the private and public sectors to be held in Slovenia in early September of 2013. A panel discussion entitled \"International criminal justice as a precondition for a prosperous economic future?\" will be organized, and it will, inter alia, address the issue of sexual and gender violence, with a particular emphasis on Violence against women and children. We see the meeting as an opportunity to continue this important dialogue and also as a sign of my country's continuous involvement in matters that promote women's rights.  ",
    " I would like to thank you, Madam President, for presiding over this meeting and for enabling us to discuss important aspects of the issue of preventing conflict twice in three days. These two debates (see S\/PV.6946) are inextricably connected, given the fact that the problem of sexual violence is deeply rooted in conflict and not merely an incidental symptom of it. The short period during which these discussions have taken place has served to sow the seeds ofthe success ofyour presidency for the month of April. By the same token, I would like to acknowledge the efforts of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in achieving this lofty and noble goal. I would also like to thank Ms. Zainab Hawa Bangura, Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, as well as Ms. Saran Keita Diakite of the NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security, for their exhaustive briefings and complete and concrete efforts in this area.  We have carefully studied the Secretary-General's report (S\/2013\/149) in the context of today's discussion. In that connection, we would like to express our appreciation for the information it contains, as well as for its conclusions, which should give powerful impetus to and pave the way for efforts aimed at curbing sexual violence against women, children and the elderly in armed conflict. The report describes the achievements of the States concerned in complying with the relevant Security Council resolutions, as well as in taking measures to prevent sexual violence. It also mentions a number of legal and institutional obstacles that stand in the way of achieving the ideal of full protection for women and children in conflict, as well as incorporating and integrating them into the fabric of society.  The Kingdom of Morocco commends the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, particularly in the area of fostering and preserving the progress that has been made, as well as for affirming the shared responsibility of society for combating sexual violence. By the same token, we commend the United Nations initiative on combating sexual violence so as to help those working in peacekeeping operations, as well as to create partnerships between the United Nations and interested parties for strengthening national competence and skills in order to help curb sexual violence committed by parties to a conflict and to protect and support survivors. Implementing such partnerships, and the provision of adequate resources for their effective use, will contribute to achieving these humanitarian goals. By the same token, we would also like to emphasize the importance of taking into consideration the various views and standpoints, and of consulting with the relevant States concerning the establishment of early detection mechanisms for preventing sexual violence.  With regard to the implementation of reporting and oversight mechanisms - and in accordance with resolution 1960 (2010), as mentioned in the report of the Secretary-General - we hope that such measures will serve as the basis for evidence-based actions. Such measures should be objective and meticulous in monitoring sexual violence in conflict and should be carried out in an atmosphere of complete objectivity and independence. They should also primarily relate to Security Council resolutions, aim at supporting international efforts to protect women and girls in conflict and underscore the importance of preventing such crimes.  With regard to prevention, the report of the Secretary-General states that the establishment of refugee camps near conflict areas and the difficulty of gaining access to them, in addition to the lack of registration records for refugees, impede efforts to safeguard refugees and to alleviate their daily suffering.  The protection of refugees is the responsibility of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and of host countries. The protection of refugees constitutes a significant part of UNHCR functions, in addition to identifying and registering them. The needs of refugees must be met and services must be provided to them to guarantee their freedom of movement and expression. They should not be subjected to humanitarian or political blackmail.  Rape and conflict-related sexual violence have deep repercussions for victims, survivors and families. The psychological, social and economic effects increase the marginalization of those groups from society with regard to their access to social and medical services. The signing of peace agreements and ceasefires by parties to a conflict should lead to developing programmes that result in an immediate cessation of sexual violence. Addressing that phenomenon is a main peacebuilding pillar agreed to by the parties.  Committing to combating impunity, implementing cooperation programmes with the judiciary to try perpetrators, and providing reparations to victims of sexual violence constitute the necessary safeguards to ensure that such crimes will not recur. Commitments in that regard must be implemented on the ground; that is a fundamental element in preventing the crimes.  In many countries, developing codes of conduct for security and police forces is very important to providing comprehensive protection from sexual Violence. In that connection, I wish to acknowledge the efforts made by the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict while taking into consideration factors related to national expertise and experience, with a view to reforming the judiciary and facilitating access to it for victims.  Achieving the desired objectives in curbing sexual violence requires the involvement of all parties and the efforts of public authorities, national human rights organizations and every component of civil society, including women's associations, so as to mobilize the necessary efforts to put an end to that scourge. To that end, there must be sufficient technical support and financing from donors.  Sexual violence against women and children in conflict is a crime against the dignity, innocence and humanity of those vulnerable groups. We should not remain silent or condone such crimes or diminish their serious consequences.  Furthermore, sexual violence in conflict threatens social stability and hampers national reconciliation and the unity of a society in the post-conflict stage. We have a long way to go, but that should not dissuade the international community from tackling this scourge on all levels and with all the means available.  ",
    " We thank the Rwandan presidency for convening this important open debate. It is particularly relevant that our debate is being chaired by Minister Louise Mushikiwabo, to whom we convey our thanks. We also thank the Secretary-General for the presentation of his report (S\/2013\/149). We are very aware of his commitment to combating sexual violence in armed conflict.  We also welcome Ms. Zainab Hawa Bangura and commend her on the great work she is carrying out in her role. We thank her for the compelling presentation of her report on her recent visit to Somalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It demonstrates how extensive and serious, at least in those two countries, sexual crimes, including rape as a weapon of war, are.  We also thank Ms. Saran Keita Diakite for her moving statement.  We recognize the importance of mediators and envoys in mediation, ceasefire, peace and preventive diplomacy processes engaging with the parties to a conflict in dialogue on sexual violence, and for such violence to be addressed in peace agreements. We agree with the recommendation of the Secretary- General that sexual violence should be included among prohibited acts and reflected as specific provisions in peace agreements related to security arrangements and transitional justice. It should be recalled, in that regard, that the Organization has developed guidelines for mediators on how to address sexual violence in armed conflicts. Those should be included in the training and orientation of teams that negotiate ceasefires and peace agreements.  We have participated in several informative events conducted by agencies of the system and non-governmental organizations that work in areas of armed conflict. The stories they tell are frightening and reinforce the urgent need for victims and survivors of sexual Violence to have access to medical services and HIV-related treatment and care. It is also necessary to address the difficult situations faced by survivors who have children and by the children born as a result of rape, who then become victims of stigma and social exclusion.  We are highly aware of the priority that must be given to developing and building the capacity of national institutions, in particular the health, judicial and social welfare systems, as well as local civil society networks. That is certainly an area where public-private partnerships are of particular relevance.  It is also worth mentioning the critical role of women's civil society organizations in supporting the prevention and resolution of armed conflicts and in peacebuilding. That was precisely the approach taken in the presidential statement (S\/PRST\/2012\/23) adopted under our presidency of the Security Council in October 2012. In that statement, as part of the fight against impunity for perpetrators of sexual and gender- based crimes, the Council categorically condemned all violations of international law committed against women and girls in armed conflict and post-conflict situations.  Guatemala has supported without reservation the work that the Security Council has been carrying out for several years now aimed at strengthening collective action to combat sexual Violence in armed conflict, in particular through the adoption of resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010). Now, as elected members of the Council, we find that our commitment has been further deepened.  In that regard, we are encouraged by the important change in how sexual violence is being dealt with by the International Criminal Court, in particular with respect to the charges against Bosco Ntaganda of crimes against humanity, rape, sexual slavery and war crimes. The same could be said about the prosecution of Jean-Pierre Bemba. Both cases set a precedent concerning the principle of officers' responsibility for sexual violence as a war crime and crime against humanity. That constitutes an important complement to the work of national courts and mixed tribunals in the fight against deeply rooted discriminatory practices that are embedded in a culture of impunity.  In addition, it helps us to combat the perception that it is useless to denounce the crimes of sexual violence and contributes to the strengthening of the administration of justice, whether civil or military, by holding perpetrators accountable before the law. Moreover, it also helps to realize specific commitments on prohibiting sexual violence committed by senior- ranking officials of armed forces and armed groups, and promotes the adoption of codes of conduct that prohibit sexual violence.  We believe that another step in the right direction is the judgment in the case of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo. Although he was not charged with crimes of sexual slavery and rape, the judgment against him includes specific guidance on the reparations to be made to the victims ofsexual violence, thus making possible specific reparation for the immediate and long-term harm experienced by the Victims. That act of international justice affords hope, dignity and compensation to the victims and enforces accountability for the perpetrators.  What I have referred to leads us to conclude that the annex to the report of the Secretary-General, which lists the parties and individuals credibly suspected of committing or being responsible for systematic rape and other forms of sexual violence during conflict and post-conflict situations, is useful, and that we must increase the pressure on those responsible for those acts and, when appropriate, submit their names to the relevant committees.  ",
    " I want to thank you, Madam President, for organizing this important open debate on the issue of sexual Violence in conflict, an issue to which my delegation attaches great importance and which, unfortunately, remains very topical. I thank the Secretary-General for the presentation of his second annual report on sexual violence in conflict (S\/2013\/l49). I also thank Ms. Zainab Hawa Bangura for her very committed statement and the remarkable work she has carried out as Special Representative of the Secretary-General, with the support of the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict. Finally, I would like to thank Ms. Saran Keita Diakite of Mali, who delivered a strong message on behalf of non-governmental organizations on the need to combat sexual violence, in particular in crisis areas in Africa.  With resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1960 (2010), we have given ourselves the means to act in the fight against the scourge of sexual violence in conflict. Today's open debate is an opportunity to take stock of the implementation of those resolutions and the challenges that lie ahead.  I fully align myself with the statement soon to be delivered on behalf of the European Union.  The evidence is clear: sexual violence in conflict spares no one. It affects adults and children, men as well as women, as evidenced by the increasingly frequent acts of sexual violence against men and boys as a tactic of war or in the context of incarceration or interrogation. The violence documented in Syria, Mali and the Democratic Republic of Congo is the sad illustration of those facts.  The situations of sexual violence in conflict are varied and widespread. That is why it is important for the Security Council to choose, from the arsenal at its disposal, the tools most suited to the different situations.  The Council's actions set an example, and its responsibility in this area is essential. That is clear in the explicit references to the agenda on women and peace and security in the agreed conclusions recently adopted by the Commission on the Status of Women, whose main theme, as I recall, was the elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women.  Less than a week ago, I am pleased to say, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of Eight in London adopted a declaration on preventing sexual violence in conflict, which explicitly seeks to carry forward resolution 1325 (2000) and its successors, and contributes to the normative framework of resolutions on children and armed conflict. That declaration rightly recalls once again that the promotion and protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and children are at the foundation of our fight against sexual violence in conflict.  The Council must be fully informed before acting,  which is why it is so important to establish follow-up, analysis and information-exchange mechanisms within peacekeeping operations and political missions and to provide for the deployment of sufficient numbers of women protection advisers, who have a crucial role to play in the coordination of the implementation of Security Council resolutions on conflict-related sexual violence. Luxemburg will remain committed to ensuring that future mandates, as well as the renewal of existing mandates, take into consideration this important aspect. As the Secretary-General underscored this morning, it is important to constantly incorporate that aspect into mission planning and budgeting.  Once the perpetrators of sexual violence have been identified, the Council can and must, through the adoption of targeted measures, step up pressure on those responsible so that they are brought to justice before a competent court and judged. The Council should be able to draw on such an instrument systematically, in our view, following the practices established by the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004), concerning the Democratic Republic of the Congo for the inclusion on Sanctions Committee lists of those suspected of acts of sexual violence. Information provided by the Special Representative of the Secretary- General would be highly useful in that regard. It is under national jurisdictions that perpetrators should primarily be tried, and we must therefore support national Governments in their fight against impunity. Based on the principle of complementarity, international criminal justice still has an important role to play, and we very much welcome the efforts undertaken in that regard by the International Criminal Court.  In that context, it is noteworthy that a second arrest warrant has been issued against General Bosco Ntaganda, incorporating the major accusations of crimes against humanity, rape and sexual slavery. Today, Bosco Ntaganda is in The Hague to be judged for his crimes. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all Member States that contributed to his transfer to the Court.  Every victory against impunity is a victory against sexual violence, for only the certainty that a crime will not go unpunished is a real deterrent. The fight against impunity is also the first step in reinstating the rights of victims. It is not the only step: it is also necessary to take measures such as granting compensation to repair, as far as possible, the consequences of the damage caused.  We know the extent to which crisis resolution and post-conflict situations are volatile and precarious. That is why it is important once again to ensure the involvement of women in peace processes so that peace and ceasefire agreements fully and systematically take into account the issue of sexual violence.  The fight against sexual violence must also be integrated into all security sector and justice reform processes worthy of the name. In that regard, Luxemburg has supported a number of workshops, including in South Sudan and Liberia, aimed at strengthening the contribution of United Nations peacekeeping operations to the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). In particular, they sought to ensure that women were better represented at all decision-making levels in national, regional and international institutions and mechanisms for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts.  Conflict-related sexual violence is not inevitable. But to bring it to an end, we must take into account the magnitude of this scourge. The alarming report before us today makes it cleat that sexual violence in conflict, although it varies with context, is systematic and universally widespread. It is up to us all to take on our responsibility to bring it to an end. In conclusion, we hope that today's debate, the Special Representative's briefings to the Council on specific situations, such as that on Syria tomorrow, as well as the discussions the Council will hold over the coming months on this topic will enable real results to be achieved. In terms of follow-up, it would be particularly worthwhile to establish, as proposed by the Secretary-General, a system that would better enable us to monitor the fulfilment of commitments undertaken to fight sexual violence by the parties to a conflict in implementation of resolution 1960 (2010).  ",
    " I wish to thank you, Madam President, for organizing this crucial debate, which affords the broader United Nations membership an opportunity to contribute to the women and peace and security agenda. I am also grateful for the concept note that you have circulated (S\/2014\/ 731, annex), which we believe will guide our deliberations to a successful conclusion. And I wish to thank the Secretary-General for his personal and steadfast commitment to this issue, as well as the briefers for their insightful presentations.  We underline and insist that all forms of violence against women are unacceptable and should in no way be tolerated. Unfortunately, statistics show that this phenomenon continues to be pervasive in all countries. It is therefore necessary to intensify efforts at all levels, particularly in terms of prevention and awareness. We urge all Member States to strengthen their support to women victims of violence and ensure their access to the justice system in accordance with human rights standards and regardless of their status.  The number of internally displaced persons and refugees continues to rise worldwide to unprecedented levels, and with it the increased risks faced by displaced women and girls. Due to their vulnerability, women in many conflict situations around the world continue to face intolerable hardship, as they become targets of all forms of violence.  We underline the particular vulnerability of women and children refugees and displaced persons, including exposure to discrimination and sexual and physical abuse, violence and exploitation. In that regard, we acknowledge the importance of preventing, responding to and addressing sexual and gender-based issues.  Since the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), the United Nations has adopted specific policy directives to achieve gender equality in peacekeeping operations. To further contriubute to that end, there is a need to consider having the United Nations step up the deployment of women protection advisers and gender advisers in both peacekeeping and political missions, as well as in humanitarian operations.  At the regional level, the African Union has made the protection of women's right across the continent a priority. It is committed to promoting and working to achieve gender equality in line with the gender policy adopted by the African Union in 2009. In that regard, we emphasize that States have the primary responsibility to provide protection and assistance to refugees and internally displaced persons within their jurisdiction, as well as to address the root causes of the displacement problem, in appropriate cooperation with the international community.  Since the ratification of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 1996, Algeria has made great efforts to place the protection and promotion women's rights at  the centre of its national policies, strategic objectives and programmes. The situation of women in Algeria has experienced a very positive trend through combined efforts by the Government and civil society.  While we reiterate Algeria's support for the implementation of the relevant provisions of the resolution 1325 (2000), we would like to underline that firm political will and full commitment by Member States on the relevant measures set out in the resolution, which marks this year its fourteenth anniversary, will guarantee the active participation of women in national, regional and international institutions for the prevention, protection and management of conflict situations.  I am happy and proud, Madam President, that your actions eloquently attest to your sober handling of the work of the Security Council this month, including by placing this issue on the Council's agenda. For me, in  our troubled world, \"women , peace\" and \"security\" are synonimous.  ",
    " I thank you, Madam President, for holding this important debate today and for your personal commitment to this issue. I also warmly thank Ms. Mlambo-Ngcuka, Mr. Mulet and Mr. Beyani for their compelling and sobering briefings. I would particularly like to welcome Ms. Suaad Allami from Iraq and to thank her for sharing her experiences with the Council today. I also thank everyone who has come to this meeting to demonstrate their interest and commitment. Their presence here is an encouragement to all of us to do more.  Today, one year on from the adoption of resolution 2122 (2013) and one year before the fifteenth anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000), we consider the strides that we have made and what remains to be done to make our commitments real on this Vital agenda. I welcome the Secretary-General's report (S\/2014\/693), which demonstrates that attention to women and peace and security is increasing across the board. Over a third of those included in Colombia's peace talks are women, as we have heard. That figure rises to 75 per cent in the Philippines.  We welcome the dedicated consideration of gender issues in such processes since last year. There are more trained investigators of sexual and gender- based violence deployed than ever before. This year, an unprecedented 40 per cent of ambassadors at the Security Council are women. However, that progress is incremental. Sadly, those are exceptions to the rule. The fact that we still have to fight to include sufficient gender expertise in our peacekeeping operations, most recently in the Central African Republic and Mali, that we still have to battle to have just one women included in most peace processes, and that Governments and armed groups continue to Violate and to abuse women's rights, including by perpetrating sexual and gender- based vilence, makes clear that a real commitment to women and peace and security is still piecemeal. The peacekeeping review and the global study are two opportunities to galvanize action on those issues but change must start now. The report of the Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict will also be published shortly. We encourage all actors to implement its recommendations.  Presidential statement S\/PRST\/2014\/21, which we have adopted today, has four key elements. First, it reiterates core principles of resolution 2122 (2013) with regard to women's leadership and gender equality and the working methods of the Council. Secondly, it calls on Member States to enhance protection and services for displaced women and girls and for sex and age-disaggregated data to inform policy and programming. Thirdly, it highlights the tremendous impact of violent extremism on women and urges States to protect and to engage with them in addressing that trend. Finally, it calls for all actors to review and to reinvigorate their commitments ahead of the 2015 high- level review.  We are living through a period of unusual instability. According to the Institute for Economics and Peace, only 11 countries in the world are not linked to conflict in some way. For the first time since the Second World War, the number of refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced persons has exceeded 50 million. If displaced people had their own country, it would be the twenty-fourth most populous in the world. That is a staggering statistic. The United Kingdom recognizes the particular hardships faced by refugees and internally displaced persons, including the additional burden and vulnerability of women and girls. We have provided the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees with over $180 million in the period 2011-2014. We have committed over $1 billion to helping people affected by conflict in Syria, while in Iraq we provide $40 million in humanitarian aid, $30 million of which supports international non-governmental organizations, United Nations agencies and the International Committee of the Red Cross. That includes supporting programmes to prevent and respond to sexual violence - for example, by establishing women-and-children centres to provide group counselling, as well as providing safe spaces for children.  In crises like those in Syria and Iraq, many of the most vulnerable households are headed by women, who often lack access to basic necessities to meet their needs and those of their children. The United Kingdom has provided cash assistance to help female refugees in Jordan pay their rent and receive livelihood support. Pregnant women are particularly at risk. We are providing essential equipment to new mothers and pregnant women in Iraq and reproductive health services for women in Jordan. We also provide financial support for vulnerable Syrian women who are thought to be at risk of coerced marriage.  Gender-sensitive programming must be increased alongside access to international protection, health and education services and livelihood activities in conflict- affected States. We must do that for all displaced persons, particularly women and girls. The international community must also step up its efforts to address the root causes of conflict. That requires concerted long- term effort and financing. The benefits of that are clear.  Finally, we must put women and girls at the forefront of our approach to tackling violent extremism and defeating the extremist ideology that underpins the barbaric acts of groups such as Boko Haram and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. We must not allow the crackdown on women's rights - from prohibiting girls' education to enslaving women's bodies - to go unheeded. Women must be part of the solution.  We have a formidable task before us. I am confident, however, that through our shared purpose and with effective follow-up, we can convert the expertise and goodwill in the Chamber to greater protection for some of the most vulnerable people around the world and create space for women to be full and equal partners in all endeavours to strengthen peace and security. We must redouble all our efforts in the important year that lies ahead.  ",
    " I thank you, Madam President, for convening this open debate on women and peace and security, with a focus on the important topic of displaced women and girls. I also congratulate you on your successful presidency of the Security Council this month.  The United Arab Emirates welcomes the comprehensive presidential statement (S\/PRST\/2014\/21) adopted by Council members by consensus this morning. We join others in thanking the Secretary- General for his recent report (S\/2014\/693), which provides important information on the progress made thus far and the considerable challenges that remain in the full implementation of the agenda. We would also like to thank Executive Director of UN-Women Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka for her bold call to action. In addition, we would like to thank this morning's briefers for their thoughtful and important presentations.  Today's open debate is focused on displaced women and girls, which is of the utmost importance as new crises and outbreaks of violence increase the levels of forced displacement. Today's 51 million refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) represent the largest number of refugees, asylum-seekers and IDPs since the Second World War; three quarters of the displaced persons are women and children.  Many here present have acknowledged today in their statements that as Member States we must work together to address this issue. We must ensure consistent leadership to strengthen the meaningful participation of and leadership opportunities for women, including in tackling the root causes and impacts of displacement. We need to ensure the consistent and effective implementation of the Security Council resolutions on women and peace and security.  Within the United Nations system, we need to encourage further gender-sensitive conflict analysis and stand by our women and peace and security commitments so that we can best understand the progress that has been made, as well as the challenges that remain in implementation.  Through those actions, we the Member States can do our part to ensure that the women and peace and security agenda remains central to efforts to achieve our shared goal of international peace and security.  It has been 14 years since the historic adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), whereby the international community formally recognizes the vital role played by women in the prevention, mitigation and resolution of conflict, in addition to recognizing the differential burden borne by women and girls during conflict.  Much progress has been made in the field of women and peace and security. Within the United Nations system, the women and peace and security agenda has been increasingly integrated. The data in the Secretary- General's report shows important progress. In terms of prevention, there is more consistent attention to women and peace and security in Security Council deliberations; three quarters of United Nations resolutions adopted in 2013 contained women and peace and security related references.  Under the protection pillar, there have been improvements in peacekeeping mission mandates and monitoring and training, with clear directives calling for the increased participation of women in the ranks of United Nations police and military.  At the level ofreliefand recovery, there has also been an increased focus on women's economic empowerment in peacebuilding, with a growing recognition of the importance of post-conflict economic stability in resolution 2122 (2013) and in the declaration adopted in 2013 by the Peacebuilding Commission on women's economic empowerment. The resolutions recognize that women's economic empowerment generates long- term social dividends, as evidence shows that women tend to reinvest up to 90 per cent of their income back into their families. The economic security of women in post-conflict situations is therefore fundamental to ensuring lasting peace and stability.  Yet many challenges remain. Today's statements recognize that unacceptable lags remain in the implementation of widely accepted norms, despite the clear presence ofpolitical will. For example, while there has been increased global attention towards sexual violence in conflict, much work remains to ensure that this attention is translated into action, including justice and assistance for the victims.  Widespread violations of international humanitarian law continue worldwide, as do the challenges in ensuring the protection of civilians. The culture of impunity remains widespread. As many Member States have recognized, we are also navigating a shifting security context where the rise of violent extremism has led to increased and targeted violence against women and girls, which is unacceptable to the United Arab Emirates and all responsible Member States.  Although this is a global reality, it is a particularly urgent problem in our region. In Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Turkey, four out of five refugees and displaced persons are women or children. Within Syria, there are 4.25 million internally displaced persons, with 6.8 million in need ofhumanitarian assistance. We note the important data brought to light by the September report of the International Rescue Committee on the plight of Syrian women and children. The collection of data must remain a priority for the international community to further bolster our arguments and ensure that justice prevails - without exception - for all.  The numbers of the forcibly displaced continue to rise daily and require our urgent attention, with many fleeing today to neighbouring States. Displaced persons comprise one fifth of Lebanon's population. In Jordan, the Zaatari refugee camp is Jordan's third largest city, in terms of sheer numbers. The pressure on host communities is enormous, with ramifications in neighbouring countries as well.  The United Arab Emirates has tried to play its part and has taken measures to address the needs of those forcibly displaced and to prevent and protect women from violence at international and regional levels.  The United Arab Emirates has built the Mrajeeb Al-Fahood refugee camp at the Jordanian border, for Syrian refugees, exclusively for married couples, children and women. The family-focused nature of the camp has helped to protect women from harassment, extra-marital violence and exploitation and has served to reduce overall levels of violence towards women and children within the camp.  The United Arab Emirates is also committed to advocacy within the United Nations. We have launched a panel series on women and peace and security in partnership with UN-Women and the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security in support of the global study on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). The series aims to address the challenges associated with the implementation of the resolution and  to identify emerging issues and generate opportunities to further the goals of the women and peace and security agenda.  Yesterday our panel discussion explored the many roles that women play both in countering violent extremism and also, sometimes, as protagonists in its spread. The discussion was nuanced, but some clear recommendations and themes emerged. First, women must be included at the conceptual stage in the development of effective strategies to counter violent extremism. Secondly, we must acknowledge that women are not a homogenous group, and our approach should reflect that. Thirdly, we need to create the political spaces for the many voices of women to be heard. That is the space where we may find solutions in local and culturally specific contexts. Fourthly, we must recognize women as the agents of change that they are, and not solely as victims. Fifthly, we must always challenge the dominant narrative that views violent extremism through a strictly security-focused lens.  By linking women's roles in strategies to counter violent extremism with security issues, we run the risk of further marginalizing women and women's organizations. We need to take a more holistic approach to forced displacement, where we look outside of conventional security approaches and focus on the development and everyday needs of the forcibly displaced. By addressing the everyday needs, we can help create an environment that allows for women, their families and communities to fully participate in the prevention of violent extremism in their own societies. Finally, we must continue to call for increasing funding for data collection and reporting to ensure that what is emerging as consensus in the conversation on the women-peace-security nexus is reinforced by hard facts.  The United Nations remains the central forum for addressing the women and peace and security agenda. Much progress has been made through the continual, concerted efforts of UN-Women and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in addressing the gender-specific needs of internally displaced persons and refugees. The United Arab Emirates stands with our United Nations and international partners in that important endeavour and urges for 2015 to be the year where we move the dial forward in a significant way.

    " First of all, I would like to thank the Secretary-General and his Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Ms. Bangura, for their briefings. I would also like to thank Ms. Rhoda Misaka for her powerful briefing as a representative of civil society.  Japan welcomes the latest report of the Secretary- General on this agenda item (S\/2014\/181). Newly introduced national-level policy recommendations will help the Security Council to continuously monitor country-specific situations. Japan also appreciates that the report highlights the role of United Nations Action as a coordination mechanism, and its activities on enhancing prevention.  Security Council resolution 2106 (2013) provided, for the first time, the theme of sexual violence in conflict with a comprehensive prevention framework. We believe that the emphasis on prevention is vital if we are ever to defeat conflict-related sexual violence.  Progress on the ground is dependent upon concrete action by both national Governments and civil society in affected countries. The international community must support them to achieve change on the ground.  The Japanese Government fully supports the Special Representative of the Secretary-General's new priorities of strengthening national ownership, leadership and responsibility. In appreciation ofthe work of the Special Representative, the Japanese Government invited Ms. Bangura to Japan last November. During her visit, Prime Minister Abe reassured her of Japan's commitment to cooperating closely with her Office. We are deepening our collaboration with her Office, as well as its Team of Experts and United Nations Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict. Japan is now the second largest contributor to the Special Representative's Office, after Sweden.  One example of Japan's assistance is a contribution of $2 million dollars to support the work of the Team of Experts in Somalia and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In those countries, the Special Representative and her Team of Experts, through their engagement efforts, have succeeded in forging political commitments with national Governments. Joint communiques were later signed between the Special Representative and the respective Governments. Japan's financial contribution will help those Governments to implement the communiques. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, we are helping the Government expand and consolidate the special police for the protection of women and children. We will also support the activities of the special representative of President Kabila on sexual violence once that post is filled.  Furthermore, on International Women's Day, the Japanese Mission and the Office of the Special Representative co-hosted a special event here in New York in order to raise awareness of the topic we are discussing today. We look forward to further cooperation with the Special Representative in that regard, including at the upcoming Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, to be held in London in June.  ",
    " Thank you, Mr. President, for organizing this important debate. I also thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Ms. Zainab Bangura, and Ms. Rhoda Misaka for their statements.  We take note of the report (S\/2014\/181) of the Secretary-General on conflict-related sexual violence, submitted to the Security Council for the information of its members, as well as the analysis and recommendations contained therein.  We recognize and welcome the fact that this year the Security Council will be more focused on consolidation efforts aimed at the implementation of its resolutions 2106 (2013) and 2122 (2013). That will be a genuine contribution to the global commitment to end sexual violence in conflict. We are fully committed to addressing all forms of violence against women and girls, including sexual violence in conflict. The protection of women in conflict situations and ending impunity remain our utmost priorities.  In our efforts to end impunity we acknowledge the active advocacy efforts of the United Nations, inter alia with Governments, in addressing sexual violence in armed conflict, particularly of the mandates of the Secretary-General's Special Representatives for Children and Armed Conflict and Sexual Violence in Conflict. We shall continue to cooperate closely with them in the future as well.  We are also committed to the provisions of the Declaration of Commitment to End Sexual Violence in Conflict adopted by the Foreign Ministers of the Group of Eight in London on 11 April 2013.  We believe that the prosecution of sexual violence crimes, as well as national ownership and responsibility in addressing the root causes of sexual violence in armed conflict, are central to the prevention of such acts in the future. Sexual violence in armed conflict cannot be accepted as a cultural phenomenon. It is not an inevitable consequence of war or a lesser crime. Therefore, we advocate the importance of the victim's access to justice in conflict and post-conflict settings.  In that context, we want to underline the importance of rulings of the international tribunals - the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda - which defined sexual violence as an instrument of warfare and rape as a crime against humanity. In the Akayesu case, sexual violence was recognized as an element of genocide. The impact of those two rulings was that hundreds of victims got the courage to testify against perpetrators throughout the world.  Women's political, social and economic empowerment, gender equality and the mobilization of men and boys in an effort to combat all forms of violence against women are essential in long-term efforts to prevent sexual violence in armed conflict and post-conflict situations. Therefore, we fully support the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and subsequent resolutions on women and peace and security. As a member of the Executive Board, we shall continue to support all the efforts of UN-Women in this area as well.  We are aware that States bear the primary responsibility to respect and ensure the human rights of all individuals within their territory. Addressing the injustices of sexual violence in armed conflict is critical on two levels. First, it provides support to persons who are survivors of such atrocities; and, secondly, it furthers the transformation from a State affected by violence to one of lasting peace.  Sexual violence is a form of psychosocial torture where the suffering of the victims extends to their families, and through families reflects the entire society, while the suffering does not cease after the act of violence is committed. The victims very often have to fight the outside factor - the stigma of society where the victim is blamed and penalized but the perpetrator is free to have a normal life. That is why we strongly believe that an effective national strategy to end sexual violence must include programmes to challenge the existing culture of impunity for these crimes. It must emphasize the role of all, men and women, as active contributors to change.  We have a track record of definitive action in implementing resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security. We were the first country in South- East Europe to develop a comprehensive national action plan for its implementation.  For example, our national action plan mandates that the topics of gender equality and the prohibition of sexual harassment, gender-based violence and discrimination be incorporated into curriculums of policy academies. It requires that a zero-tolerance approach be applied to any form of illicit sexual behaviour of peacekeeping mission personne. And it calls for the creation and  improvement of programmes to provide psychosocial support and economic empowerment to women who are survivors of trafficking or sexual violence.  With the aim of improving the overall situation of women victims ofrape, we are making efforts to finalize the process of developing our second action plan for the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) for the period 2014-2017, which contains important provisions for survivors of conflict-related sexual violence. We are also working on a programme for improving the status of women victims of wartime rape, sexual violence and other forms of torture for the period 2013-2016.  Involving women in conflict prevention and mediation and the deployment of women's protection advisers to United Nations peacekeeping and special political missions is crucial to building and reinforcing peace. We have been working on additional efforts to advance this issue and have adopted a policy that one third of nominated candidates for peacekeeping missions must be women.  This year, Bosnia and Herzegovina presented a candidate for the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). If elected, our candidate will place her priority on prevention and raising awareness of these most important issues. She will continue fighting against prejudice and impunity. My country attaches great significance to this candidature and thus hopes to advance the CEDAW agenda.  With regard to the provisions of the report of the Secretary-General and to the visit of Special Representative Zainab Bangura to Bosnia and Herzegovina in June 2013, our authorities provided comments and additional remarks to the Office of the Special Representative.  Finally, I should like to point out that the international community must permanently work on strengthening United Nations efforts to address sexual violence in armed conflict. Bosnia and Herzegovina stands ready to contribute to those efforts.  In addition, I should like to inform the Council that Bosnia and Herzegovina aligns itself with the statement delivered today by the delegation of the European Union.  ",
    " I would like to congratulate you, Madam President, on your country's presidency of the Council this month.  While there is much to say on this subject, for the sake of brevity I would like to start by pointing out that at the present stage of its history, the human race has enormously strengthened its physical, emotional and intellectual capacities. That is not a bad thing unless we give such strengths free rein to indulge in selfish exploitation and consumption and to focus solely on greed for self-enrichment in a way that enables a creed of individualism and predatory behaviour to dominate. This is an inborn tendency of humankind, from which spring our separations, divisions, oppositions, conflicts and so forth, resulting, inevitably, in wars.  To put a stop to such myopic, vicious self- destructiveness, we need a strong and decisive force capable of inserting itself into this physical, emotional and intellectual contest. What we need today is to be energized by a new force, that of spirituality and conscience. It is no coincidence that many have called this the era of the awakening of our conscience, although clearly it is not something that will happen easily. The reality is that this process is opposed by various powerful lobbies that exert their political, financial, economic and mass-communications influence to control Governments, directly or indirectly. But despite their opposition, the awakening of our collective conscience is still a reality.  Let us consider some major changes that have occurred in recent history - the rise of a culture of ecology; the growth of a preservationist culture aimed at protecting animal species at risk of extinction; an increase in volunteering activities and human generosity to others, rather than confining efforts to family members and people we know in closed circles or groups; personal inner growth, creating greater awareness and thus greater feelings of responsibility towards society at large; and, last but not least, the embrace of a wider, more holistic culture and vision of life. All of these are signs that the awakening of our conscience exists and is a genuine movement.  What about women, then? Why, in spite of such an awakening of our conscience, do women today still continue to see their rights abused, whether as citizens of the world or as people? It is shocking that in today's advanced world we still have to talk about the rights of women and children as if it were a special concession. Rather than commenting on such an absurdity, repeating once again words that have been said over and over since time immemorial, or speculating intellectually on this issue, I would like to give it more constructive consideration.  Unfortunately, the system by which humankind operates is based on a structure of contradiction, so that whatever may be promoted on the one hand is nullified on the other. We do not take this factor of inherent contradiction into serious consideration, and because it is underestimated, this virus is free to worm its way into our human apparatus and to negatively affect the logic of our behaviour, to the point of affecting the social and intellectual frameworks on which we human beings have constructed the rules for our coexistence. In fact, society in general has based its standards on corrupt values that while supposed to be genuine turn out not to be genuine at all. That is why our society stands for poverty, degradation, corruption, depravity, perversion, the abuse of power, conspiracy, genocide and thousands of other miseries. Since our whole social system has been based on unnatural, subverted values, it has become clear that the system on which we base our way of life is consequently vicious and crushing.  What is needed is a new leadership, based on holistic scientific and educational models that can encourage leaders to observe both themselves and their actions, something that is a precondition for establishing a culture where conscience dominates. In that regard, I should reiterate that it is vital that we find science-based solutions to these issues, and thus that we ensure that scientific programmes are part of the educational and training systems whereby human beings can be taught according to a holistic vision of life that can overturn the sterile philosophies and frameworks that govern us.  As for the younger generation, rather than teaching them only how to earn money, they should be supported through good governance in understanding their innate creative attitude with a view to self-realization. They can be taught natural ways of living, and thereby learn how emotions work and how to listen to each other. They can be taught how, in situations of conflict, to evoke calm in themselves and through their surroundings while practicing good communication methods.  Turning to the subject of women, research has shown that women have an advantage in negotiating because of two skills more often related to them. One is listening, which enables interest and awareness of the importance of truly listening to another person's point of view and processing it in the context of one's own point of view, instead of always thinking that one's point of view is the only one that is correct.  The second quality and skill that women have that is helpful in the context of negotiations is that they tend to focus on cooperation more than on competition or control. Research has shown that a cooperation-oriented personality leads more often to situations of tolerance that, in my view, are eventually palliative and understanding that are crucial in reaching an agreement.  Another point is that women having a voice in peace and security fulfils a proposed focus area of the post- 2015 development agenda concerning gender equality and women's empowerment. It also overlaps the focus area of sustainable society because when women feel empowered due to a peaceful situation, they can create a peaceful family setting, as they are crucial in the raising of children. That peaceful family context then sets the stage for a more peaceful and sustainable society, and therefore a more peaceful world.  It is a well-respected fact that women, who comprise more than half of the world's population, help to keep and protect peace and security through their strong family ties and work in the home, as well as through their influence on the work place and policy in their professional and diplomatic lives. Just like that of the men of honour throughout the world, women's influence is critical to making and preserving the global village of peace and security that every family and community needs and wants.  Fortunately, the United Nations - in its wisdom - has recognized the importance that women play in issues of peace and security by establishing UN-Women. While necessary, UN-Women can also be seen as the result of a distorted societal system and evidence that women have made concessions denying them certain rights.  That is why it is aberrant and offensive to see vicious men, hateful of all society - despite anything they may say - attacking women in public, especially the most defenceless, in the name of some cause or as an act of war, or aberrant pleasure in conflict.  Violence against women is merely violence, without merit or cause. It is without justification and demonstrates the abandonment of hope. And it is not merely violence against women that is unacceptable and tragic, but sexual violence in particular. Rape, as is known, is not a crime of sex but of violence, not a show of power but of immeasurable weakness. It demonstrates the worst in men and in civilization. How is it that men in conflict condone such degradation not only to the women they harm, but ultimately to themselves and all humankind, through acts of sexual violence against women during wartime?  In the end, sexual violence against women in conflict is not a sign of the strength of one power over another -although militias may believe that due to reasons that may date back to generations and civilizations when women were the property of men and their subjugation by opposing forces reflected back on the parties to the conflict.  Our world now has evolved to where it is clear and well-known that those terrible acts stand alone and apart from war, expressing the rapists' inabilities, impotencies and wrongful thinking. Sexual violence against women during conflict only reinforces in the minds of the civilized world how wrong those guilty warriors are and how bereft of merit their positions must be to fall so low as to hurt the most vulnerable, the most innocent and perhaps the least able to defend themselves in those moments, against the senseless, barbaric acts.  As our consciousness continues to grow and the world evolves, we must take a united stand and say \"never more\" to violence against women. We must hope that those involved in conflict will one day understand why they go to war and why half of the world does not participate in their argument or in the spoils of war. Yet that half always plays a part in the healing and the return from conflict to peace and security once again.  ",
    " Let me begin by expressing our appreciation to the Nigerian presidency for convening an open debate on conflict-related sexual violence, an issue that plagues and exacerbates many contemporary conflicts.  We thankthe Secretary-General forhis comprehensive report (S\/2014\/181) and recommendations, including the country-specific ones, and the updated annex on suspected perpetrators. We also sincerely commend Ms. Zainab Bangura, Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, and her team all over the world for their hard work and dedication, as well as the members of the United Nations Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict, the Friends of 1325 and the NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security. Our sincere congratulations go to Ms. Bineta Diop, the first African Union Special Envoy on Women, Peace and Security, on her recent appointment.  At the outset, Lithuania aligns itself with the statement to be delivered by observer of the European Union.  Despite all of the efforts of the international community and the establishment of legal and normative frameworks, including seven Security Council resolutions, conflict-related sexual violence is on the rise. It is getting more complex. It is used to displace civilian populations, to seize land and property and to illicitly extract natural resources. Children are sexually assaulted and suffer from stigma when born out of rape. Young girls are trafficked, forced to marry rebels and used as messengers. Boys and men are subjected to sexualized violence. Sexual violence has become a tactic and weapon of war and impunity prevails. The only way to effectively address this scourge is a comprehensive and integrated approach which entails prevention, early warning, justice, accountability, the participation of women in political processes and economic empowerment.  The inclusion of provisions on sexual Violence in the Arms Trade Treaty is just one of the recent encouraging examples of action in that regard. In its turn the Security Council, in resolution 2106 (2013) a the fourth resolution focused on conflict-related sexual violence - has reaffirmed the centrality of gender equality and women's political, social and economic empowerment to preventing sexual violence and further developed the operational framework on conflict- related sexual violence. Among other operational provisions, it calls for the further deployment of women protection advisers and gender advisers to the relevant United Nations peacekeeping and political missions, as well as humanitarian operations.  The Security Council has also recognized the need for more systematic monitoring and more timely, objective, accurate and reliable information as a basis for prevention and response. The Security Council's support of the monitoring, analysis and reporting arrangements on conflict-related sexual violence has contributed to a better understanding of the scope and roots of the problem and facilitated a more proactive stance of United Nations teams on the ground. Having more robust monitoring and reporting mechanisms, the Security Council could also consider developing a procedure that would ensure systematic monitoring of the implementation of its decisions and commitments taken up by parties to conflict.  At the same time, the lack of adequate national capacity and expertise to prevent, investigate and prosecute violence remain among the main impediments in combating sexual violence and ensuring accountability. We are encouraged by the United Nations efforts to assist the strengthening of national capacities. We welcome the extremely important work of the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict, which is being rapidly deployed in situations of particular concern with respect to sexual violence in armed conflict to assist national authorities in strengthening the rule of law.  Another concrete and laudable example is the joint UN-Women\/Justice Rapid Response training, roster management, and deployment mechanism established upon a request of the Secretary-General to ensure that each commission of inquiry is provided with expertise on investigations of sexual and gender-based violence. It is also of paramount importance that peacekeepers continue to be trained to prevent and respond to conflict-related sexual violence, and that special training materials be prepared, preferably in the native languages of peacekeepers. Peacekeeping forces must ensure that internally displaced persons camps are free of alleged perpetrators. The United Nations Blue Helmets themselves must strictly follow the rules of conduct.  Lithuania strongly supports the Group of Eight declaration on preventing sexual violence in conflict, and we are glad to learn that over 140 States have already endorsed the declaration of commitment that was introduced in New York in September 2013. Lithuania looks forward to the global summit in London in June this year, where specific actions are to be identified and agreed.  However broad and strong it may be, international assistance will not provide sustainable results unless it is complemented by national commitment. National political leaders have a major role to play in ensuring that international law is transposed into national law and implemented. National ownership and responsibility should be key priorities. We welcome the facilitation of national responsibility efforts through the joint communiques between the United Nations and the Governments of the Central African Republic, Cote D'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea and Somalia, as per the Secretary-General's report.  We note with appreciation that women, peace and security issues are included in the Secretary-General's country-specific reports under a separate heading. The Security Council could also consistently include the women, peace and security agenda in the terms of reference of its visiting missions. As the Council continues to horizontally integrate the issues of sexual violence into its work, including in the drafting or renewing mandates of United Nations peacekeeping and special political missions, relevant sanctions committees must review their listing and de-listing guidelines, add sexual violence to their lists of criteria, harmonize designation criteria for listed individuals by including any relevant charges from international justice mechanisms, consider sanctioning parties identified by the Secretary-General and his Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict. The Council at its disposal has and should actively consider other means to ensure accountability, such as a referrals to the International Criminal Court, special tribunals and commissions of inquiry.  The International Commission of Inquiry on the Central African Republic should provide all relevant information to the Committee established pursuant to resolution 2127 (2013) in order to list the perpetrators and send a strong signal that all offenders will be held accountable. The capacity of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic to monitor and report human rights violations, including sexual violence, must also be enhanced.  The sexual violence in Syria against women and men, including in Government detention facilities; non-State armed groups targeting female family members of Government forces; and more than 300 cases of gender-based Violence in three health clinics in Damascus and Rural Damascus alone are clear violations of international humanitarian law and resolution 2139 (2014). We support referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. Only by using all available tools at our hands will we be able to prevent further violence and end this vicious cycle of impunity. The experience in combating conflict-related sexual violence in the Central African Republic, Syria and many other countries, as reported by the Secretary- General, shows that the United Nations has to find meaningful ways to engage non-State actors.  Finally, let me touch upon the issue of survivors. Care for and protection of survivors of sexual violence are another vital issue to address in order to fight stigmatization and reprisals and prevent violence and impunity in the future. We believe that reparations could significantly contribute to restoring justice, especially when other means are not feasible.  Twenty years after the end of the Balkan War, an estimated 20,000 survivors of crimes of sexual violence have not seen justice. The alleged perpetrators enjoy positions of influence while victims and their children born of rape are left to suffer stigmatization and shame. Women were excluded from the peace negotiations, even though women's organizations were the first to initiate meetings with people from the other side, trying to find common ground and ways to stop the violence. That is the probable reason why the Dayton peace accords did not include the provisions recommended in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Beijing Platform for Action. Indeed, our toolbox is full of useful instruments but it is now time to take matters into our own hands, consolidate our actions on the ground and deliver together and in close cooperation with all humanitarian, diplomatic, justice, security and civil society actors.

    " It is an honour for Austria to speak today in its capacity as current Chair of the Human Security Network and therefore on behalf of the following countries: Chile, Costa Rica, Greece, Ireland, Jordan, Mali, Norway, Panama, Switzerland, Thailand, Slovenia, South Africa as an observer, and my own country Austria.  Let me first of all thank all speakers for their briefings and commend them for their important work. We also welcome the adoption of presidential statement S\/PRST\/2014\/21 earlier today.  I would like to express our strong appreciation for the focus of today's debate on refugee and displaced women and girls. The vast majority of displaced persons are women and girls who often face increased insecurity in their lives, health, rights and livelihoods and are particularly vulnerable to gender-based violence and sexual exploitation. While we note that significant progress has been made, especially at the normative level, we are deeply concerned that the progress has been hampered by a proliferation of new crises with outbreaks of violence and unprecedented levels of displacement, particularly affecting women and girls. Moreover, we are witnessing armed groups and violent extremist groups targeting women and girls in particular.  Our group is deeply concerned about the use of systematic and widespread sexual violence as a tool of intimidation, retribution and social control, as well as the continued use of sexual violence as a means of displacing populations. We urge all parties to immediately cease such atrocities and to hold perpetrators to account. We also call upon the members of the Security Council to use all means at its disposal to address sexual violence in armed conflicts, including making referrals to the International Criminal Court and other relevant actions. We welcome the clear global, regional and national commitments taken to tackle that.  We also welcome the recommendations in the Secretary-General's report (S\/2014\/693), including those on steps that can be taken by the Security Council to reinforce and implement the prevention framework outlined in resolution 2106 (2013). We recognize especially the need to pay increased attention to improved protection and accountability for the full range of gender-related human rights violations. We support the efforts to strengthen early warning and early action ability to prevent and respond to serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.  I wish to highlight in particular that women's empowerment and participation are essential to any prevention and protection response. We need to strengthen our efforts to ensure that women in situations of displacement have access to resources, services, financial independence and decision-making processes. We need to develop tailor-made services for displaced women, foster gender-sensitive needs assessments and the collection of sex- and age-disaggregated data and to make progress in linking relief, rehabilitation and development.  To improve the situation of women and girls, we also need to make better use of international legal and policy instruments. In that respect, we welcome the upcoming entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty, which mandates exporting States parties explicitly to take into account the risk of serious acts of gender- based violence or violence against women and children.  Strengthening civil society, including grass-roots women's organizations and networks that provide assistance to victims and survivors of sexual violence in conflict, can enable the restoration of dignity and respect and provide the necessary skills, treatment and care to empower individuals to protect themselves and defend their rights.  The Human Security Network would like to reiterate the importance of women's participation in all stages of conflict resolution processes. We strongly support the deployment of women protection advisers and the designation of gender focal points in the United Nations peacekeeping and political missions, and believe that their positions should be provided for within the missions' budgets.  To conclude, let me highlight the importance we place on reviewing our progress on women and peace and security next year in the context of the twentieth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. In particular, on today's anniversary, we are looking forward to the high-level review in 2015 to assess progress at the global, regional and national levels in implementing resolution 1325 (2000) and especially to the renewed momentum we will gather to further strengthen and implement all our commitments on women and peace and security. The global study on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) is an important step in that direction and we look forward to the results of that important study.  We must all strive to improve the protection of women and girls in situations of conflict or displacement, and the Human Security Network will continue to contribute to that shared goal.  Finally, in my national capacity, I would like to add that as a contribution to UN-Women's campaign in the lead-up to the twentieth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, as well as to the global study on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), Austria will host an international symposium in Vienna early next month. The symposium's results will be published in a policy paper intended to sum up real-life expertise in conflict prevention, analysis, resolution and peacebuilding, and to provide recommendations on how to address the most pressing issues.

    " Slovakia thanks the presidency of Chile for initiating this important open debate on the protection of civilians in armed conflict. We think that it is important that this issue remain under the periodic consideration and review of the Security Council and all United Nations agencies.  Slovakia fully aligns itself with the statement made by the observer of the European Union. In addition I would like to raise a few points that we consider important when addressing this topic, namely, the significance of adapting to the new emerging threats, accountability and the contribution of security-sector reform.  First of all, we share the concern of the Secretary- General that, despite the progress achieved with respect to increased resources, structures and more robust and complex mandates for peacekeeping missions, we are still seeing inconsistent results with regard to the effective protection of civilians in challenging conflict environments. In fact, we are seeing a continued rise in the number of civilians who are victims of armed conflicts. Part of the challenge is that new and emerging conflicts are themselves becoming more complex, and our traditional responses and approaches are therefore becoming less effective.  In that regard, we can see from the recent conflicts involving Boko Haram in Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin region, as well as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in Iraq and Syria, that the new security challenges are increasingly transnational in nature, yet our strategies for the protection of civilians still remain constrained by traditional national approaches. We need to continue to adapt and strengthen our tools and approaches to deal with such new emerging threats, and to become more proactive in identifying them. We also need to ensure our ability to respond quickly and effectively, as well as to develop more coherent and coordinated approaches to the protection of civilians in armed conflict. Although it is the primary responsibility of each State to protect its own citizens, we must admit that host States quite often fail to fulfil their obligations, owing either to a lack of resources or, unfortunately, to a lack of political will. In that regard, we urge the Security Council to be mindful of all violations of international humanitarian law and to make sure that all of the relevant resolutions dealing with the protection of civilians are fully implemented. Most important, we need to promote the continued development of both international and national accountability mechanisms that could better deter such violence against civilians, end impunity and ensure that all victims have effective and timely access to justice. That also includes more consistent application of the United Nations due-diligence policy, so that we can ensure that we develop the proper vetting mechanisms for the partners and actors whom we support and so we do not end up reinforcing actors who are responsible for violations of human rights and violence against civilians.  Over the past decade, the United Nations has made significant progress in enhancing its capacities to provide protection to civilians whose lives are in danger, as the Council has shifted peacekeeping well beyond its traditional role of monitoring the implementation of peace agreements. Today's peacekeeping missions are multidimensional and are more often mandated to play an active role in the physical protection of civilians. Although that United Nations function is critical in the early phases of United Nations interventions, we need to ensure, in parallel, that we build more sustainable and durable preventive measures in the longer term. In that regard, we need to develop more effective approaches to building State institutions, which will gradually decrease dependence on international support aimed at ensuring basic protection for civilians. Going forward, in order to ensure that national security institutions become more responsive, effective and proactive in protecting civilians, we must ensure that we build efficient, professional, responsive and accountable State institutions through a national security-sector reform process.  Slovakia strongly supports the full implementation of resolution 2151 (2014), on security-sector reform. We have to revisit the effectiveness of the security-sector reform processes that we are supporting and gauge whether we are in fact applying good practice in the area of security-sector reform.  First, the foundation of any security-sector reform process should be an inclusive approach and local ownership. Too often, we see that the most vulnerable groups, which are also the most susceptible to violence, and the most affected by insecurity are also marginalized in the process of shaping, managing and overseeing security-sector reform. Representative and inclusive security institutions in which there is balanced staffing at the operational level, but also in management and in oversight capacities, should be promoted. That should include full consideration for strengthening the involvement of women in all aspects of the security- sector reform process, especially in management and oversight capacities.  Secondly, we cannot simply focus on training and equipping activities, but we must also focus on building effective oversight, management and accountability mechanisms. We are seeing, in places such as Iraq, Libya and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the international community has provided substantial support to building the capacity of State or even non-State institutions, that such capacity has been used to harm the civilian populations because there is no system of accountability or oversight in place to deter such institutions from abusing their power. Similarly, better trained and equipped military or police services have also sometimes proven to be ineffective, or without any noticeable impact on security, simply because the growth in capacity is not matched by a similar ability to manage and direct that capacity.  Thirdly, we need to review the skills and training that are to be expected from security personnel. In that regard, in addition to basic training, we need to ensure that we sensitize all security personnel, both national actors whom we help to train and peacekeepers whom we deploy, on the key concepts of human security. Such training also needs to integrate and mainstream the issues of human rights, child protection and gender.  In conclusion, I would like to emphasize the importance of ending impunity for violations of applicable international humanitarian law and human rights law as part ofa comprehensive approach to seeking sustainable peace, truth and national reconciliation. We believe that ending impunity is also an instrumental part of preventing future violations. In that regard, we would like to stress the need for a comprehensive, independent and impartial investigation of all abuses and massive attacks against civilians and the indiscriminate destruction of civilian infrastructure, in accordance with internationally recognized standards and procedures.

    " Thank you, Madam President, for convening this open debate on conflict-related sexual violence and for choosing this important topic as part of your agenda. May I also congratulate you on your dynamic and effective presidency of the Security Council this month.  The United Arab Emirates joins others in thanking the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on conflict-related sexual violence, and the briefers this morning for their thoughtful and important presentations. The United Arab Emirates further lends its voice in commending the work done by Zainab Bangura in her tenure as Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict.  It is ofparticular significance that we are convening this open debate under Jordan's presidency, as the Middle East faces a rising tide of extremism and unrest. In that light, we welcome Special Representative of the Secretary-General Bangura's upcoming mission to the Middle East, in the hope that her visit contributes to creating a region-wide strategy to address conflict- related sexual violence within the context of extremism. As ever, the United Arab Emirates stands ready to support the Special Representative of the Secretary- General in this critical mission.  As we are confronted by distressing accounts of rape, sexual slavery and forced marriage by extremist groups, we must also recognize that some progress has been made in a relatively short period of time. It is remarkable to reflect that it was only eight years ago that the Security Council formally recognized the use of conflict-related sexual Violence as a matter of international peace and security. The crime itself has been used as a weapon of war for centuries, but it was here, in this Chamber, that the international community created the mechanisms to help national authorities confront perpetrators and support the victims of these crimes. And it is here where further progress can and must be made.  Today, the Secretary-General's report (S\/2015\/203) takes us a step further as we move away from looking at conflict-related sexual violence as a tactic of war, to recognizing it as a tactic of terror. The report accurately pinpoints how sexual violence is deployed by extremist groups to achieve their heinous objectives. As such, it should be firmly dealt with under this rubric ofterror. In this context, we fully endorse the Secretary-General's recommendation to integrate the issue of conflict- related sexual Violence into the work of the relevant Security Council sanctions Committees, as part of the designation criteria for the imposition of targeted measures. We believe that the Security Council has a key role to play and should remain actively seized of this matter, in the interest of maintaining international peace and security.  As the Secretary-General noted in his report, the rise of non-State actors has made our landscape much more complex. We are navigating a newly shifting security context where the rise of violent extremism has led to increased and targeted violence against women and girls, men and boys. Extremist groups and non-State actors are using sexual violence to achieve tactical objectives and terrorize communities into compliance, displacing populations and generating revenue through trafficking, enslavement and ransom. We need to develop more creative and innovative solutions as part of a comprehensive strategy. While the international community develops its responses to counter these acts, we must at the same time develop preventive approaches to empower women as their own first line of defence. This includes promoting women's participation in the design and implementation of these programmes and supporting their leadership in local contexts. The education and empowerment of women are our strongest weapon against extremism and conflict-related sexual violence.  In the larger context of conflict, this agenda must be pursued comprehensively. A full-fledged response to combating conflict-related sexual Violence will be possible only with the full implementation of the objectives outlined in 1325 (2000) in practice and not simply in theory. We must emphasize and ensure that women's agency and participation are an equal focus of this agenda in order to address its underlying causes.  As many have noted here today, accelerating the deployment of women protection advisers and gender advisers is key to addressing conflict-related sexual violence effectively. These differentiated roles are both of importance and must be given equal weight and resources. Let us commit to making the deployment of both gender and women protection advisers a key requirement of every mission.  Accountability for perpetrators is also fundamental to our global strategy. This should include individuals who commit, command or condone - by failing to prevent or punish - conflict-related sexual Violence. We need to ensure comprehensive justice strategies in line with international humanitarian and human rights law, which includes providing survivors with the full array of support needed after a crime has been committed.  Our attention, however, should focus not only on the aftermath of these crimes, but also on preventing their occurrence in the first place. To this end, we would like to share specific recommendations arising from the panel discussion series convened by the United Arab Emirates in partnership with UN-Women and the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, in contribution to the global study on resolution 1325 (2000).  First, we are better armed and better equipped to respond to conflict-related sexual violence when we have accurate data. We welcome comprehensive reporting, investigation and documentation in order to bolster the United Nations ability to better fulfil its mandate, stressing the need for sex and age-disaggregated data. It is critical for the international community to deepen its information base on the nature, scope and objectives of sexual violence carried out within conflict in order to define appropriate interventions in consultation with women and affected communities.  Secondly, in peacekeeping operations it is critical that missions be able to predict emerging threats, react quickly and efficiently to instances of violence and understand community needs in their response. Digitizing early-warning mechanisms enables women and girls to protect themselves from conflict-related sexual violence. This requires cooperation among local communities and peacekeepers, as well as additional funding to expand the use of early warning tools as part of a preventive approach.  Thirdly, victims need to be able to safely and effectively report and document sexual assault in conflict zones.  In one recent mission, under the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, mobile technology was utilized to allow civilians to register reports of violence directly to United Nations peacekeeping forces. This kind of reporting and documentation needs to be supported by the increasing presence of women protection advisers, who are deployed in peacekeeping operations to prevent and respond to conflict-related sexual Violence.  Fourthly, crowd-sourced information can improve women's voice and agency in peace processes. Improving women's access to information and avenues through which they can share their views helps ensure that women are part of important discussions about political processes, peacemaking and community development as countries transition out of conflict.  All of these recommendations approach tackling this issue in new ways and building on utilizing the tools that have proven effective. We need to continually improve our methodology by using new technology to help us address this centuries-old crime.  It is the responsibility of the international community and national authorities to promote gender equality and empower women, not simply because it is the right thing to do, but because we know it leads to more stable and secure societies. As such, the United Nations remains the central forum for addressing this matter. Much progress has been made through the continual, concerted efforts of Special Representative of the Secretary-General Bangura, the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict, United Nations Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, among other United Nations entities.  To that end, last month the United Arab Emirates Government contributed $1 million to United Nations Action's multi-donor trust fund specifically to support the important work being undertaken by the Team of Experts in their efforts to build capacity on a national level in the rule of law and justice sectors. The United Arab Emirates stands with the United Nations and international partners in this important endeavour and hopes 2015 will be the year where we place the agency and participation of women and girls front and centre in our agenda. This is not only an issue of gender, but also a matter of international peace and security.  ",
    " At the outset, we would like to thank you, Madam, for convening today's meeting and express our gratitude to the guest briefers for their participation in it and their assessment of the current situation in the fight against sexual violence in armed conflict.  Separately, we recognize the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Ms. Zainab Hawa Bangura, whose actions have brought about considerable progress in work in this area.  We have carefully studied the report prepared for today's meeting (S\/2015\/203), which attests to the great amount of work done by the Special Representative in the past year. Unfortunately, the problem of sexual Violence remains relevant, particularly in individual conflict situations where such crimes are widespread. Such situations require attention from the Security Council. At the same time, we support the activities of a range of other bodies of the United Nations system that, within their remit, are engaged in the subject of sexual Violence in broader terms. The Security Council should not duplicate these efforts.  We note the report's definition of conflict-related sexual Violence. As such, the report departs from the terminology of the Security Council resolution on this issue, beginning with resolution 1820 (2008), and diverges from the very language of today's debate on sexual violence in conflict. Such attempts to revise previously agreed language and in general to broaden our approach to the subject are of concern to us.  Issues related to the struggle against sexual Violence in armed conflict should be seen as one component of the entire range of measures to achieve conflict resolution and post-conflict recovery. Women and children frequently fall victim of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including the indiscriminate or excessive use of force. They suffer from terrorist acts and become refugees and internally displaced persons. As a result, any discussion of the women and peace and security agenda in the Security Council must be comprehensive and include such issues as countering sexual Violence as a way of fighting other forms of crime against women, as provided for in resolution 1325 (2000). The perpetrators of such crimes must, after due investigation in accordance with the requirements of international law and national legislation, be brought to justice. The section of the Secretary-General's report on the problem of sexual violence in the context of violent extremism is crucial. The danger of this scourge has become increasingly serious. A year ago, we were witness to the tragedy in the Nigerian city of Chibok, where terrorists from the Boko Haram group kidnapped 276 school girls. Many of these girls have yet to be found. Regrettably, this example is not unique. Such crimes must be stopped.  Sexual violence in armed conflict cannot be fought without the active involvement of national authorities in the process. There is a reason why the Secretary-General's report focuses in particular on the need for national involvement and the assumption of leadership roles and responsibilities by States. Contacts with non-State armed groups must be carried out in accordance with Security Council resolutions and other regulatory instruments of the United Nations. We appreciate the approach of the authors of the report, who have specifically addressed a considerable portion of the recommendations in the fight against sexual violence to national Governments. Gains in the Secretariat in this area, such as the guidance note on reparations for conflict-related sexual Violence, serve as frameworks for States to use, taking into account their national specifics and legislation.  With respect to the matrix of early warning indicators of sexual violence, we are cautious with respect to such indicators, particularly since sexual violence in and of itself is far from always being a source of emerging armed conflict. On balance, we believe that the recommendations of the report should focus on approaches that have been worked out and approved within the United Nations and not on those that advance other initiatives or instruments elaborated by a limited number of participants without the support of decisions taken by United Nations bodies.

    " I would like first to commend the Spanish Presidency of the Security Council for convening this open debate on women and peace and security on the occasion of the high-level review of resolution 1325 (2000). Despite the advances and good practices that have been developed with respect to that resolution, obstacles to its effective implementation remain. In that regard and with a view to preventing violence against women, Peru enacted a law to equalize gender opportunities between men and women and adopted a national gender-equity plan, as well as a national plan to combat violence against women.  Similarly, the Ministry of Women and Vulnerable Populations has developed a registry of internally displaced persons, which has made it possible to protect the rights of women and girls in conflict and post- conflict situations. Likewise, through a law enacted in 2005, my country established a comprehensive reparations plan for the victims of acts of violence that occurred between 1980 and 2000. The national plan to combat violence against women incorporated the topic of sexual violence in the context of armed conflict, calling for its inclusion in regional policies throughout the country. The plan calls for the inclusion of all forms of sexual violence within the ambit of the comprehensive reparations plan, in particular that inflicted on women victimized during the period of terrorist violence.  At the international level, Peru supports the Secretary-General's zero-tolerance policy, which strongly condemns the participation ofpersons working under the flag of the United Nations in any form of inappropriate or immoral behaviour, especially in cases of sexual exploitation and abuse against civilians, in particular women and girls.  Moreover, my country welcomes the trend towards the systematic incorporation of a gender perspective in the mandates of peacekeeping operations, as well as the integration of women as actors in the prevention and resolution of conflicts. For that reason, Peru has increased the participation of women in each of the eight missions in which we participate. Women currently represent 10 per cent of our staff deployed on the ground, a figure that we hope to increase in the future.  Peru looks favourably on the inclusion in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (General Assembly resolution 70\/ 1) of a Goal designed to achieve gender parity and the empowerment of women and girls. In that regard, we believe that the challenge that we most urgently need to address is the implementation of measures to achieve full respect for women and girls in line with resolution 1325 (2000), through which the international community recognized the pressing need to offer specialized training on the protection, special needs and human rights of women and children in situations of conflict around the world.  In that regard and in the light of the current high- level review to assess progress in the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) at the national, regional and international levels, Peru commits to work with other States to address the remaining problems in that area, with the goal of achieving a peaceful environment in which all women, without exception, are able to lead full lives free of any form of abuse, in particular in contexts of violence and conflict, where they are most vulnerable. Similarly, by way of reaffirming my country's commitment to supporting this important topic and agenda, Peru sponsored the resolution adopted this morning (resolution 2242 (2015)), which paves the way for the path to be followed in the coming years with regard to the agenda of women and peace and security.  ",
    " Allow me at the outset to congratulate you on your country's assumption of the Presidency of the Security Council this month and to thank you, Sir, for convening this debate of highest importance on women and pace and security. I also thank you for affording us the opportunity to meet today, not only to celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000) but also to take stock of the progress made to date, as well as to define the gaps and challenges that remain to be addressed and to renew our commitments.  The historic adoption 15 years ago of resolution 1325 (2000) recognized the role that women play in matters of peace and security, not only as victims but also as agents of change and indispensable actors in the re-establishment, maintenance and consolidation of peace. That resolution enabled us to make significant progress towards women's autonomy, particularly in conflict situations, by developing national action plans with quantifiable indicators and through the implementation of follow-up mechanisms. Since the adoption of that resolution, a number of new commitments were undertaken, aimed at according greater political recognition and stronger emphasis to the question of women and peace and security in political discourse. Six other Security Council resolutions have contributed to developing that political framework and to promoting positive norms. The adoption of all those resolutions sends a strong message with respect to the firm and continuing commitment of the international community to advancing women's independence and to protecting their rights.  Despite some signs of progress, the impact on women's lives and on their role in the world has been sporadic. Conflicts have devastating consequences for everyone, but women and girls are often the target of gender-based violence and are those most excluded from the political processes that are essential to guaranteeing peace and security. Because women are the most vulnerable and the most frequently targeted members of populations in situations of conflict, they have an undeniable and unique contribution to make to peace negotiations. Members of the Council will note that the experience of both Haiti and West Africa has proven that, when women are involved in peace processes, they have been able to bring their sensitivity and creativity not only to the peace process itself but also to national reconciliation efforts and the process of socioeconomic reintegration.  Conflict prevention is an essential element of the women and peace and security programme. Women's perspectives on the tensions in social relationships, their awareness of threats to personal, social and community safety, their knowledge of the flow of small arms and light weapons in the heart of communities, and their interpretation of extremism in local discourse help shape the primary mechanism for rapid response and early warning when conflict is imminent; yet they are rarely heeded or taken into account by the local authorities tasked with security. Conflict prevention is a central pillar of the programme for women and peace and security. Since 2000, however, prevention has unfortunately failed to receive the same degree of sustained attention as post- conflict problems such as the reconstruction of State security services.  Resolution 2122 (2013) recognizes that lack of attention and aims to promote the role of women at all levels in conflict prevention, resolution and recovery. The resolution has filled a gap in interpretation, which was formerly focused only on the prevention of gender-based violence during conflicts rather than on preventing conflicts themselves. It is therefore necessary to follow a more comprehensive and holistic approach that tackles the root causes of conflicts, and not just their impact on women, girls, men and boys.  The establishment of genuine peace in society requires healthy and inclusive political, economic and social structures. Local women's organizations are drivers in promoting women's empowerment and their effective participation in political, economic and social life. My delegation endorses the recommendations set out in the Secretary-General's later report (S\/2015\/716), in particular those that encourage equal and timely access to basic services, putting an end to discriminatory laws and practices, strengthening the rule of law, ensuring equitable economic development and maintaining a space for civil society.  Women and girl refugees and internally displaced persons continue to be victims of violations of all sorts. Regional dialogues with refugee women, which are regularly organized by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, show that undocumented women and girls continue to suffer from the worst acts of gender-based discrimination, in particular in terms of access to health-care services, education and other social services. Women and girl refugees and internally displaced persons who are fleeing violence and fighting find themselves once again at risk of sexual exploitation, rape, prostitution and forced marriage, pregnancy and sterilization. Even worse, they are now auctioned and sold in slave markets.  Member States must comply with their international obligations and register the refugees who are present on their territory. That will ensure the empowerment of vulnerable women and their active participation in national and regional institutions for conflict prevention. In addition, it is important to allow broad participation by all internally displaced and refugee women in decision-making processes in order to not leave them simply in the hands ofpolitical organizations or criminal groups.  By way of conclusion, allow highlight the following observations.  Strong political will and the full commitment of Member States to the provisions of resolution 1325 (2000) will enable the active participation of women in national, regional and international institutions for the prevention, protection and management of conflict situations.  The participation of women in peace efforts is a matter of gender equality and respect for universal human rights. It is crucial to achieving lasting peace, economic recovery, social cohesion and political credibility. Women should be encouraged to become further involved in issues of peace. Their contribution is necessary to establish lasting peace. They must be involved at every stage of the efforts undertaken to restore the rule of law and rebuild societies through transitional justice. Their voice must be heard and their rights protected. We must eliminate stereotypes in order to guarantee the effective participation of women at all stages of the peace and decision-making processes.  Enhancing the empowerment of women allows them to meet their basic needs and reduce their working hours, and thus to have more time and space to become involved in the process of managing local conflicts. That will also contribute to strengthening social stability.  ",
    " The second statement by the representative of Ukraine proved once again that he does not understand the subject of today's debate. It is not Ukraine and not the situation in Ukraine.  ",
    " At the outset, Sir, allow me to thank your delegation for having brought such an important issue for discussion before the Security Council. The most important Security Council resolution on the role of women in peacebuilding and conflict prevention is now 15 years old. The Republic of Paraguay joins the commemoration of the adoption of the landmark resolution 1325 (2000). The resolution is important not only because it is the first to point out the inextricable link between gender equality and the participation of women in international peace and security, but also because it recognizes the particular impact of armed conflict on women and the role they play in peace processes and post-war rehabilitation.  The Republic of Paraguay, which has participated actively in peacekeeping operations since 1993, reaffirms its commitment to prevention, protection and the participation of women before, during and, where necessary, after conflicts. In this regard, the Government of Paraguay, taking into account its international commitments to contributing to peacebuilding and the need to integrate the gender perspective into conflict prevention, management and resolution, recently finalized its national action plan, which will allow it to implement the mandates set out in resolution 1325 (2000). The national action plan, which will be officially released later this month, is the fruit of the efforts and coordination carried out by various national institutions since 2012, including the Ministry of Women, the Ministry of National Defence, the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, with the valuable support and continuing assistance of UN-Women, of which we are a faithful ally.  In 2015, our country has enjoyed the highest percentage of female participation in awareness programmes and training for peace operations. Some 27 per cent of participants are women, and we hope to see this percentage increase through the efforts of the relevant institutions to promote the greater participation of women in the contingents of peacekeeping missions in which Paraguay is a participant. The main obstacles that prevent women's full participation in peacekeeping and peacebuilding can bee linked to gender-based discrimination and women's economic and social exclusion, situations that entail the denial of women's rights. That is why it is so important to work to strengthen women's human rights from a perspective that includes devoting attention to their economic, social and cultural rights.  Numerous experiences in conflict and post- conflict situations have proven that the exclusion of women from peace processes not only undermines the promotion and protection of their human rights but also reduces the probabilities of lasting peace and future development for all the citizens of a given country.  The inclusion of a gender perspective in every aspect of peacebuilding, including conflict prevention, management and resolution, requires, first and foremost, the political will to include women in decision-making processes. Without the participation of women there can be neither a gender agenda nor political decisions that reflect a gender perspective.  As we celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000), we call on Member States to ensure that all resolutions and initiatives on women and peace and security are implemented with specific measures that ensure women's effective participation in peacebuilding activities under equitable conditions.  ",
    " At the outset, I would like to align my delegation with the statement delivered earlier on behalf of the European Union and its member States. I would also like to thank the external speakers, and in particular Ilwad Elman for her powerful and insightful remarks on the situation faced by women and girls in Somalia. And I thank you, Mr. President, for including the vital voice of civil society in the Council.  Early intervention to prevent conflict is of course greatly preferable to dealing with its consequences. In that regard, Ireland warmly welcomed the adoption of resolution 2171 (2014) in August. We continue to work with colleagues in the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency Group on strengthening the Council's conflict-prevention perspective and encouraging it to take action at an early stage to prevent conflicts occurring. But sadly, conflicts do occur and civilians do get killed, wounded and displaced. Indeed, in many cases, civilian populations are deliberately targeted. And while the precise data has not been agreed on, there is no doubt that as technology and weaponry have advanced and the pattern of conflict has changed, it is civilians and not combatants who are suffering more and more from conflict. We therefore have to ask ourselves how the United Nations can best act to minimize the impact of conflict on civilians. There are no clear answers, but we believe it is important to look closely at the integration of human-rights priorities into peacekeeping mandates and operations, with a special consideration of the impact on women and girls.  We strongly support the thorough and ongoing implementation of the Secretary-General's Rights Up Front initiative. Breaches of human rights should always serve both as a warning sign for potential conflict and an indicator of the need to protect civilian populations. We welcome the increasing integration of human rights components into peace operations, especially as they concern women and girls. However, in many countries and regions, including, for example, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Nigeria, there are gross violations of human rights, and those whose rights are most grievously disregarded are disproportionately female. While of course the primary responsibility lies with the parties to a given conflict, there is, however, a crucial role to be played by the United Nations. Ireland believes that the knowledge, experiences and perspectives of women should be factored into all conflict and post-conflict discussions. We strongly support efforts to increase the numbers of women active in the policymaking, planning and implementation processes related to international peace and security, and notjust in particular conflicts but also in relation to disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control.  The United Nations must show leadership here and play a more directive role in order to ensure that women are fairly and fully represented in conflict resolution and related processes. Like many other speakers, we also believe that gender advisers should be deployed in all United Nations peacekeeping operations and special political missions, and we call for the further deployment of United Nations women protection advisers.  The protection of civilians affected by conflict should be at the heart of United Nations peace operations. We look forward to the review currently under way, focusing on how the protection of civilians can be made a central part of the mandates of all peace operations and ensuring that those charged with implementing the mandates have the necessary tools and support. For the United Nations to be credible in protecting civilians, troops deploying to difficult theatres to execute challenging mandates must have the ability, means and willingness to perform their task. We agree, for example, with the remarks made to the Council in October (see S\/PV.7275) by the Force Commander of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lieutenant General dos Santos Cruz, who stressed that all components of a mission must be proactive and ready to take action to protect civilians.  We must also acknowledge failures to protect civilians, such as those identified in the March 2014 report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services, which cited \"a persistent pattern of peacekeeping operations not intervening with force when civilians are under attack\" (A\/68\/787, summary). Some of those failures were due to poor leadership and a lack of accountability, which must be corrected. In that context, I am pleased to record that Ireland is providing funding to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to review command-and-control policy so as to address those and other issues. As a troop-contributing country of long standing, it is an issue that we have a strong interest in.  It would be naive to expect that conflict can be eliminated in the short term. It is therefore vital that the Council and the Organization deploy their best efforts to protect civilians, especially women and girls, who play no part in conflict, do not support it and just wish to avoid falling victim to it.  ",
    " I thank the Secretary-General for his briefing and for his efforts and measures to combat sexual abuse within the United Nations. France welcomes his determination and exemplary mobilization to take all the necessary measures to prevent and fight sexual exploitation and abuse in the United Nations.  Sexual abuse committed by Blue Helmets, both military and police, but also by United Nations civilian personnel and international forces that do not operate in the United Nations command, is unacceptable. That is why France supports the Security Council draft resolution on sexual abuse under consideration. It is also why France supports the efforts of the Secretary- General aimed at further strengthening the zero- tolerance policy through concrete proposals. A number of them have already been implemented; others are still being considered in other forums. These exchanges, this momentum, are positive and are encouraging with regard to the future of peacekeeping operations.  The zero-tolerance policy regarding sexual abuse must apply at all levels. First, at the level of the United Nations, it must apply on the ground. In peacekeeping operations, several operational measures will make it possible to change the daily lives of the local population: the repatriation of units suspected of sexual abuse, the appointment of focal points within peacekeeping operations to prevent sexual abuse, and efforts to improve support for victims. All these steps will contribute to changing the culture and reality of peacekeeping operations.  However, zero tolerance does not concern only the Blue Helmets. Unfortunately, among the civilian personnel of the United Nations programmes and agencies there have also been cases of sexual abuse, including by those who tend to the needs of the most vulnerable - refugees and displaced persons. That is why France calls for stepped-up vigilance and efforts to increase, through adapted infrastructure and means, the protection of these populations, often marked by extreme poverty and extreme weakness and are traumatized by the violence of conflict. We owe special protection to women and chilren, who are the first targets of various acts of abuse, violence and exploitation in camps and sites for refugees and displaced persons.  Zero tolerance must begin with its application at the level of the United Nations, but zero tolerance applies at the national level as well. It is the responsibility of every State to take the necessary steps to prevent sexual abuse and also to bring to justice those suspected of such abuse. That is what we do in France.  With regard to prevention, our security forces in France are systematically vetted regarding their history in terms of respect for human rights, in keeping with the policy required by the United Nations. Our security forces are also systematically trained on the protection of human rights and the fight against sexual abuse before deployment. France intends to strengthen its training and prevention system within the framework of its security forces. France is also pleased to announce that it will contribute to the financing of the office of the Special Coordinator on improving the United Nations response to sexual exploitation and abuse,special Ms. Jane Holl Lute. We warmly welcome her appointment. Regarding the fight against impunity, France deploys, as requested by the Secretary-General, national investigation officers within its contingents in order to respond rapidly to allegations. Furthermore, as soon as allegations were reported in the Central African Republic, French justice opened judicial proceedings to shed full light on the situation. Justice must be carried out ifthese allegations are confirmed, in a way mindful of the fundamental principles of the law and with respect for the independence of the judiciary.  Zero tolerance must also be applied at the regional level. Regional organizations are not, unfortunately, spared allegations of sexual abuse. That is why it is essential to act at this level as well, especially as those organizations are often key partners of the United Nations in peacekeeping operations. Thus we call on the African Union - which incudes countries that contribute troops to the United Nations and through its own missions acts both both upstream and downstream of the Blue Helmets - to strengthen its cooperation with the United Nations in these matters.  This public debate marks a movement for peacekeeping operations from which there is no turning back. They can no longer close their eyes and remain silent about sexual abuse. Today the Concil speaks publicly in order to break the silence and the stigmatization that burdens the victims so as to send them a message of hope.  Lastly, Iwould like to end on anote of encouragement and thanks for the tens of thousands of soldiers and police officers, from the United Nations or elsewhere, who are not implicated in the allegations and who put their lives on the line in order to save others. They should know that we do not wish to stigmatize them for the actions of others; on the contrary, we want to assure them that they can continue to do their work with the effectiveness it needs.  ",
    " At the outset, I would like to congratulate your friendly country, Sir, for presiding over the Security Council during the month December. We also thank you for convening this important debate. We also welcome the fact that His Excellency the President of the Government of Spain presided over the meeting this morning. We also welcome the Council's adoption of resolution 2331 (2016), which we co-sponsored.  Moreover, I would be remiss not to associate myself with the statement to be delivered by the representatative of Bahrain on behalf of the Group of Friends United against Human Trafficking.  The reports presented include appalling statistics on the spread of human trafficking. They also bear out the causal relationship between conflict and the spread of human trafficking. A look at the ongoing conflicts all over the world and their abhorrent repercussions, leads us to conclude that forced migration is fundamental to those conflicts, which have pushed hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes in search of greater security and a life of dignity. We have all seen the painful images of those who have paid their lives due to the exploitation of refugees by human traffickers.  While we highlight the important measures undertaken by the international community to address trafficking in persons, the real challenge facing us is not limited to promoting frameworks and means to combat the phenomenon. Instead, we should address the root causes that have led to such exacerbation. We are talking about protracted and new conflicts that have pushed innocent civilians to seek safety and peace. They are therefore prone to danger in their own countries, which are suffering from poverty and conflict, or are in situations of displacement or are seeking asylum or are migrating to other countries in order to flee death and destruction. Adding to the dangers associated with the phenomenon of human trafficking is the use by terrorist groups of young people who are recruited to carry out terrorist operations.  While referring to the horrific repercussions of conflicts and policies that violate the fundamental rights of individuals and peoples, we would also like to stress that conflict provides an environment conducive to human trafficking. The international community has failed to address those conflicts and crisis that indirectly contribute to the further spread of this phenomenon.  The friendly people of Syria have paid a very high price owing to the failure of the Security Council to save civilians and reach a solution to the crisis in their country, which is now in its sixth year. The appalling and unprecedented humanitarian crisis in Syria has unfortunately been exacerbated in Aleppo, where an increasing number of civilians find themselves in situations of forced migration. The many security and other repercussions of this situation will have an impact on regional and international peace and security.  Furthermore, we would like to stress that, should the international community should succeed in putting an end to human trafficking, we would still need to address the root causes and find just solutions to conflicts and crisis, fight impunity and ensure accountability.  The State of Qatar has supported the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons since its inception. We have enacted many legislative measures aimed at combating trafficking in persons. We have also cooperated internationally and promulgated laws that criminalize the human-trafficking phenomenon. In 2015, we hosted the thirteenth United  Nations Conference on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. The Doha communique that was issued following the Conference endorsed a comprehensive approach to combating the crime of human trafficking. We are also one of the major supporters of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, which is the primary United Nations agency operating in this field. In same vein, we have been one of the main contributors to the United Nations Trust Fund for Victims of Human Trafficking since its establishment. In conclusion, the State of Qatar will spare no effort to support the efforts of the Security Council to put an end to the phenomenon of human trafficking and to all conflicts and crises and bring about peace and security in our region and the world at large.  ",
    " We thank the Russian Federation for having convened this debate, and the Secretary-General and the two briefers for their unflagging commitment to this issue.  When it comes to peacebuilding, the international community's record this past year is uninspiring. Not since 1945 have there been so many displaced persons, many of whom are women and young girls. Armed conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Iraq are ongoing, causing immense suffering to their civilian populations. In these challenging times, it is essential to promote partnerships with civil society, and in particular with women's networks. Colombia is a perfect example of the role that civil society women's networks can play in peace and peacebuilding efforts. In that regard, I thank the NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security and all affiliated organizations for their tireless efforts to promote the women and peace and security agenda here in New York.  Switzerland's national action plan is a Government instrument that contemplates a participative mechanism designed specifically for civil society. This year will see the third review of that plan. In that regard, civil society organizations have drafted an alternative implementation report. Switzerland will consider its conclusions when it updates the national action plan in 2017. Reports on the implementation of the national action plan are regularly submitted for parliamentary oversight. As for the fulfilment of the commitments undertaken last year, we would like to highlight three points.  First of all, in order to support political dialogue in Libya and the process of drafting the constitution, Switzerland has facilitated women's discussion groups. Thirty-eight women's groups of different backgrounds negotiated and drew up a peace programme, which they launched at a high-level meeting in Geneva in November 2015.  Secondly, non-State armed groups must be considered in the implementation of the agenda on women and peace and security. Switzerland continues its efforts to facilitate direct dialogue with those groups, which must recognize the principles of international humanitarian law and commit to respecting existing rules, including those regarding sexual and gender-based violence. In that connection, Switzerland supports the Women's Initiative for Gender Justice, a non-governmental organization that aims to rehabilitate and reintegrate former child soldiers of the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda and victims of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo by providing psychosocial support and access to medical assistance. The project also contributes to holding perpetrators of sexual and gender-based violence accountable under national and international law. For example, the documentation of sexual and gender-based violence that was made possible through this project was used against two Congolese rebel leaders at the International Criminal Court.  Thirdly, sexual and gender-based violence is a major, pressing issue. Accordingly, Switzerland will make sexual and gender-based violence a priority in its humanitarian commitments. That will include fostering access for victims to various services, mainstreaming the topic in the various areas of humanitarian aid and supporting partner humanitarian organizations in their work in the area of sexual and gender-based violence.  Switzerland continues to be one of the major donors to UN-Women and has increased its contribution to CHF48 million Swiss for the period from 2015 to 2017. Earlier this month, we also inaugurated the new UN- Women Liaison Office at Geneva. As the Secretary- General stated, Member States continue to shoulder the primary responsibility for implementing the agenda for women and peace and security. Switzerland is ready to embrace that role and renews its commitment to the women and peace and security agenda.  ",
    " At the outset, my delegation extends to the Russian presidency our great appreciation for convening this open debate on the very important theme of women and peace and security.  My delegation appreciates the efforts made by the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, in promoting the mainstreaming of gender equality and empowerment. We welcome the briefing he gave this morning, as well as that delivered by the Executive Director of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, Ms. Phumzile Mlambo- Ngcuka. We also take note ofthe briefing made Ms. Rita Lopidia, Executive Director of the EVE Organization for Women Development in South Sudan.  Uganda joins other Member States in reiterating  the concerns the international community continues to have in the effective implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). Women continue to face numerous challenges, but most specifically their plight is even more debilitating during conflicts and wars. More often than not, they are not the causes but mere victims and bear the greatest brunt ofthe excesses of such conflicts. Women and girls have endured some of the greatest acts ofhumiliation by being subjected to such degrading acts as rape and other forms of sexual violence and abuse during conflicts. In most instances, sexual exploitation, violence and abuse are even used as weapons of war. United Nations reports are awash with many such acts in many conflicts and war situations all over the world, including in Africa. Conflicts and wars have registered many widows and orphans, the most vulnerable of whom are girls. In the same vein, women continue to be sidelined and marginalized in conflict management and resolution, peacemaking, peacebuilding, peacekeeping and peace support operations.  We commend the United Nations for some deliberate actions taken so far to address those challenges and for the implementation of some aspects of resolution 1325 (2000). However, a lot ofwork still needs to be done. We therefore call for the full and effective implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). We note with appreciation the recognition of the Secretary-General in his report (S\/2016\/822) of Uganda as an outstanding example of a country that has demonstrated that women are making a remarkable difference as agents of change. In local districts under the localization programme, Uganda, facilitated by the Global Network of Women Peacebuilders, has adopted local action plans that have resulted in a decrease in sexual and gender- based violence.  The question of sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping operations must be seriously addressed and those who commit such crimes should be held to account for their actions. Uganda is exemplary in that respect. Not long ago, some Uganda People's Defence Force members serving in the African Union Military Observer Mission in Somalia were identified for transgressions and were duly tried before a court of law, both in the Mission area and at home. Those found culpable were severely punished for their actions.  In order to address the question of gender balance and gender mainstreaming in a holistic manner, Uganda has made tremendous strides in empowering women and girls through not only the provision of universal primary and secondary education, but also the introduction of affirmative action in admissions to tertiary institutions in the country. That has greatly enabled more women to acquire the necessary education that empowers them with the required skills and knowledge to compete with men in various aspects of life, both internally and globally.  In politics and governance, more women have been able to be elected to the national legislature and other Government legislative institutions due to the deliberate Government policy of affirmative action of reserving certain positions for women alone, in addition to their ability to compete with men in other positions. More female members have also been appointed to the national Cabinet in Government. The Government of Uganda is committed to continue exploring more opportunities in the effective implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). We wish to call upon the United Nations to involve more women in preventive diplomacy, negotiations and mediation to promote gender balance in these areas.  Last but not least is the question of gender budgeting that must take into account the special needs of women in the domain of peacekeeping and support operations. Working together through and within the United Nations system, we should continue to promote the equal and effective participation of women in all efforts aimed at the promotion of peace and security. ",
    " At the outset, allow me to express our strongest condemnation for the heinous and cowardly terrorist attack perpetrated in Lahore, Pakistan, yesterday. We firmly stand in solidarity with the Government and the people of Pakistan in their fight against terrorism.  I would like to express our appreciation to the Angolan presidency for organizing this timely debate on the theme of women and peace and security, with a special focus on the role of women in conflict prevention and resolution in Africa.  Last year was a landmark year for gender equality and the women and peace and security agenda. We not only celebrated the twentieth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, but we also marked the fifteenth anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000). The high-level review of the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), along with the review processes carried out by the High-level Panel on Peace Operations and the Advisory Group of Experts on the Review of the United Nations Peacebuilding Architecture, yielded a sound foundation to reflect on an international framework of cooperation concerning conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peacebuilding, with a strong emphasis on the empowerment of women. The United Nations reaffirmed its firm commitment to strengthening the role of women in conflict prevention and resolution with the adoption of resolution 2242 (2015).  The severe effects of conflicts on women and girls in various locations across the globe continue to constitute a significant challenge that needs to be addressed. Furthermore, our world is now facing the largest humanitarian crisis since the Second World War, with an increasing influx of displaced populations due to protracted conflicts and the lack of security and stability, which gives rise to even further difficulties to vulnerable groups, including women and girls. Moreover, the horrific acts perpetrated against women and girls by terrorist organizations, such as Boko Haram and Da'esh, demonstrate the need for a comprehensive strategy for countering violent extremism and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.  African women and girls are not immune to the difficulties and challenges I have just described. On the contrary, during times of conflict and insecurity, there is no doubt that African women suffer the most as victims of widespread sexual and gender-based violence. Yet during hard times, women also play a primary role in building and supporting peace. We are cognizant of the fact that women in Africa have been enablers of economic development, peace and social solidarity. It should be underlined that overall stabilization and development efforts in Africa cannot succeed if women lack security and access to political, economic, social and judicial formal and informal settings.  In that context and within the framework of a multifaceted African partnership policy, Turkey encourages increased political and social participation, as well as the economic empowerment of women on the continent. To that end, Turkey implements joint projects at the multilateral and bilateral levels with the African Union and African countries for the capacity-building of women in socioeconomic development. Turkey also attaches importance to the efforts aimed at promoting and advancing the women and peace and security agenda in Africa. To mention one recent example, Turkey co-hosted with the Somali federal Government and the United Nations an event on women and peace and security at the margins ofthe High-level Partnership Forum: New Deal Somalia, held in Istanbul from 23 to 24 February. The meeting included the participation of international partners and women leaders from the central and regional Governments of Somalia and civil society representatives. The participation of the First Ladies of Turkey and Somalia, who delivered closing speeches at the event, added a strong voice to the cause of African women.  In conclusion, I would like to underscore that Turkey will continue to work with African partners and the international community to ensure women's active involvement in sustaining peace, stability and prosperity in Africa.  ",
    " I offer my condolences and those of my Government to the people of Germany, Turkey and Russia for yesterday's terrorist attacks. There is no justification for terrorism.  This debate and resolution 2331 (2016), adopted this morning, as Ms. Nadia Murad Basee Taha reminded us in her moving briefing, takes place 12 months after the Security Council's first debate on this item (see S\/PV.7585), convened by the United States. The holding of this meeting reflects the importance that the international community attaches to the issue, but it also lays bare the tremendous challenges we still face. As obvious as it may sound, human trafficking is a crime, tragic and brutal in its disproportionate effects on the most vulnerable: women and girls, migrants, refugees and internally displaced persons. If any conclusion can be reached today, it is that, as the Secretary-General said, prevention must be one of our priorities.  Preventive strategies, such as actions to prevent terrorism and violent extremism, cannot be developed in isolation. We are facing a phenomenon that requires joint, collaborative responses based on international cooperation, with full respect for human rights and in the framework of agreements on the protection of civilians, and must be supported by civil society.  With a long internal conflict like ours, we in Colombia have understood that women and girls play a fundamental and proactive role in the prevention and resolution of conflicts, as well as in building stable and lasting peace. That is why we must ensure their rights in a safe and supportive environment. In the peace agreement that is starting to be implemented, with the support of the Security Council, guaranteeing the rights of women and girls has become a common purpose in the work of all the institutions that have been collaborating and incorporating a gender perspective into their various programmes. Legislation, particularly law No. 1719 of 2014, condemns and specifically addresses the crime of human trafficking committed during armed conflict.  In 2016, the Secretary-General, in his report on conflict-related sexual violence (S\/2016\/361), underscored that, of all peace processes referred to in the report, only Colombia has systematically addressed gender issues, pursuant to resolution 1325 (2000) and resolution 1820 (2008). That is especially true regarding reparations for suffering, particularly providing for compensation and restitution, but also with regard to ensuring non-recidivism and to preventive measures, notably by creating and promoting a culture free of all forms of violence and discrimination, in keeping with international obligations.  Colombia is facing an enormous challenge, but it will continue to make strides towards our common purpose.  ",
    " Let me start by conveying my condolences to the delegation of the Russian Federation following the tragic death of Ambassador Andrey Karlov, which took place as the result of a terrorist attack in Ankara. (Spoke in English)  We also express our sincere condolences to the delegation of Germany in connection with the barbaric terrorist attack that took place yesterday in Berlin, which claimed the lives of innocent people.  At the outset, I would like to thank the Spanish presidency for convening this open ministerial debate on trafficking in persons in conflict situations, in connection with the agenda item \"Maintenance of international peace and security\", as well as for the concept note on the topic (S\/2016\/1031, annex). Azerbaijan is strongly committed to combating trafficking in persons and other related criminal offences. We share the concern over the scale and number of such challenges. The situation has recently deteriorated owing to increased violence, terrorist activities and humanitarian crises.  Azerbaijan is a party to the relevant international and regional instruments, including the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children and the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. In implementing its international obligations, Azerbaijan has adopted a comprehensive legal framework for effective action against human trafficking and has developed a national action plan aimed at defining the key responsibilities of the competent State bodies and at strengthening and facilitating their coordination. Furthermore, an inter-agency task force, led by a national coordinator, and a specialized police unit within the Ministry of Internal Affairs have been created. Additionally, the national system for the identification of and support to trafficking victims has been established.  In recent years, the need for more international attention and redoubled efforts aimed at combating trafficking in persons has significantly increased. In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Member States committed to taking immediate and effective measures aimed at eradicating and ending modern slavery and human trafficking. In its presidential statement of 16 December 2015 (S\/PRST\/2015\/25), the Security Council particularly noted that trafficking in persons undermines the rule of law and contributes to other forms of transnational organized crime, which can exacerbate conflict and foster insecurity. We are concerned that civilian populations are often viewed by armed groups as resources or commodities to be trafficked in, according to the report of the Secretary- General (S\/2016\/949) and the presidency's concept note. As the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, noted in his latest report (A\/HRC\/32\/41), conflicts are prolonged by actors who take advantage of situations of lawlessness to reap personal gain through lucrative activities, such as trafficking.  The international legal framework for combating human trafficking is based on the rules operating within the relevant branches of international law that ensure protection in all situations, including in armed conflicts. Success in fighting criminal activities during conflicts, including human trafficking, requires, first and foremost, strong commitment to the relevant binding obligations, as well as resolve to put an end to unlawful situations and to ensure that dispute settlement and conflict resolution do not serve to prolong and sustain such trafficking. Dispute settlement and conflict resolution must be based on respect for and strict compliance with international law. It is also essential to address conflict-related violations and abuses of human rights through all available means. Strengthening both international and national justice responses are critically important in order to ensure accountability for human trafficking in armed conflict.  ",
    " Belgium would like to thank the Russian delegation for convening today's debate. We would also like to thank Ms. Mlambo-Ngcuka, Executive Director of UN- Women, and Ms. Rita Lopidia, Executive Director of EVE Organization for Women Development, for their briefings and their presence today.  Belgium fully aligns itself with the statement delivered by the observer of the European Union. I would like to add the following observations in my national capacity.  At the outset, I would like to pay tribute to Ms. Fatoumata Sire Diakite, late President and founder of the Association for the Progress and Defence of Women in Mali, who passed away on 14 October. She was recognized as Woman of the Year in Mali in 2015 and was honoured by numerous awards. Ms. Diakite opened the way for Mali to recognize the rights of women in every domain - the fight against female genital mutilation, child marriages and gender-based violence. That woman serves as a model who can inspire all of us.  An open debate (see S\/PV.7533)was held a year ago on the occasion of the fifteenth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000). It was the most well-attended debate in the history of the Security Council, with 113 speakers over a two-day period. The vast majority ofMember States co-sponsored resolution 2242 (2015). That overwhelming participation clearly shows the importance that Member States attach to the women and peace and security agenda. It is indeed a matter that concerns us all. Our priority can now be summed up in three words: implementation, implementation, implementation.  Today's debate focuses quite rightly on progress achieved in implementing the commitments undertaken by Member States, regional organizations and the United Nations in the high-level review of women and peace and security in October 2015. Since the outset, Belgium has strongly endorsed the women and peace and security agenda. Currently, at the national level, all Belgian stakeholders are focusing their efforts on implementing our second national plan of action for the agenda. We are also in the process of drafting our third plan, in which we will give particular attention to women's key role in preventing violent extremism. We are ready to share our experience in this field and welcome with interest all the experiences and best practices that our partners are willing to share.  At the international level, Belgium works closely with multilateral organizations, such as UN-Women, to strengthen national capacities for the implementation of the women and peace and security agenda. In our current National Action Plan, we have identified three priority partner countries - Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Mali - to which we provide financial assistance for the financing of specific projects. In Mali, together with UN-Women, Belgium co-chairs the donor group devoted to the issue of gender equality and has contributed \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.5 million to the programme to support the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) in the peace process. In Afghanistan, Belgium has supported the UN-Women country programme with a contribution of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3 million. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Belgium has contributed \u00e2\u201a\u00ac2 million for the implementation of the UN-Women programme entitled \"Support for the law and the participation of Congolese women in the context of resolution 1325 (2000)\".  At the invitation of Spain, Belgium became a founding member of the Women, Peace and Security Focal Points Network. We thank that country for its initiative in that regard. We also wish to salute Spain and the United Kingdom as co-chairs of the Informal Expert Group on Women and Peace and Security for their invaluable contributions, and we are pleased to see that group of experts pursue its work on a consolidated basis.  The Russian presidency has also asked us to think about next steps in promoting the women and peace and security agenda. I would like to make three very concrete recommendations: First, we urgently need to increase the active participation and representation of women in all political, justice and peace processes. Indeed, many studies have shown that women's participation increases the effectiveness of humanitarian aid, the credibility and quality of peacekeeping operations, the speed of economic recovery in post-conflict situations and the sustainability of peace agreements.  Secondly, in the fight against sexual violence in conflict situations, the fight against impunity is of paramount importance. This year is the tenth anniversary of the Brussels Call to Action to Address Sexual Violence in Conflict and Beyond. In the outcome document of that international symposium, held in June 2006, participants committed themselves to  \"intensify international, regional and national efforts to end impunity for perpetrators by strengthening the legal and judicial systems and by enacting and enforcing legislation, and provide national justice systems with the necessary resources to prosecute cases of sexual and gender- based violence\".  Belgium supports that appeal with determination and actively contributes to current efforts to pursue the so-called Islamic State - also known as Da'esh - for its crimes, especially those committed against the Yazidi community.  Thirdly and finally, the women and peace and security agenda should be integrated into the thematic work of the Security Council on counter-terrorism, even when it comes to countries where groups such as Boko Haram or the so-called Islamic State are active, and into country strategies in line with commitments made in resolution 2242 (2015).  In conclusion, I would like to invite all participants to attend an event tomorrow morning entitled \"From Local Action to Global Change - Bottom-up Approaches on Resolution 1325 (2000) from Iraq, Libya and Kenya\", co-chaired by Costa Rica and my country, Belgium, and organized by the WO=MEN, Women Peacemakers Programme, PAX and Cordaid associations, It will provide an important opportunity to illustrate the important role of civil society in the implementation of the women and peace and security agenda.  ",
    " As Chair of the MIKTA Group for 2017, Turkey has the honour to deliver the following statement on behalf of the MIKTA countries, namely, Mexico, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Turkey and Australia.  At the outset, we would like to express our appreciation to the French presidency of the Security Council for organizing today's open debate. We also thank the Secretary-General for his recent report (S\/2017\/861).  The MIKTA countries welcome the continued attention paid to the women and peace and security agenda at the Security Council. We recognize the key role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peacebuilding. We underscore the importance of their equal participation and full involvement in all efforts in the maintenance and promotion of peace and security. We also believe in the need to increase the role of women in decision-making on conflict prevention and resolution.  In that regard, let me note that all MIKTA countries are members of the Group of Friends for Gender Parity. The MIKTA countries believe that achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls are critical to conflict prevention, as well as the broader efforts to maintain international peace and security. That is also key for the fulfilment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  We consider resolution 1325 (2000) to be an important milestone for addressing the impact of armed conflict on women and girls. Successive Security Council resolutions have also contributed to the establishment of a sound, normative framework in that regard. We attach importance to ensuring collaboration and coordination through the United Nations system in the implementation of those resolutions and continue to encourage more women to participate in the United Nations peacekeeping process and missions. Despite the progress achieved so far, we still face daunting challenges. Women and girls continue to be disproportionately affected by the impact of conflicts around the world. In that context, we are alarmed by the targeting of women and girls by gender-based violence, in particular rape and other forms of sexual abuse, in situations of conflict. Such appalling acts deserve to be condemned. The MIKTA countries also attach importance to the efforts to improve the United Nations system-wide approach to preventing and responding to sexual exploitation and abuse.  Massive forced displacements caused by the devastating effects of conflicts continue to be a source of grave concern. Women and girls face severe consequences in humanitarian crisis situations. The MIKTA countries are committed to promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls. It is imperative to develop gender-responsive humanitarian polices that ensure that women and girls have access to basic services, including health and education. It was encouraging to see that gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls emerged as an overarching theme of the commitments made at the first World Humanitarian Summit, held in Istanbul last year. It is important to transform such commitments into action. It is also crucial to redouble our efforts to prevent women and girls from becoming victims of human trafficking in conflict and post-conflict situations. We can achieve meaningful progress on that front only through coordinated and consolidated measures.  At a time when the causes and effects of conflicts easily spread across borders, regional and international coordination and cooperation remain important tools in addressing the challenges we face. With that understanding, MIKTA, as a cross-regional group of countries on different continents, underscores its readiness to contribute to international efforts for taking forward the women and peace and security agenda.

    " Sweden aligns itself with the statements to be delivered by the observer of the European Union and the representative of Norway, on behalf of the Nordic countries.  Combating brutal human rights violations by trafficking in persons must be a priority for us all. It is our common responsibility. Sweden remains strongly committed to eradicating all forms of trafficking in persons. We would therefore like to congratulate the United Kingdom on organizing this ministerial open debate. Today's debate is important for many reasons. First, we need to ensure that this issue remains on the global agenda. Today's discussion builds on the momentum created under the Spanish presidency of the Council. Secondly, we need to move forward with actions in line with resolution 2331 (2016). Finally, trafficking in persons is a transnational threat that requires a transnational response. The United Nations provides a unique forum for achieving this goal.  Human trafficking and various forms of slavery are flourishing. This is due to ongoing conflicts and massive displacement of civilian populations, such as the situation in the Lake Chad basin region, which the Council visited two weeks ago. It flourishes because there are those ready to cruelly exploit others in desperate situations. The most effective way to end human trafficking is to address its root causes. The root cause is demand. For example, should there be no persons - the majority of them men ~ ready to buy sexual services ,there would be no trafficking for sexual exploitation.  Another root cause, of course, is conflict and displacement. We need to prevent them, as we heard not least in the excellent briefing on Somalia. We have to prevent them before they occur, and we have to invest in equitable sustainable development for all. These are important measures to combat human trafficking. Existing international obligations relating to human trafficking and forced labour must also be fully implemented.  The Council has an important role to play in prevention, including through the sustaining peace agenda. In addition, peace operations mandated by the Council must see the role that organized criminal groups, as well as terrorist groups, play in perpetuating the unstable situations and conflicts that lead to human trafficking, and in human trafficking itself. Working on the ground to create accountable and effective security sector institutions can enhance the capacity of Member States to address these groups.  As the Secretary-General has previously reported, there is a clear nexus between conflict- and post- conflict-related sexual violence and human trafficking, such as sexual slavery, forced labour and organ removal. The list is long. I will, however, focus on sexual exploitation predominantly targeting women, and girls and boys.  The effects of trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation are different from the harm caused by trafficking for other forms of exploitation. Recognizing that human trafficking has a clear gender dimension is therefore essential. All actions against trafficking should have a gender approach.  Sweden wants to stress the importance of not creating legal markets for human traffickers. There is an ongoing discussion within the United Nations and elsewhere about whether prostitution should be viewed as a profession. The term \"sex worker\" is often used in these discussions. Swedish policy on this issue is clear. Prostitution can never be regarded as ajob; prostitution is exploitation. Sweden urges more countries to consider legislation that targets the person who buys sex and offers support to the person being exploited, thereby shifting the criminal focus and guilt from the person being exploited to the exploiter. Knowledge about one's own rights, including about sexual and reproductive health and rights, is crucial.  Another essential element is accountability in conflict and post-conflict environments. Sweden strongly supports the implementation of the United Nations zero-tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse.  As Chair of the Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict, we would also like to stress the particularly vulnerable situation of children in this regard, and also highlight the forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflicts as one of the worst forms of child labour. Target 8.7 of the Sustainable Development Goals asks us to eliminate this and we need to keep a strong focus on achieving this goal. We should also focus on Goal 5, on gender equality, and on the other relevant Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Sweden is also proud to be a pathfinder country in the United Nations Global Partnership to End Violence against Children. It is a critical initiative, and Sweden would like to urge more countries to join it.  Finally, we must enable women and girls to make decisions about their own bodies, lives and futures in all contexts. We must engage more women both in peacebuilding activities and in action against trafficking. By implementing the agenda on women and peace and security, we can ensure that women's voices, experiences and solutions are brought to the table. Gender equality is about human rights. ",
    " I was born a refugee during a chemical-gas attack in Kurdistan. Thanks to my mother. I was also born a feminist. After spending the first 15 years of my life in camps and asylum centres, I am now dedicating my life to working with and empowering other refugee women and girls. I am speaking today in my capacity as founder and Director of Women's Refugee Route and on behalf of the NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security. I am speaking here in complete safety. Yet many displaced women and girls do not have that luxury, especially since one in five of them have been raped or experienced other forms of sexual violence.  Sexual violence is a gender crime used to shame, demonstrate power and reinforce gender norms. It sustains fear and insecurity. The stigma associated with sexual violence prevents many survivors from reporting abuse, accessing medical and psychosocial services and seeking justice. I want to focus on the need for gender-sensitive support for refugees and the critical importance of empowering refugee women. I also want to highlight the urgent need for programmes that cater to all populations at risk, including refugees with disabilities, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) individuals, and men and boys.  More than 65 million people around the world have been displaced from their homes as a result of persecution, conflict or human rights violations, often intensified by the flow of arms. In times of crisis, women and girls are at a heightened risk for all forms of gender-based violence, from rape to assault, domestic violence and early marriage, as well as exploitation by smugglers. Displaced women and girls also experience disruptions to their education and livelihoods and often have to take drastic measures to survive. Women have told me that they have engaged in prostitution for as little as a couple of euros in order to be able to feed their families. One woman in particular has stayed in my heart ~ she was the same age as me and had to sell her body to buy milk for her baby.  I founded my organization when I realized that international humanitarian responses to refugee populations were largely gender-blind. For example, a woman I worked with at a refugee processing centre wanted to report her violent husband. I went with her to help translate for her, but the shelter insisted that she speak using their interpreter, who was a man. She did not feel comfortable doing that and cancelled the meeting. In every refugee setting I have worked in, there is a huge lack of trained women interpreters, volunteers and specialized service providers for dealing with survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, and a lack of understanding of the ways in which services must be adapted if they are to be gender-sensitive.  The fear of stigmatization and of breaches of confidentiality also compound access issues. I met a 17-year-old woman who had fled the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham and been raped by soldiers at a border crossing. She left her family so that she would not have to tell them what had happened, and continued on her own. She was too scared and ashamed to report the rape and so received no medical assistance until she reached her final destination in Northern Europe, where she gave birth. That is despite the fact that international humanitarian law says that donor aid must be delivered in a non-discriminatory manner that includes access to sexual and reproductive health care such as abortion. In Greece, I urged a 16-year-old unaccompanied minor from Afghanistan who had been gang-raped to report it and thereby get access to services. She refused, asking me what the point of reporting it was if the system would not protect her.  It is also very urgent that we address the protection needs of groups that are at risk. I recently met a refugee woman in a wheelchair who had to struggle even to maintain basic hygiene. She could not lock the shower once her wheelchair was in it, and she was too scared to take a shower when the door was open. The tools and guidelines to protect displaced women and girls from sexual and gender-based violence already exist. We need the political will to consistently implement them.  Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex refugees, because of their sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics, face an increased risk of discrimination and violence compared to the larger refugee population. Many flee persecution, but subsequently do not disclose their sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status to service providers out of fear of becoming the victim of more violence. Moreover, notions of masculinity prevent abused and at- risk men from admitting their vulnerabilities to sexual violence and from seeking support. My colleagues who work with refugee men also talk of the challenges encountered in getting those who were raped to report it. They say they need to \"remain men\".  Time and time again, I see humanitarian agencies working to implement standardized programmes instead of adapting responses to the survivor's concerns and needs. Yet, not all refugee camps and protection programmes are the same. Those where refugee women have been consulted in designing and implementing protection strategies are much safer. Refugee women are resilient. They have survived the unimaginable. When empowered to advocate for themselves and to be part of the decision-making on providing a safe environment and work opportunities, refugee women become the bedrock of peaceful and sustainable communities. Investing in women and women's organizations that support empowerment is critical.  Sexual violence in conflict does not happen in a vacuum. It is the result of systematic failures on the part of the international community to address the root cause of conflict, gender inequality and impunity. That must end. I call on the Security Council and all Member States to undertake the following: promote gender equality and women's and girls' empowerment as fundamental to all efforts to prevent and address sexual violence in conflict and support women's organizations working on the front lines; join and support the Call To Action on Protection from Gender-based Violence in Emergencies; ensure that the Global Compact on Refugees, to be completed in 2018, is progressive in meeting the needs of refugee women and girls; uphold the rights of all refugees by urgently improving access to international protection through humanitarian visas, increasing refugee resettlements, granting greater access to information and fair hearings; ensure that aid complies with international humanitarian law and is not subject to donor limitations, including the denial of sexual and reproductive health care, such as abortions; commit to programmes that are informed by gender analysis, meet the needs of all survivors and include sex- and age-disaggregated data, which must involve gender-sensitive training on working with survivors for all field workers and including survivors in consultations on their individual protection strategies; lastly, curb the flows of small arms by ratifying the Arms Trade Treaty and implementing it through enforced national laws and regulations.  It is not enough to condemn acts of sexual violence in conflict. Everyone here today is responsible for putting an end to such violence, bringing all the perpetrators to justice and putting women at the front and centre of all responses to prevent it.  ",
    " My delegation fully associates itself with the statement delivered earlier by the observer of the European Union.  We wish to thank you, Madam President, as well as France for taking the leadership in organizing this annual debate on women and peace and security. It is indeed crucial that the Security Council continue to systematically and consistently advance a holistic women and peace and security agenda in its work and decision-making, and we certainly do not take it for granted that 17 years after the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), we still have points to focus on. Indeed, we need to redouble our efforts to ensure that the resolution and our work really matter and that it is implemented in a manner that makes a difference for the people on the ground. I would like to thank the Chef de Cabinet of the Secretary-General, Ms. Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti, for her briefing, and the other briefers for their very insightful, very practical and extremely interesting contributions to today's debate. In particular, I would like to acknowledge the significance of UN-Women and the importance that this entity plays in making sure that there is stronger engagement with the Member States, and with the Security Council in particular.  Furthermore, we would like to commend the Secretary-General for his report (S\/2017\/861), but, more important, for his strong commitment and leadership related not only to the issue of gender parity but also specifically to the women and peace and security agenda, pursuant to the recommendations and commitments made at the 2015 high-level review, in the global study on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) and in resolution 2242 (2015). We welcome and strongly support the Secretary-General's vision of peace and security grounded in long-term conflict prevention, inclusivity and gender equality, as well as his victim- centred approach to preventing sexual exploitation and abuse. I would add that we were very happy to see that the Secretary-General decided to spend United Nations Day with people on the ground, in particular in the Central African Republic, where these issues are perhaps more important than in other parts of the world. That focus is certainly very much appreciated.  I would like to welcome the practical innovations at the level of the Security Council, such as the convening of experts in the Informal Expert Group and the inclusion of women civil-society representatives in country-specific briefings. At the margins of the general debate of the General Assembly, new initiatives on gender parity and conflict prevention were launched in which my country also participated. The second meeting of the Women, Peace and Security National Focal Points Network took place in September with an important focus on conflict prevention, the security sector and its integration in national action plans and national strategies on women, peace and security. Also, the heads of the armed forces of approximately 100 Member States met at the United Nations this year to discuss the issue of increasing the number of female peacekeepers and integrating the gender perspective.  As the French delegation stated in its concept note (S\/2017\/889, annex), despite the substantial efforts undertaken to implement the women and peace and security agenda and the progress that has been made in the past 17 years, critical challenges remain, ranging from increasing the number of women at the highest levels of decision-making to ending impunity for gender-based violence. Moreover, gender-responsive and protective environments for women remain lacking, and women, peace and security efforts continue to be unpredictably undervalued and underfunded. These are areas where we believe we need to further enhance our concerted efforts.  We are of the View that four of the themes of the women and peace and security agenda - participation, conflict prevention, protection, and relief and recovery - need accelerated attention and action by the United Nations and its Member States. I should also like to highlight other critical areas, such as disarmament, efforts to create greater space for women's civil-society organizations and the need for stronger information and analyses on women, peace and security. The current refugee challenges create specific environments for women, and further action is necessary to address women's lives in those conditions. Last but not least, it is of the utmost importance that we collectively make progress on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDGs 5 and 16, while recognizing gender equality and peaceful, just and inclusive societies as global development priorities.  Slovakia is currently in the process of drawing up its national action plan on women, peace and security. Meanwhile, the Government continues to promote all national efforts aimed at strengthening the role of women in society through the national gender- equality strategy for the period 2014-2019 and the gender-equality action plan. In addition, the Ministry of Defence has approved its own gender-equality plan, with its implementation under the responsibility of the general staff of the armed forces and with sustained, allocated funding.  As one of the Chairs of the Group of Friends of Security Sector Reform (SSR), Slovakia wishes to re-emphasizethatthisparticularaspect-security-sector reform - is essential to post-conflict peacebuilding and to creating the conditions needed for reconstruction and development. At present, the United Nations supports a rapidly expanding range of field missions aimed at assisting national and regional efforts in SSR, particularly at the sector-wide level.  Resolution 2151 (2014), on security-sector reform, underscored the importance of women's equal and effective participation and full involvement in all stages of the security-sector reform process. I wish to stress that gender-sensitive security-sector reform is key to developing security-sector institutions that are non-discriminatory, representative of the population and capable of effectively responding to the specific security needs of diverse groups. A United Nations approach to SSR must be gender-sensitive throughout its planning, design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation phases. Security-sector reform must also include the reform of recruitment processes and improvement in the delivery of security services so as to address and prevent sexual and gender-based violence. There is a need for sharper focus on developing gender-sensitive SSR strategies and achieving tangible results in the field. With that aim in mind, my country is planning to host a workshop in New York in early 2018 specifically dedicated to the issue of gender in relation to the SSR strategies.  In conclusion, the United Nations is facing unprecedented challenges to global peace and security. Civilians, most of all women and girls, are paying the highest price in the face of systematic violence and oppression. We all need to redouble our efforts to deliver changes on the ground in favour of women and girls, in particular in societies in conflict-affected areas.  ",
    " At the outset, I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for organizing this debate. I also thank Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed for her briefing. Let me also congratulate Ms. Pramila Patten on her appointment as Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict. I wish her success in her endeavours and take this opportunity to assure her of Turkey's firm support for her mandate. We also commend the work of the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict.  The severe effects of the conflicts in various regions today, especially on women and girls, continue to constitute a significant challenge that needs to be addressed. Unfortunately, the annual report (S\/2017\/249) of the Secretary-General on conflict-related sexual violence once again reveals a daunting picture. The current trends and emerging concerns pertaining to the increased use of sexual violence as a weapon ofwar and terrorism require a robust international response. We welcome and support the Secretary-General's strong emphasis on the importance of prevention. We also agree with his approach that preventing sexual violence is an integral part of wider conflict prevention.  When used or commissioned as a tactic of war or as a systematic attack against a civilian population, sexual violence significantly aggravates the severe effects of an armed conflict. Perpetrators continue to employ sexual violence, mostly combined with other crimes, such as killing, forced displacement, arbitrary detention and torture. In fact, the nexus between conflict-related sexual violence and terrorism, human trafficking and organized crime has become more pertinent than ever.  With that in mind, the despicable acts perpetrated against women and girls by terrorist organizations, such as Da'esh and Boko Haram, deserve every condemnation. The use of sexual violence, including the sale and trade of women and girls, as a tactic of terror by Da'esh in Iraq and Syria reflects the appalling nature of that terrorist organization. While Turkey continues to fight against Da'esh with all its means, we believe that it is high time for the international community to act in unity for a comprehensive and inclusive approach to eliminate the root causes of this menace. Although in a different context, it is also befitting to underline that the terrorist organization the Kurdistan Workers' Party\/Democratic Union Party (PKK\/PYD) likewise resorts to abuse and exploitation of women and children. The terrorist leadership of the PKK\/ PYD is known to commit sexual violence and abuse, even towards its female recruits. That includes rape, forced pregnancy and abortion and the carrying out of sexual-abuse related executions.  We are witnessing new complexities around the nature ofconflicts. The increasing number ofprotracted conflicts, forced displacement and humanitarian emergencies create an environment conducive to the trafficking of women and girls. Trafficking often involves sexual violence and exploitation. Turkey attaches the utmost importance to the fight against human trafficking, which constitutes a violation of human rights and an offence to the dignity and the integrity of the human being. In that regard, we recall the importance of resolution 2331 (2016), which Turkey co-sponsored.  As the crisis in Syria enters its seventh year, sexual violence continues to be used by various parties as a systematic tactic of warfare, terrorism and torture. Millions of Syrians, particularly women and girls, continue to live under the threat of sexual violence. The horrific acts of sexual violence perpetrated in the detention facilities run by the Syrian regime have been documented in various United Nations reports. In that context, Turkey's efforts pertaining to the release of detainees and prisoners by the conflicting parties within the framework of the Astana talks are all the more relevant.  Furthermore, as a neighbouring country, we continue to follow an open door policy with regard to Syrians fleeing war and violence in their own country - there are now over 3 million Syrians living in Turkey. Empowering and ensuring self-reliance, notably of Syrian women and youth, without any bearing of sexual and gender-based violence, is of crucial importance for us. That is why we exert every effort to provide security and safety for them.  Last but not least, I would like to underline that Turkey attaches the utmost importance to strengthening the efforts aimed at implementing the zero-tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations personnel. In that regard, we commend and support the Secretary-General's efforts towards making zero tolerance a reality. ",
    " At the outset, I want to point out that Germany aligns itself with the statements to be delivered by the observer of the European Union and the representative of Canada, the latter of whom will be speaking on behalf of the Group of Friends of Women, Peace and Security.  But let me first of all thank France for hosting today's open debate, and especially for putting a renewed focus on the implementation of the women and peace and security agenda.  1 would also like to thank the Chef de Cabinet of the Secretary-General and the Executive Director of UN-Women for their insightful briefings. I thank Ms. Mina-Rojas for speaking about the participation of women in the Colombian peace process. We also greatly appreciate Ms. Jean's provision of practical examples of women's leadership. It is very much welcomed that the International Organization of La Francophonie is participating in this debate.  Today's debate places a much welcome focus on concerting action and commitments. I would like to put forward four specific ideas on how we can step up implementation ofthe agenda ofresolution 1325 (2000).  First, we need to support practical initiatives to translate the rhetoric about women's participation in peace processes into action. As the Executive Director of UN-Women mentioned - and I want to thank her for it - Germany has decided to back the African Union in developing a network of African women leaders that provides women leaders from across the continent with a platform for exchange with respect to their experiences. The network, launched in June in New York, and is already producing results. Women leaders from across Africa are starting to share experiences about their respective activities and initiatives through the network. Its next meeting will take place in Addis Ababa next spring.  Germany fully backs the initiative led by Ghana and the African Union to establish a Group of Friends of the African Women Leaders Network in New York. The network needs our political support, and the Group can play an important role in that regard. We also welcome the fact that, under the leadership of the Deputy Secretary-General and the African Union Special Envoy on Women, Peace and Security, several women leaders conducted their first joint African Union-United Nations solidarity mission this summer, to Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We hope that more such solidarity missions will follow in future.  Secondly, we need to continue the international discussion on the implementation of the women and peace and security agenda between the annual open debates. Spain has set up a network of capital-level focal points on women, peace and security, and it is encouraging to see that more than 60 countries from all regions have appointed focal points. Germany will take over the chairmanship of the network in 2018, followed by Namibia in 2019, and we will host its next meeting, in Berlin, next spring. We hope that many delegations will be able to send a focal point to Berlin and use the opportunity to continue today's discussion.  The Informal Expert Group on Women and Peace and Security of the Security Council has become an indispensable tool here in New York in keeping the Council's attention on women and peace and security between the open debates. It has alreay looked into four specific situations in 2017. We commend Sweden, Uruguay and the United Kingdom for their work in leading that Group and encourage it to continue its approach of looking at individual situations more than once, thereby following up on implementation.  Thirdly, we can do better in linking up the implementation of the Security Council's agenda on women and peace and security with other agendas, most important the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, but also the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. This year, Germany adopted its second-generation national action plan for the period 2017-2020, and we have tried to emphasize some of the interlinkages. For instance, in line with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women general recommendation No.30, our new action plan further strengthens the qualitative involvement of civil society organizations. Civil society representatives have strongly contributed to our second action plan, and we have created new consultation mechanisms for our engagement with civil society.  Finally, we need to take specific action to prioritize the implementation of the women and peace and security in United Nations peacekeeping. Peacekeeping missions need to have the necessary human-rights and gender expertise. Having gender expertise integrated into all mission components is not only nice to have, but is at the core of mandate-implementation and lasting peace and security. We therefore welcome the Secretary-General's initiative to launch a United Nations senior women talent pipeline.  However, as Member States, we must also do more to inform, motivate and nominate women for peacekeeping missions. Germany recently awarded five female peacekeepers for their outstanding service in peace operations. Their contributions to the success of those missions are essential, whether as the captain of the German frigate training the Lebanese Armed Forces as part of the mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, or as the military officer overseeing reconnaissance in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali or as human resource officers in Colombia. We also provide gender-sensitive and gender-specific training to third countries, for instance in Accra, and support United Nations police in their work to implement resolution 1325 (2000).  The Security Council's women and peace and security agenda remains a priority for Germany in the United Nations. The Council can count on Germany's support in putting the rhetoric on women and peace and security into action.  ",
    " Namibia welcomes the Security Council's decision to once again discuss the issue of women and peace and security as a standing agenda item. We are encouraged by the overwhelming support shown by Member States as evidenced in the large number of participants.  My delegation also aligns itself with the statement delivered by the representative of Canada on behalf of the Group of Friends of Women and Peace and Security. We would like to reiterate that Namibia, as the initiator of resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, remains committed to its implementation. We look forward to a time when women's contributions to peace processes are valued and respected equally.  In Namibia, the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) falls within the national gender policy framework, which includes a cluster on gender, peacebuilding, conflict resolution and natural disaster management. Its overarching objective is to increase and strengthen women's participation in conflict resolution, promote women's contribution to peacebuilding and involve women in natural disaster management, an emerging issue that resolution 1325 (2000) overlooked. The reviewed gender policy is complemented by other national policies aimed at mainstreaming gender and holding discussions on placing women on par with men, including in the Affirmative Action Act, the Inheritance Act and the Communal Land Act, among others.  Those policies have ensured that Namibia has been deploying women to all peacekeeping missions and has had to date one of the largest female police contingents at the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, the Sudan. We also had a women police contingent in Liberia. When one of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries, Lesotho, faced a political impasse last year, the SADC police contingent to that country was led by a Namibian woman who had previously served in Darfur. In addition, Namibia has seconded a woman to the Office of the African Union Special Envoy on Women, Peace and Security.  It is our belief that the significant presence of women peacekeepers in conflict and post-conflict areas has an added advantage of creating safer spaces for girls and women who have suffered sexual violence. Studies conducted by the United Nations on support for resolution 1325 (2000) have demonstrated that female soldiers often face different cultural restrictions than their male counterparts and are able to gain information from women and children. That ability to gain the trust of local populations should be considered a vital component of any peacekeeping operation.  The challenges to the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000) are many, and include a lack of awareness of the agenda, a lack of political will, compounded by entrenched biases not to promote women to positions of power, and a lack of capacity-building and financing for the agenda. Another challenge is simply cultural and traditional norms that serve to promote men to positions of power, while questioning the ability of women to lead, particularly in traditionally male fields such as the police, defence services and peacekeeping. Since those traditional norms are pushed by both women and men, we must encourage a culture in which both men and women believe it is vital to support the rise of women to positions of leadership.  The inclusion of women in early-warning, mediation and conflict resolution efforts are key to ensuring a successful peace and security agenda. Gender-specific provisions also need to be included in peace agreements. Much progress is still to be made in that, as in 2016 only half of peace agreements adopted contained gender-specific provisions.  We must also do more to prevent and condemn sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping operations. The role of peacekeepers is to protect civilians, not cause more harm or distress. In that regard, Namibia signed the voluntary compact against sexual exploitation and abuse, during the General Assembly high-level week in September, and we encourage others to do the same.  Namibia urges Member States to commit to nominating women for top-level positions in international and regional peace and security organizations. At the African Union, the Special Envoy on Women, Peace and Security, Ms. Bineta Diop, has been raising this matter in many forums. We encourage other regional and subregional organizations to nominate women, peace and security envoys. We urge troop- and police-contributing countries to identify and deploy female military experts in peacekeeping missions. Finally, we demand greater consideration of the women and peace and security agenda in the working procedures of the Security Council, both country-specific and thematic.  ",
    " At the outset, I should like to commend France for its initiative to convene today's high-level open debate. I am particularly grateful to you, Sir, for inviting me here to reiterate, for the second time, the crucial importance of the implementation of the provisions of resolution 1325 (2000), of 31 October 2000, as well as resolutions that have complemented it year after year.  Seventeen years ago, we agreed to turn obvious truths into words. Seventeen years ago, we agreed to recognize the importance of women's participation, on an equal footing with men, in the areas of crisis prevention, mediation and the maintenance and strengthening of peace and security.  Let us start by recognizing that women did not wait for the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) to translate these truths into action. We saw it in Liberia. Ms. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was one of those women who stood up to the warlords and mediated between the warring parties. We saw it in Bosnia. Within communities, women are always the first to seek reconciliation and return. We saw it in Rwanda. Women who had been physically harmed took the lead in reconciliation and reconstruction efforts at the local and national levels. In Mali, as everywhere else, when women get to the bargaining table, their influence is real and they achieve noteworthy results.  I am also thinking of the Ouagadougou Preliminary Agreement of April 2012, which was written by four women who had initially not been invited to speak. However, faced with their insistance and the value and content of their proposals, they ended up being admitted to the negotiating table - yes, admitted without having been officially invited.  Those are just a few examples among many that speak to the real capacity of women and all the forceful actions they take every day that contribute to peace and security and that are wrongly overlooked. And that is without counting the achievements of women engaged in peacekeeping operations. I remember listening with the greatest admiration to cohorts of women trained in  Ghana and Mali at the Pearson Peacekeeping Centre, whose closure in 2013 I bitterly deplore. How many resolutions, studies, meetings of independent high-level groups and groups of experts must there be before we do away with that abyssmal and unacceptable figure of 9 per cent of women participating in some 30 major negotiations over the past 25 years? I ask myself: What are we afraid of? Being more effective? It has been shown that women's participation increases by 20 per cent the probability of reaching a peace agreement that will last at least two years, and by 35 per cent the chances of reaching a peace agreement that will last 15 years.  We - international organizations, States and Governments, together with civil society-must commit ourselves resolutely to identifying and mobilizing women in a more systematic and coordinated way to sit at all negotiating tables and lead or take part in dialogues and national processes. That is also one of the central recommendations of the Abidjan seminar on the promotion of women's participation in peace processes in Francophone Africa, which we organized almost a year ago, in partnership with UN-Women and the Francophone Network for Gender Equality. Our countries, our networks are full of remarkable women. Let us mobilize them.  What are we waiting for to put an end to the derisory and unacceptable figure of 3 per cent of women participating as military personnel of United Nations missions? What are we afraid of? Being more productive? It has been shown that the presence of women in those sectors contributes to improving security forces and increasing the credibility of missions, especially in their dealings with the population. Women inspire confidence.  The Organisation internationale de la F rancophonie (OIF) holds fast to the commitment, undertaken at the Francophonie Summit in Dakar of 2014, to investing in women and young people, who are the vectors of peace and development actors. Our organization, which has been involved for more than 15 years in strengthening the French-speaking contribution to United Nations peacekeeping operations, is also mobilizing on the ground in order to encourage the participation of female staff in missions and to train security forces in women's rights.  I will insist in a few days on all of these points at the Peacekeeping Defence Ministerial in Vancouver, Canada. OIF will once again sensitize its members to that problem at the meeting that we are organizing in the framework of the Boutros-Ghali Observatory in late November in Paris, in partnership with the United Nations. I do not want to see us forget the rule of law dimension, because the banalization of excessive State violence against citizens, the climate of impunity and the persistence of areas of lawlessness also affect the women and peace and security agenda.  It is clear that we need to do more. We must do more for women's economic and social integration, because peace, stability and security also depend on shared and inclusive economic development. That is the message that I will bring in five days to Bucharest, where the World Forum of Francophone Women will be held under the the theme, \"Creation, innovation, entrepreneurship, growth and development: Women make their mark!\"  We also must do more to fund women and peace and security. What is the point of pleading our case if the sums granted to fragile States to address issues of equality between women and men still represent only 6 per cent of the total aid package and only 2 per cent of aid reserved for peace and security, not to mention the funding rate for local women's organizations, including women's rights organizations, which could be described as miniscule?  We must do more to guarantee the full recognition of all forms of discrimination and crimes against women, which are crimes against humanity. We must do more to end impunity. How can one imagine genuinely recognizing the role ofwomen as vectors ofpeace while leaving unpunished those who trample their bodies and dehumanize them? Year after year, resolution after resolution, we agree to put into words the horrors that are inflicted on women by men, even more cruelly and more systematically in times of hostilities, conflicts and war. It is primarily women who are targeted when men decide to annihilate a people or a nation. The abduction and rape of women, girls and little girls have become weapons of mass destruction and their bellies have become battlefields.  I cannot forget the tears of the seven year-old girl, her mother and all the women tortured by militiamen in the Goma region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where I visited in 2010. And what is happening these days? We see massacres in Kasai province and  hear stories of mutilated women, some of whom them pregnant, who are found disemboweled. It is unbearable.  I am thinking about what happened to women in the neighbouring countries of Rwanda and Burundi. I am thinking of the thousands of refugee women in the Niger, on the border with Nigeria, 70 per cent of whom have fallen prey to Boko Haram and been subject to the most horrendous attacks. Lest we think that it is merely a question of Africa, I would say that it is not. Barbarism and inhumanity know no borders, And when there are reports of sexual abuse by United Nations personnel, the facts are equally damning. The men in this Chamber today are commended for not looking the other way and for resolutely supporting us.  Today's meeting provides us with an opportunity to affirm a real desire to act together, to continue to act and to do more. Let us take up the challenge of ever-increasing consultation and synergy of efforts. This is what we decided, the four women leading, respectively, OIF, the Ibero-American General Secretariat, the Commonwealth and the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, which comprise 167 States and Governments, or 61 per cent of the world's population. This strategic alliance also exists to serve the women and peace and security agenda, because nothing without women is or ever will be possible.  ",
    "I thank the Security Council for convening this open debate on women and peace and security, with a keen focus on the sustenance of peace through women's political and economic empowerment. We consider this to be a matter of great importance. Accordingly, I am greatly honoured to deliver a statement on that premise and, in the same vein, express our appreciation to the Under-Secretary- General and Executive Director of UN-Women, Ms. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, for her insightful briefing and to Ms. Randa Siniora Atallah for speaking on behalf of civil society.  Studies have shown that including women in conflict prevention and resolution generally leads to a more secure peace, and it has become increasingly evident that no society has successfully transitioned out of conflict except when women were a part of the mainstream of that society. Furthermore, it has been eight years since we celebrated the tenth anniversary of the landmark resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, with many activities, including a similar open debate in this very Chamber (see S\/PV.6453), and other open debates in subsequent years. Yet women's participation in peace and security processes remains beset by obstacles, including, but not limited to, commitments that lack sufficient financial and political support. Despite the gains made in gender equality in the women's empowerment agenda, challenges involving inequities still abound.  To that end, it is the resolve of His Excellency Mr. George Manneh Weah, President of the Republic of Liberia, its Government and its people that we must collectively endeavour to invest in the meaningful contributions that women make in the prevention and resolution of conflict in order to realize a more peaceful and secure environment around the world. Let us all pay heed to the call of the Secretary-General for Member States to initiate national and regional review processes in the lead-up to the twentieth anniversary, in 2020, of resolution 1325 (2000). Before Liberia adopted its national action plan on that resolution in 2009, Liberian women had already been involved in peacebuilding. Therefore, the resolution gave only added impetus to the efforts that were already being exerted by the women of Liberia. Liberia remains unwavering in its unflinching practical commitment to achieving gender parity and upholding women's rights. What is even more captivating is that the commitments to implementing resolution 1325 (2000) have received a renewed boost from the dynamic leadership of President Weah. Those commitments are given priority in their respective institutional frameworks, including, but not limited to, the Government of Liberia's pro-poor agenda for prosperity and development, which will be launched on Saturday, 27 October in Ganta, Nimba county, Liberia by President Weah, including its revised national agenda policy and its peacebuilding plan.  The pro-poor agenda sets ambitious targets to enhance the inclusion of women and girls to reduce political, social and economic inequalities. President Weah is Liberia's feminist-in-chief, a HeForShe champion who has emphasized his advocacy for advancing women in political leadership through his appointment and support of women to occupy political positions. President Weah selected the honorable Vice-President of Liberia, Jewel Howard Taylor, as his running mate on the ticket of the Coalition for Democratic Change. He appointed the first woman in our history to occupy the position of Deputy Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Liberia, Colonel Geraldine Janet George. And he appointed a woman as Deputy Inspector General of the Liberian National Police, Colonel Sadatu Teage Reeves, just to mention a few. While we endeavor as a country to address the challenges besetting women's participation in peace and security processes, we want to commend nations that are leading by example, including those that have formulated strategies to increase women's participation in peace and security processes and improve their protection from violence.  In conclusion, on behalf President Weah, the Government and the people of Liberia, we commend the United Nations country team, in particular UN- Women in its leadership role, the Peacebuilding Fund, our international partners and all other stakeholders for their consistent support to the efforts of the Government and the people of Liberia to lift and empower women in all sectors of society. As a country, Liberia looks forward to strengthening support and encouragement through its alignment as a member of the Group of Friends of the African Women Leaders Network, the Women, Peace and Security Focal Point Network and the Group of Friends of Women, Peace and Security here at the United Nations.

    " Allow me to thank the Bolivian presidency for organizing today's open debate on the fundamental issue of implementing the women and peace and security agenda and the goal of sustaining peace through the political and economic empowerment of women. I also thank the Ministers of Sweden and the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Executive Director of UN-Women and Ms. Randa Siniora Atallah for their insightful statements this morning.  This debate gives me an opportunity to present in this forum -which remains the heart of the international peace and security architecture - several aspects relating to the recent steps taken by the International Organization of 1a Francophonie (OIF) with regard to the agenda item under discussion today. The Heads of State and Government of States members of la Francophonie met in Yerevan on 11 and 12 October for their seventeenth summit and adopted a new strategy for the promotion of equality between women and men, and support for the rights and empowerment of women and girls. The seventeenth summit of la Francophonie also made it possible to reinforce the cooperation developed with the United Nations, with the signing of a framework agreement for cooperation between the OIF and the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Ms. Pramila Patten.  That cooperation will favour political dialogue between parties to conflict for the protection and effective access of victims and survivors to justice, as well as the fight against impunity for perpetrators of violence. Such cooperation will also strengthen national legal frameworks and the adoption of concrete, multisectoral and coordinated measures to prevent such violence by addressing the root causes, in particular discrimination against women and girls.  In operational terms, la Francophonie supports the strengthening of women's participation in peacekeeping operations. In May, the OIF teamed up with the Police Division of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to train female senior officers for the United Nations Police Command. The objective of increasing the still-low number of female uniformed military and police personnel in peacekeeping operations is also on the agenda of the seminar organized today by the OIF in collaboration with the United Nations in a neighbouring room, with the aim of contributing to the effective implementation of the Declaration of Shared Commitments on United Nations Peacekeeping Operations to which the OIF has subscribed, as have the African Union, the European Union and NATO, as part of the Secretary-General's Action for Peacekeeping initiative.  Today we collectively reiterate consensus on two essential points. The first is that the women and peace and security agenda, while based on fundamental rights, remains central to the prevention agenda, as well as to the peacebuilding and sustaining peace agenda. Secondly, we have the satisfaction of already having a range of political, legal and even operational tools at the national, regional and international levels that could enable us to make progress on these issues. And yet it is clear to all of us that despite the progress that has been made, today we still have to say that we are a long way from our goal, considering that in 2017 the number of documented cases of conflict-related sexual violence actually went up by 56 per cent.  The Secretary-General of the International Organization of la Francophonie, Ms. Michaelle Jean, who spoke here in October 2017, during the last debate on this topic (see S\/PV.8234), asked a question that I would like to reiterate. \"What are we afraid of?\" Because what is actually at stake here is our ability to make profound changes to the foundations of our political and economic systems and to deconstruct the stereotypes that underlie the question that brings us together today. As we know, on the ground women show unparalleled resilience, strength and creativity in overcoming the physical, socioeconomic and political constraints that limit their lives. They are empowered and have proven their intrinsic ability to use their power for the common good every day. They undoubtedly contribute smiles and gentleness, as some speakers have already said this morning. As a woman, I take this reference to the feminine nature, while perhaps somewhat stereotypical, as a compliment. But if we are to make serious progress today or, as some have said, ifwe want to finally hasten the implementation of the women and peace and security agenda, we must move resolutely beyond the perception that women still have to be trained and empowered to play a role. It is interesting, by the way, that no one, in the Council or elsewhere, ever wonders whether the men who participate in these peace processes have been adequately trained, which, given the state of the world and with all due respect to men, would seem not always to be the case.  Some speakers have mentioned the inherent biases in the economic and social system that still determine women's ability not to be vulnerable but rather to be in a position when they no longer fear attacks and can control their own lives, like their male counterparts. Initiating the implementation of the women and peace and security agenda must therefore be part of all sectoral policies as a whole and at the heart of the decisions that determine them. It is only by dismantling the social norms that are the foundation of the devaluation of the role of women - the devaluation that enables men to legitimize the worst kinds of violence committed against women and girls during conflicts - that we can hasten the implementation of this agenda on every front: protection, education, economic participation and political power. That is also where we will make progress in striking a better balance so that we can perhaps begin to address the overrepresentation of men rather than the underrepresentation of women in some of these processes. There has been too little funding until now to enable that change to happen and it is time to speed that up both in terms of financing and partnerships.  ",
    " At the outset, let me say that Slovenia fully aligns itself with the statement to be delivered by the observer of the European Union.  Let me also commend Bolivia for organizing today's debate to highlight the role of women in peace and security. I would like to thank the Secretary- General for his annual report (S\/2018\/900) and express our appreciation for his commitment to the women and peace and security agenda.  The meaningful participation of women in conflict prevention, conflict resolution and peace processes is enabled through their effective political and economic empowerment, their access to resources and the realization and exercise of their fundamental rights. Their voices in politics, including in Parliaments and Governments, in the military, in business and the corporate world and in civil society lend credibility and sustainability to the measures that address security concerns at all levels. We concur on the need for improved data and measurements for monitoring trends and progress in the relevant areas.  Obstacles to women's political and economic participation contribute to prolonged insecurity and threaten solutions for sustainable peace. Sexual and gender-based violence continues to represent one such obstacle, and we must do more to hold perpetrators accountable. With regard to accountability, let me reiterate Slovenia's strong support for the International Criminal Court and the work done in previous years by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the Special Court for Sierra Leone.  I would also like to stress the need for an active role on the part of men in promoting the women and peace and security agenda, both with regard to the prevention and elimination of conflict-related sexual and gender- based violence and by promoting the meaningful participation of women in peace efforts.  Let me inform the Concil oubriefly about our national efforts. Slovenia's second national action plan on women and peace and security for the period 2018- 2020 will be adopted by the Government in the coming weeks. The new action plan is based on a review of the implementation of the first action plan and takes into account emerging challenges and trends. It encompasses activities in five thematic areas: the integration of a gender perspective, women's participation, the protection of women and girls and putting an end to sexual and gender-based violence in conflict, education, training and awareness-raising about women and peace and security issues, and accountability for conflict- related sexual and gender-based violence. The plan includes a monitoring and reporting mechanism, and we believe that it will improve our results in terms of the women and peace and security agenda. We are also working on a new directive for the Slovenian armed forces on the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000).  We have defined gender equality as one of our thematic priorities and a cross-cutting issue in terms of our international development cooperation and humanitarian assistance, and we are supporting projects on the empowerment of women in the Western Balkans, Lebanon, Jordan, Uganda and Rwanda. Those projects contribute to women's resilience by encouraging awareness-raising, education and employment, balanced representation and the promotion of economic and psychosocial empowerment.  Given the importance that my Government attaches to the women and peace and security agenda, we have decided to dedicate part of our biggest foreign policy event - the Bled Strategic Forum, which we host every summer - to marking the fortieth anniversary of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the twentieth anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000). We welcome the efforts of the Security Council's Informal Expert Group on Women and Peace and Security to stress coordinated and specific country- level action. We join others in encouraging the Security Council to pay due regard to the Group's work in its deliberations and outcomes.  In conclusion, let me reiterate the appeal of the Secretary-General for all of us to do more to close the gap between what we are saying in this Chamber and what we are doing outside of it in order to provide more space for women's participation and secure more resources, including financing. I assure the Council that Slovenia remains firmly committed to the women and peace and security agenda and to a comprehensive approach to its implementation.  ",
    " Belgium of course fully aligns itself with the statement just made by the observer of the the European Union, and I would like to add the following observations in my national capacity.  First, we would like to begin by congratulating Dr. Denis Mukwege and Ms. Nadia Murad Basee Taha, who were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of their fight against sexual violence as a weapon of war. Belgium has been fortunate enough to work closely with both Dr. Mukwege and Ms. Murad and remains firmly committed to supporting their cause.  The women and peace and security agenda has  been one of the pillars of our foreign policy for almost 20 years and will therefore also be an important priority during our forthcoming term on the Security Council for the next two years. It is essential that we continue to translate the Council's resolutions into concrete action.  Belgium shares the view of the Secretary-General on the importance of women's active participation in conflict prevention and resolution. That is why we advocate for more women at the negotiating table, in peace processes and mediation efforts - in Syria and Yemen, for example - as well as in elections. Peace agreements and processes that take into account women's voices and examine the impact of conflict on women are more sustainable in the long term, as many speakers before me have said. Women must be more involved so that they can become agents for peace in their communities and countries. In that regard, we would like to recommend some concrete actions.  First, the Council itself should listen more carefully to the voices of women, for example by increasing the number of statements by representatives of women's organizations during Council discussions on peacekeeping operations, and by meeting with women's organizations during the Council's country visits. Secondly, we need more women in peacekeeping operations and in security-sector reform. We must also continue to support gender advisers under current mandates. Thirdly, we must encourage women's participation in peace processes and agreements and consider how to involve them at an earlier stage of the process. Belgium hosted a seminar in April devoted to the issue in collaboration with the African Union.  Finally, we can all act at the national level. Belgium is currently implementing its third national action plan on women and peace and security. An example of concrete action within its framework is our support for a five-year civil-society programme in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on women's participation in conflict-resolution mechanisms.  ",
    " We thank the Bolivian presidency for the opportunity to once again address the very relevant issue of women's role and place in resolving the problems of our era. The situation in the world today is characterized by increasingly non-trivial forms of conflict and confrontation and it requires similarly non-trivial approaches to resolving them. Clearly the existing international toolkit is inadequate to an effective response to our emerging challenges. Once again, that forces us to consider the role that women can play in peacebuilding and sustaining peace. We believe that women, as one of the groups that are most vulnerable to the consequences of armed conflict and confrontations, are uniquely aware of the full force of conflicts and the harm they inflict on future generations and therefore attach particular importance to preserving the values of peace, goodwill and well-being. That is why we should not underestimate initiatives that are aimed at promoting gender equality in issues related to the maintenance of international peace, ensuring the safety and security of women and girls in armed conflict and preventing violence and abuse.  Belarus has always advocated for advancing the role of women in resolving a broad range of issues on the international agenda, and for equality and non-discrimination. We support the ideas outlined in the relevant Council resolutions, including its landmark resolution 1325 (2000). We have traditionally supported the efforts of the Secretary-General, UN-Women, other specialized entities of the United Nations and States themselves in combating violence and protecting women, especially in the context of the role that Belarus plays in international initiatives to combat trafficking in human beings. It is clear that in conflict and post- conflict periods, owing to the collapse of political, economic and social structures, high levels of violence and militarism can worsen the problem of trafficking and enslaving women and children, in regard to which the example of Nadia Murad, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime Goodwill Ambassador and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate for 2018, is a shining one. In that regard, Belarus has unprecedented practical experience and a high level of expertise in the field of assisting in global efforts to combat trafficking.  The gender aspect of the work of United Nations peacekeeping missions plays a significant role in the process of improving approaches to current challenges and threats. Belarus is seriously involved in the response to the Secretary-General's call for enhancing the role of women in peacekeeping. Belarusian women are serving successfully as military specialists in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. Belarus is also a member of the Circle of Leadership in the fight against sexual exploitation and abuse in United Nations peacekeeping operations established on the initiative of the Secretary-General. We believe that the voluntary compact on countering sexual exploitation that was signed by members of the Circle of Leadership will continue to serve as the basis for further efforts to combat the problem. Lastly, we should also note the critical importance of the preventive mediating role that women play in preventing armed conflict. Implementing mediation practices at the early stages of confrontations is an unquestionably effective factor in the maintenance of international peace and security.  ",
    " I congratulate the Plurinational State of Bolivia on its presidency of the Security Council and thank it for organizing today's open debate. I thank the Secretary-General and other briefers for their remarks and acknowledge the contributions made by the Executive Director of UN- Women and other representatives.  Sri Lanka firmly believes that it is the meaningful participation of women in the international peace and security agenda that will bring about change in the world. It does not suffice that women are present at the peace table merely to satisfy a superficial gender-balance requirement or to check a box on a management-reform achievements sheet. Women must be given the space to truly engage both at the peace table and beyond, and at all levels - as leaders, researchers, workers, penholders and agents of change. Sri Lanka has identified gender equality and women's empowerment as a priority area and is party to numerous relevant international conventions and declarations, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. My Government is currently working to achieve gender equality by enacting gender-sensitive laws and formulating related policies and action plans. Gender equality has been addressed through our Constitution's chapter on fundamental rights and by meeting treaty obligations, as well as by achieving the gender indicators in the Sustainable Development Goals.  Sri Lanka was one of the first countries in Asia to grant a universal adult franchise in 1931. Following that, we enacted laws in 1939 and 1945 to ensure free education for all at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels. Those positive policies, implemented over the years, have resulted in gender parity in education. The right to a free education is enshrined in the Sri Lankan Constitution, which also mandates compulsory schooling between the ages of five and 14. More than 60 per cent of university undergraduates are women. At the primary level, female school attendance is essentially universal, while it stands at 99 per cent for boys. Free health care was introduced very early after Sri Lanka gained its independence in 1948. Sri Lanka adopted a women's charter two years before the Beijing Platform for Action, and we already have in place a national plan of action for women.  For Sri Lanka, sustaining peace through women's political and economic empowerment - a subject that the Bolivian presidency has so carefully chosen for our debate today - is very close to our hearts. Sri Lanka is now in a post-conflict era, traversing a path of reconciliation and justice. Never has the political and economic empowerment of women been more vital to our peace and prosperity than it is today. The protracted and brutal armed conflict in Sri Lanka left 24 per cent of our female population widowed. Sri Lanka is aware that the protection and economic, social and infrastructural needs of women affected by war continue to require our attention. To that end, we have found it crucial to incorporate gender into our transitional justice process, as stipulated in resolution 1325 (2000). Our Government is focused on three priority areas of women's empowerment - economic enhancement and financial identity, the elimination of violence against women and engagement in public and political life.  The mechanisms and processes for achieving national unity and reconciliation are being conducted under the overall guidance of our office of national unity and reconciliation. Sri Lanka is also in the process ofimplementing peacebuilding projects, which involve joint programming with the United Nations Development Programme - along with agencies such as UNICEF, the United Nations Population Fund, the World Health Organization and UN-Women - to implement the joint United Nations programme on preventing and responding to gender-based violence in Sri Lanka, funded by UN-Women. One of the key target groups in our empowerment programmes is female-headed households, including war widows. A national secretariat for widows and households headed by women has been established in former conflict areas in order to serve target groups better.  Sri Lanka has addressed the issue of violence against women using three approaches - prevention, intervention and advocacy for the formulation of policies and laws. A toll-free help line has been established in the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs to receive complaints and provide redress to victims through referral services. Sri Lanka also launched a national action plan for human rights for the period from 2017 to 2021, which reiterates the need to achieve substantive equality, particularly in the economic, political and cultural spheres. In that regard, the Government has allocated a quota of 25 per cent of posts for women in local Government bodies. The Ministry of Women and Child Affairs has also set aside at least 25 per cent of budgetary allocations for projects for rural economic development for women's economic enhancement.  Sri Lanka is also working to reserve a minimum of 25 per cent of the representation in Parliament for women in the near future. In that regard, however, we are ever mindful of the challenges that women face when entering politics and the toxic atmosphere they encounter. Compared to men, they experience disproportionate personal scrutiny, discrimination, character assassination, violence and defamatory statements. Unfortunately, politics has become an inhospitable environment for women, and my Government is committed to fighting the root causes and institutional biases that prevent women from becoming fully empowered in their chosen fields.  Sri Lanka has demonstrated its wholehearted commitment to the elimination of sexual exploitation and abuse. It was one of the first countries to sign the Secretary-General's voluntary compact on eliminating sexual exploitation and abuse. The President of Sri Lanka has joined the Secretary-General's circle of leadership on the prevention of and response to sexual exploitation and abuse in United Nations operations, and we have made contributions to the Trust Fund in Support of Victims of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse.  Finally, for more than five decades, Sri Lanka has been making modest contributions to United Nations peacekeeping efforts. We are equally committed to the inclusion of our highly trained and disciplined female forces in peacekeeping efforts. As Sri Lanka proceeds with its reconciliation and peacebuilding process, with the active participation of women at all levels, we will continue to share our experiences and practices, especially in relation to the implementation of the women and peace and security agenda.  ",
    " Ithank you, Mr. President, for putting this item on the agenda. I would also like to thank you, Sir, for your statement and to highlight the good cooperation we have had with the African Union on the topics that I will mention later.  Conflict-related sexual violence is, as I think the Swedish Minister said earlier today, a security challenge. It is also a horrible, despicable example of a violation of basic human rights. Therefore, I am very grateful again that you, Mr. President, to have put it on the agenda.  I would like to commend Special Representative of the Secretary-General Pramila Patten for her tireless work. I am very happy, having listened to all the remarks around the table for at least part of the discussion, that the Secretary-General's report (S\/2018\/250) and her presentation today, with just a few exceptions, have been commended by everybody. Germany supports her work and will continue to do so.  I would like to highlight the depressing findings about sexual violence as \"a tactic of war\" and about the change of demographics and so forth that were referred to in the report of the Secretary-General and in the remarks she made earlier today. Using sexual violence as an instrument to force people into submission is as grave as using gas for the same purpose. Let me focus on four points.  First, we must support the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict and her team of experts in carrying out her mandate. Germany is committed to providing support. We have worked very closely, in particular on the issue of Iraq. I also appreciate the fact that the Iraqi Ambassador highlighted the good cooperation between Office of the Special Representative and Iraq. One of the most outrageous examples of sexual violence in recent decades, which has been discussed today, is the widespread use of sexual violence as a strategy to terrorize the Rohingya community. We urge the authorities of Myanmar to work very closely with the Special Representative to enter into structured dialogue with the United Nations to assist survivors and ensure accountability. When the Security Council travels to Myanmar, I urge it to put this item on the agenda and take up the proposal put forward by Ms. Sultana for the Council to meet with survivors of sexual violence. I believe that the Council would send a clear and important message if it met with people who suffered such crimes.  I would like to highlight other activities of the Special Representative, such as work being conducted in the Sudan. There is a culture of silence surrounding sexual violence in Darfur, which is of deep concern. We encourage the Sudanese Government to work closely with the Council to grant access to the survivors.  Secondly, I would like to address the issue of accountability. As the observer of the African Union just stated, sexual violence, zero-tolerance. It is very important to ensure accountability for all grave violations of human rights - that is key. We owe it to the victims. It is also very important to foster reconciliation and deterrence. I would like to reiterate what was highlighted earlier with regard to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where action was taken. Those who committed such crimes must be punished. If they have not yet been punished, for the rest of their lives they must look over their shoulder and fear being caught until they are apprehended. That covers current and past crimes. A representative today also mentioned the sexual violence that occurred in Europe during the wars in the former Yugoslavia. There was no accountability in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia or, in particular, Kosovo, for the tens of thousands of victims.  The Security Council should include sexual violence as a designation criterion for sanctions regimes much more regularly. The Council should also refer cases of sexual violence to the International Criminal Court. In instances where prosecution is not yet possible, the collection and preservation of evidence of mass atrocities must be ensured. Germany supports the crucial work of the Commission for International Justice and Accountability in northern Iraq and Syria. Germany also supports the new International, Independent and Impartial Mechanism, which, inter alia, should focus on crimes of sexual violence.  Thirdly, we must adopt a survivor-centred approach. My French colleague referred to it as holistic support for survivors. It is important to provide them with medical and psychological care. Economic opportunities and legal protection should also be offered to them. Germany has received a large number of women and children who have suffered traumatic experiences in conflicts in Iraq and Syria. We fund projects in Iraq to enable comprehensive assistance to be provided. I have already mentioned our good cooperation with the Special Representative and the Iraqi Government.  The survivor-centred approach links accountability with psychosocial and livelihood support. Many have mentioned that stigmatization must be fought. It is very important that we educate girls and enhance gender- baIance efforts. With regard to stigma, I would like to highlight what our colleagues from Equatorial Guinea and Poland stated earlier today. They said that we must focus on the children conceived through rape, who continue to need our support because of stigmatization. Fourthly, with regard to the sharing of experiences and best practices, the issue of empowering survivors was on the agenda of the annual meeting of the Women, Peace and Security Focal Points Network, which Germany, together with Spain and Namibia, hosted last week in Berlin. Special Representative Patten and others present today attended that meeting. It served as a platform for sharing experiences and best practices. My Spanish colleague already mentioned it and highlighted the fact that methods of improving accountability for crimes of sexual violence was one of the subjects discussed. Namibia, Spain and Germany will provide a briefing of the Focal Points Network meeting at the end of the month here in New York. We will extend invitations to those who are not yet members of the Network to join us. We also support the sharing of regional experiences through the African Women Leaders Network. The observer of the African Union already highlighted the important cooperation already taking place in Africa, which is compelling and encouraging. My colleague from Kazakhstan mentioned that earlier today.  Once again, I thank you, Sir, for including today's subject on the agenda. Germany will remain committed to it. We are also committed to eliminating and preventing conflict-related violence. The issue of women and peace and security will remain a top priority for us.  ",
    " I would like to start by thanking the Deputy Secretary-General, Ms. Amina Mohammed, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Ms. Pramila Patten, and Ms. Razia Sultana for their pertinent briefings. I also wish to express our sincere gratitude to Peru for organizing this important debate.  The Kingdom of the Netherlands fully aligns itself with the statement to be delivered by the observer of the European Union, as well as that to be delivered on behalf of the Group of Friends of Women, Peace and Security.  The Secretary-General's report (S\/2018\/250) and today's testimonies from the briefers describe in no uncertain terms the gruesome and widespread prevalence of sexual violence in both conflict-affected and post-conflict settings. The mere fact that the report covers one tenth of the United Nations membership is disturbing in itself. Allow me to focus on three important aspects: first, the plight of the Rohingya in Myanmar; secondly, the fight against sexual exploitation and abuse; and, thirdly, the course of action to stop impunity.  The Kingdom of the Netherlands adds its voice to that of today's civil society briefer, Ms. Sultana, in condemning in the strongest terms the cruelty that Rohingya women and girls have faced both before and after fleeing their homes in Rakhine state. We cannot remain silent about the injustice done, and the trauma inflicted on, those women and girls and their wider communities. It is upsetting that now, after Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a State actor has once again been listed as being credibly suspected or responsible for sexual violence in a situation of armed conflict. That demands a concerted response from the international community to bring justice and rehabilitation to the victims of that violence.  There is a mosaic on the third floor of this building that reads \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\", which brings me to my second point. While the report primarily looks at sexual violence inflicted by armed groups and State actors, we cannot ignore cases of sexual exploitation and abuse or sexual harassment committed by those working for, or associated, with the United Nations. The Kingdom of the Netherlands reaffirms its total commitment to the United Nations zero-tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and on sexual harassment - a matter that is rightfully gaining the attention and visibility it deserves. Masculine-dominated cultures often create obstacles to upholding zero-tolerance policies. However, like the Secretary-General, we are determined to remove those obstacles and work towards true gender equality. Moreover, by including women and the gender perspective in prevention, peacekeeping and conflict resolution, we can diminish sexual violence in conflict, as well as sexual exploitation and abuse.  My third point is on the course of action to stop impunity. I would like to echo the words of Special Representative Patten: sexual violence is avoidable. The very first recommendation that the Secretary- General makes to the Security Council in his report is to include sexual violence as a part of the designation criteria for sanctions. Sanctions are a tool that could be more effectively used to deter sexual violence and to curb and constrain the individuals involved. They have the potential to protect the safety and lives of millions of women and girls, as well as boys and men, living in conflict areas. The recent inclusion of that criterion in the sanctions regime for the Central African Republic is a welcome development that needs to be taken up more consistently. We call on the Council to systematically and explicitly incorporate and apply sexual violence as a designation criterion in sanctions regimes, particularly in those regimes targeting the actors listed in the report. For those conflict-affected countries for which no specific United Nations sanctions regime exists, we urge the Council to consider the adoption of targeted sanctions regimes that would allow for the inclusions of a specific designation criterion on sexual violence.  Ultimately, sanctions cannot be an alternative to prosecution for crimes that are punishable under international law. It is first and foremost up to Member States to ensure the prosecution of perpetrators and to facilitate reparations under international humanitarian law. Furthermore, it is up to Member States to guarantee survivor's access to all legal, psychosocial and medical services, including safe abortion, emergency contraception and HIV treatment.  Strengthening the capacity of national institutions is critical to ensuring accountability for past crimes and prevention and deterrence for the future. In that context, we recognize the work of the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict in building national capacities to enhance accountability for conflict-related sexual violence. However, if national governments prove to be unable or unwilling, the Council should revert to other means and channels, such as the International Criminal Court, to make sure that both State and non-State parties comply with their obligations under international law.  Let me end by reiterating our strong support for the work of Special Representative Patten and the vision she has articulated since assuming office last year.  ",
    " I would like to thank the German presidency for convening today's open debate on a topic of the utmost importance.  Estonia aligns itself with the statement to be delivered by the observer of the European Union. In addition, I would like to make the following few remarks.  Peacekeeping operations and uniformed personnel are the most visible representatives of the United Nations, directly working with communities every day. For that reason, it is imperative to increase the number of female peacekeepers and promote their full, effective and meaningful participation in United Nations peace operations. Estonia therefore strongly supports the recently adopted uniformed gender-parity strategy for the period 2018-2028 and related efforts of the Action for Peacekeeping initiative.  Since the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, and its follow- up resolutions, remarkable achievements have been made at the normative level. Women and peace and security issues are now interlinked with the United Nations peacekeeping agenda. However, challenges lie at the level of implementation, and we must continue promoting the role of women in peace and security at the national, regional and international levels.  On the national level, Estonia has significantly increased its level of ambition regarding female conscripts in the military service, having tripled the number of women that can be called to serve. That has had a direct and positive impact on Estonia's ability as a troop-contributing country to accelerate gender parity among United Nations peacekeeping troops by encouraging female military and police personnel  to apply. In addition to striving to increase the number of female peacekeepers, we consider it paramount to sensitize all peacekeepers on gender aspects in peace operations. Thorough predeployment training on human rights and gender-related issues, including on the prevention of, and response to, conflict-related sexual violence and the eradication of sexual exploitation and abuse, is a must. Therefore, gender advisers should be an integral part of all United Nations missions, and their activities must be further reinforced in settings where conflict-related sexual violence is widespread.  Last, but not least, we would like to thank Canada for launching the Elsie Initiative for Women in Peace Operations to identify, address and remove the existing barriers to women's meaningful participation in United Nations peace operations in different troop-contributing countries and military and police organizations. That kind of practical evidence-based approach could be the way to help us to achieve the ambitious objectives that we have set on women's participation and impact on United Nations peacekeeping.  I thank you, Mr. President, for including women and peace and security as one of the main topics of your presidency. We all recognize the importance of involving women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts, peace negotiations, peacebuilding and in post-conflict reconstruction, and should act accordingly. For its part, Estonia would like to continue focusing on the issue of women and peace and security as a non-permanent member of the Security Council during 2020-2021 period.  ",
    " On behalf of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), I would like to start by thanking the delegation of Germany for the excellent work carried out during its presidency of the Council during this month of April,  and by wishing you, Mr. President, every success in the work that remains to be done.  I would also like to thank the Secretary-General and his Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, as well as all the other speakers who have preceded me, for their constructive contributions to this open debate.  The choice of today's topic reflects your commitment, Sir, to the protection and advancement of women and girls against sexual violence in conflict situations, within the United Nations humanitarian framework. It is a pledge of your firm commitment to address that worrying question with renewed vigour in order to finally move from words to deeds.  The Economic Community of Central African States congratulates you, Mr. President, on this undertaking and takes the opportunity to commend the concrete initiatives taken by its member States, as well as their sustained political will, as evidenced by the implementation of laws, policies and mechanisms to address abuses of women in conflict-affected areas. ECCAS continues to assure its member States of its full collaboration in the process of aligning national legislation with regional and international instruments.  Despite the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000) and subsequent resolutions, which have been crucial in raising awareness regarding violence against women and girls during times of conflict and in humanitarian environments in which they are regularly raped and abused with full impunity, nonetheless women and girls continue to be subjected to all kinds of sexual abuse in the midst of conflict, where the use of that inhumane and degrading practice has become the norm and rape is a weapon of war.  It is urgent that we put an end to that trend in the name of the young girls, women and children who are seeing the world crumble around them without any hope of resuming a normal life or having their attackers brought to justice. To that end, a change in our practices and actions in peacekeeping and peacebuilding missions, as well as in the protection of civilians, is essential if we are to eradicate the scourge.  It is in that context that ECCAS is striving to consolidate early warning mechanisms to strengthen its capacities in preventing and managing armed conflict by advocating for the participation of women in peace and security processes. It is also for the sake of contributing to that effort that seven of its 11 member States have adopted national action plans on innovative resolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security. A regional action plan for the resolution's implementation has also been approved and adopted by member States.  It should also be emphasized that the economic and social empowerment of women is at the heart of all the actions undertaken in the context of national plans, because it is indeed a cross-cutting issue in all sectors. It is therefore imperative, including in the areas of peace, security and inclusive governance, that a favourable climate be established to ensure that women participate actively in mediation, peacekeeping and peacebuilding, as well as in post-conflict building efforts, while benefiting from laws that protect them in armed conflict.  Allow me to recall an example that was highlighted so eloquently by the representative of Rwanda, namely, the 250,000 rape victims of Rwanda - one of our member States - during the genocide perpetrated against the Tutsi in 1994, who saw their hopes and dreams forever shattered, especially since the majority of them contracted HIV\/AIDS. I am also compelled to mention the daily abuses suffered by women in the areas where armed groups thrive in our subregion. Such heinous and humiliating crimes, such as rape, sexual abuse and violence against women in times of conflict, rob victims of all dignity and lead to discrimination against them and stigmatization, while leaving them with moral, physical and psychological wounds.  In order to address the root causes of all forms of violence against women and girls, the following essential steps have been proposed in some ofour member States' national plans for the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000), which should be encouraged and supported: first, allocating resources to prevent sexual abuse and mitigate its consequences, while raising awareness of violence against women in conflict settings; secondly, strengthening social justice mechanisms and creating institutional and legal frameworks to facilitate access to justice, while developing policies to fight impunity; thirdly, monitoring and evaluating progress; fourthly, prosecuting the perpetrators of such crimes and providing support and reparations to survivors of sexual violence; and lastly, ensuring that women are represented in the contingents deployed in peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations, as well as  in post-conflict building, and sharing good practices with local authorities.  To conclude, the ultimate goal of today's debate can be attained by adhering to the different preconditions that we have just cited. If we establish all the necessary circumstances, we will be able to arrive at practical solutions for transforming the negative experiences of victims of rape and sexual violence into positive developments so as to restore human dignity and eliminate once and for all violence against women and the structural obstacles to their economic, social and political empowerment and gender equality.  ECCAS will continue its reach out to member States to encourage them to accelerate the implementation of their national plans on resolution 1325 (2000), as well as the legal decisions and instruments adopted to enable women to participate in all spheres of life. To that end, ECCAS welcomes the collaboration with its strategic partners, particularly the United Nations, the African Union and the other regional economic communities, as well as civil society and the private sector, in exchanging experiences and good practices.  Finally, we welcome the support of those partners in pooling human and material resources at the regional, national and continental levels with a view to charting the way forward and identifying the collective actions to be taken to win the fight against sexual violence.

    " At the outset, I would like to express our appreciation to the South African presidency for convening the annual Security Council open debate focusing on the implementation of the women and peace and security agenda. I would also like to thank the presidency of the United Kingdom for the resumption of the open debate today. Our appreciation also goes to the Secretary-General for his latest annual report (S\/2019\/800), which provides a valuable assessment on the implementation of the relevant resolutions, as well as pertinent recommendations to further advance the women and peace and security agenda.  As we prepare to mark the twentieth anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000), which laid the foundation for the women and peace and security agenda, we need to reflect on our achievements and address the remaining gaps and challenges in realizing our overall objective in a unified manner. In that understanding, Turkey co-sponsored resolution 2493 (2019) adopted on 29 October.  Turkey has placed gender equality at the heart of its foreign policy and therefore considers the increased use of the women and peace and security agenda across all its four pillars as a critical tool for conflict prevention and resolution, as well as for peacebuilding and sustaining peace. Through resolution 1325 (2000) and subsequent related Security Council resolutions, a solid normative framework has been established to that end. We also welcomed the adoption of resolution 2467 (2019), on sexual violence in conflict, in April and see it as a further concrete enhancement of the framework.  We are pleased to see that these resolutions have encouraged the United Nations system and Member States to step up their efforts and develop programmes to increase women's participation as leaders in the military and law enforcement and as peacebuilders in treaty and peace agreement negotiations. There has also been deeper awareness of and more serious attention afforded to the asymmetric impact of conflict on women and their vulnerability.  In that context, Turkey considers the work of the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict and the Informal Expert Group on Women and Peace and Security, as well as the development of the Secretary-General's uniformed gender parity strategy 2018-2028, as important steps towards strengthening the role of women in maintaining peace and security.  Turkey remains committed to contributing to the advancement of the women and peace and security agenda by taking into account the specific protection needs of women as a result of armed conflicts. We continue to provide assistance and psychosocial support for women and girls affected by armed conflict in our region. As such, Turkey deploys multifaceted services to offer dignified living conditions to more than 3.5 million Syrians who have taken refuge in Turkey, fleeing the conflict in Syria. Of those people, 1.6 million are women.  Women's health centres established by the Turkish Ministry of Family, in cooperation with the Ministry of Health and the United Nations Population Fund, offer health training, comprehensive support and empowerment programmes for those women and girls. Since 2014, the programme has delivered multidimensional support to almost 400,000 refugees in and outside temporary refugee centres. For the years 2020 and 2021, we will further strengthen the service capacity and expand the coverage of that project.  While we work hard to mitigate the countless negative effects of displacement on women affected by armed conflict, we regret that earlier in this open debate, this platform was abused to disseminate falsehoods about my country's limited cross-border counter-terrorism operation. Turkey's views on that issue were amply presented to the Security Council on 24 October (see S\/PV.8645). We flatly reject and condemn any misrepresentation of Turkey's counter- terrorism efforts. It is clear that we do not have any moral lessons to learn from those who have refrained from doing their part in shouldering responsibilities related to the refugee crisis.  Despite measurable progress, much work remains to be done to fully translate the women and peace and security agenda into action. That requires additional concerted efforts by not only Member States, but also United Nations entities, as well as regional organizations and civil society. It is imperative to directly address the root causes of conflicts, including through the promotion of gender equality and the greater and meaningful participation of women in all forms of mediation, conflict prevention, United Nations peace operations, post-conflict recovery and peacebuilding processes.  Needless to say, further efforts are required to see more women assume positions of leadership at the negotiating table, thereby enhancing their engagement in political and economic decision-making. As we look forward to the twentieth anniversary of resolution 2325 (2000), Turkey stands ready to play its role.  ",
    " I thank the delegations of the United Kingdom and South Africa for resuming this important open debate on women, peace and security. Our meeting today is being held as we approach a number of anniversaries, including the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, adopted at the fourth World Conference on Women, and the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), which calls for the central participation of women in conflict resolution and prevention.  We welcome the report of the Secretary-General (S\/2019\/800) on women and peace and security. We also welcome its important recommendations, including concerning the adoption of national action plans on women and peace and security, coupled with the necessary resources, the monitoring of their implementation, their localization and the appointment of women as mediators and negotiators in all formal peace processes.  The Kingdom of Bahrain is committed to strengthening cooperation with the United Nations and its agencies in supporting women and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. In 2017, we inaugurated the UN-Women office in the Kingdom as part of our cooperation between UN-Women and the Supreme Council for Women. The Kingdom of Bahrain has sought to promote the leadership role and participation of women in national structures and legislation, pursuant to one of the priorities of the national action plan adopted in 2005. That is part of the reform approach launched by His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain.  We have seen many achievements by Bahraini women, including the election of Ms. Fawzia Zainal as the First Speaker of Parliament. In 2017, Her Royal Highness the King's wife launched the Princess Sabeeka bint Ibrahim Al Khalifa International Award for Women Empowerment. Her Royal Highness chairs the Supreme Council for Women in Bahrain. This is the first award of its kind in the world. It recognizes institutional and individual efforts to promote women's advancement and contribution to development. In 2014, the Kingdom of Bahrain established a gender parity committee to ensure that women are given equal opportunities in the labour market.  In line with our belief in the importance of education for empowering women and girls, especially those affected by conflict, the Kingdom of Bahrain has established a number of schools in Syrian refugee camps in Jordan, as well as in Gaza. The Kingdom of Bahrain is committed to combating all practices that prevent the empowerment of women, including human trafficking. For the second year in a row, the Kingdom of Bahrain has been ranked in the top category, according to the United States Department of State report on trafficking in persons, as one of the leading countries in combating this illegal practice.  In conclusion, we stress the importance ofall efforts aimed at promoting the empowerment of women and their advancement in all areas as an effective partner for maintaining international peace and security as well as achieving prosperity.  ",
    " Let me point out that I have two statements to deliver today. The first will be made on behalf of a group of countries and the second in my national capacity. I am pleased to speak on behalf of 55 Member States, representing all five regional groups of the United Nations.  On the tenth anniversary of the mandate of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, we applaud the critical work carried out by Ms. Patten and pledge our full support to her office.  We remain outraged by the persistent and widespread occurrence of sexual violence in armed conflict, committed by State and non-State actors. Sexual violence in conflict is not inevitable and is never acceptable. We underline that a climate of impunity discourages reporting, undermines assistance and abets further violations. Therefore, we are gravely concerned that, despite the systematic use of sexual violence by groups such as Da'esh and Boko Haram, no individuals from such groups have been convicted for sexual violence crimes.  Responsibility for the fight against impunity lies with us, the Member States. Addressing and preventing sexual violence is a core commitment of the women and peace and security agenda. We must ensure that robust legal and institutional arrangements are in place to address sexual violence in armed conflict and that steps are taken to investigate and prosecute perpetrators.  As information is an essential prerequisite for accountability, we support survivor-centred efforts to more systematically document and report sexual violence in armed conflict and post-conflict situations. In that regard, we urge the Secretary-General to ensure that gender and sexual violence expertise is included in international procedures, such as investigative mechanisms, commissions of inquiry, United Nations fact-finding missions and Security Council sanctions committees.  We repeat our call on the Security Council to systematically and explicitly incorporate and apply sexual violence as a designation criterion in United Nations sanction regimes, where such crimes are persistently perpetrated. We reaffirm that amnesty should not be granted to perpetrators of sexual violence and that sexual violence should be explicitly prohibited by the terms of ceasefires and peace agreements.  In all our efforts to ensure accountability, we must not lose sight of the needs and rights of survivors of sexual violence in conflict. As a starting point, the United Nations and its Member States should place a greater emphasis on listening to the diverse voices of survivors, as well as collaborating with the civil society organizations working to address sexual violence in armed conflict. That approach helps to empower survivors, identify barriers to assistance and justice, avoid further harm and improve our collective response and accountability.  Sexual violence against men and boys is also an expression of unequal gender norms. Responses must take into account the diverse and intersecting experience, identities and needs of all victims and survivors.  Greater efforts are also needed at all levels to ensure that survivors of sexual violence and children born of rape have access to non-discriminatory and comprehensive health services, including sexual and reproductive health, psychosocial, legal and livelihood support and other multisectoral services, taking into account the specific needs of persons with disabilities and in line with resolution 2106 (2013).  As part of our efforts to secure both accountability and victim support, we want to emphasize the importance of providing reparations to survivors of sexual violence in armed conflict.  Finally, sexual violence in conflict is part of a continuum of violence, including in peacetime, that is fuelled by gender inequality. We believe that systemic gender-based discrimination, such as women's exclusion from political life and economic marginalization, as well as discriminatory legal systems and customs, is conducive to sexual violence in conflict. Any serious effort to prevent and address sexual violence in conflict must move beyond the immediate symptoms and  confront structural inequality itself. Such an approach should include the protection of women human rights defenders, who are themselves the target of attack.  (spoke in French)  I would now like to make a few additional remarks in my capacity as the representative of Canada.  Today's debate is of key importance to my country. Canada's feminist foreign policy puts gender considerations at the core of its global engagement, and the reason is simple. It is because the evidence is irrefutable. Supporting gender equality is the best way to build a more peaceful, inclusive and prosperous world. Sadly, today the Council's briefers confirmed what we already knew. Sexual and gender-based violence is widespread. Women, girls, LGBTI individuals and other members of marginalized groups are targets. That will change only through concerted efforts. My country is not immune to that scourge. In Canada, the double discrimination that indigenous women and girls endure has increased our levels of sexual and gender-based Violence. Within the framework of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, which is taking place this week, I want to affirm my Government's strong commitment to addressing the issue.  Just as we seek to prevent sexual and gender-based violence at home, we also support efforts around the world. In Myanmar, we are working with UNICEF and the United Nations Population Fund to remove systemic barriers to sexual and reproductive health and rights. In the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo, we are supporting the work of the United Nations Development Programme in providing survivors of Violence with legal, medical and psychosocial support. For the next two years, Canada will lead the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-based Violence in Emergencies. We are also working to strengthen accountability at the global level. The laws are indeed changing, even if too slowly. In the meantime, the inability of existing national legal frameworks to deal with such crimes in no way diminishes the seriousness of those crimes. In such cases, we therefore believe firmly that we have a collective legal and moral responsibility to act.  (spoke in English)  A lack of political will, including in the Council,  should also not enable impunity. The shortcomings of the systems in place should be recognized and addressed and alternative approaches pursued. For example, Canada is supporting the deployment of experts through UN- Women to secure accountability for sexual and gender- based crimes in Myanmar, Syria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, Burundi, Yemen and Mali. Such deployments make a difference. The sexual and gender-based violence experts deployed with Canadian support to the independent international fact-finding mission on Myanmar directly contributed to a finding that sexual and gender-based violence in Myanmar's Kachin, Shan and Rakhine states amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity. While this work is critical, we know it is not easy. Canada's support for the collection of evidence of crimes by Da'esh in Iraq and Syria has encountered a number of challenges. Survivors and witnesses express legitimate and growing frustrations about the delays in obtaining justice, as well as a sense of psychological fatigue from repeatedly having to share their experiences with media outlets and non-governmental organizations.  International support for investigative bodies documenting sexual violence is key, but we must acknowledge our own responsibilities if we are to prevent the revictimization of survivors. We must all continue to ensure that the voices of victims and their families are fully reflected in our efforts. All victims of sexual and gender-based violence expect action. They expect justice and accountability, and better efforts on prevention. They are right. I would expect the same, and I suspect Council members would too. Resolution 2467 (2019), adopted today, has many important elements, and we commend Germany for its tireless efforts. However, we are disappointed that it is silent on at least two counts. We urge the Council to explicitly recognize that LGBTI individuals are targets of sexual violence in conflict owing specifically to their sexual orientation or gender identity. That persecution is nothing new. Homosexuals, branded with pink triangles by the Nazis and pushed off buildings by Da'esh, have always been targeted. Situations of armed conflict magnify underlying discrimination against LGBTI individuals, which can be manifested through sexual violence. While such persecution is unfortunately long-standing, what is new is the growing expectation of concrete action. As my colleague from Uruguayjust pointed out, greater efforts are needed to monitor and report on such violence and ensure that Member States strengthen their national legislation to protect LGBTI victims.  Canada also very much regrets that consensus could not be reached on a reference in the resolution to sexual and reproductive health rights. The Security Council should not be backtracking on conclusions that it has itself reached in recent years. One step forward cannot involve two steps back. To be clear, sexual and reproductive health rights are essential to women's autonomy and human rights. That is as true now as it was when the Council considered the issue previously. We cannot promote gender equality, address sexual violence in conflict or implement a survivor-centred approach without ensuring sexual and reproductive health rights.  Should Canada be elected to serve on the Council as a non-permanent member for the period from 2021 to 2022, we will be deeply committed to continuing to advance this agenda.  ",
    " It is an honour to have you, the German Federal Minister of Defence, among us today, Madam President, presiding over the Security Council during the joint presidencies of the Council. France and Germany have made the women and peace and security agenda a top priority, as demonstrated by our open debate with you as President today. We are particularly grateful to you for that. I would also like to thank the Secretary-General, Major General Kristin Lund and Ms. Lorna Merekaje for their very insightful briefings and their commitment to the women and peace and security agenda, which are a source of inspiration for us. I would like to reiterate our full support to the Secretary-General and his team for the ambitious and effective strategy that he has put in place to achieve parity within the United Nations.  I also associate myself with the statements to be delivered by the observer of the European Union and the representative of Canada on behalf of the Group of Friends ofWomen and Peace and Security. The Security Council should step up its efforts to still further integrate the women and peace and security agenda into peacekeeping operations. Significant progress has been made but we must do more to truly place that agenda at the centre of peacekeeping operations.  In mandates, that integration covers several realities: from prevention and protection against sexual violence in times of conflict to women's participation in political processes. We must continue to promote that comprehensive approach in particular by ensuring the deployment of gender and women protection advisers. We all know that that is an ongoing task both in the Council and the Fifth Committee. During a ministerial meeting on the margins of the General Assembly, the Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs, Mr. Jean- Yves Le Drian, recalled that peacekeepers \"engage in situations in which no nation is ready to engage alone\". We must therefore ensure that the necessary training and logistical support are provided not only to those men but also increasingly to the women who are committed to peace.  Secondly, the increasing participation of women in peacekeeping operations is essential to the success of our agenda and to peacekeeping operations themselves. As is clearly documented, the increased participation of women directly helps to strengthen the effectiveness of operations. It is true that in all fields, across the board, the added value is particularly strong in areas such as access to local communities and victims' access to care and justice, to take just two examples among many others. More generally, no position should be reserved only for men.  Progress has been made but it is still insufficient. That must be said. There are still 27 units without women, compared to 49 last year. Women represent 5 per cent of the troops and 8 per cent of the police contingents, which is still far from the goals set by the Council. It is primarily the troop-contributing countries that should fully assume that responsibility. The feminization rate of French troops in peacekeeping operations was 5.5 per cent in 2018, which is already a higher rate than the United Nations target of 5.25 per cent for 2019. In February, the rate was 8.4 per cent. That is significant progress but, of course, much remains to be done. We are the first to say it, including with regard to us. We must in particular increase the number of women appointed to staff officer positions.  For States to assume that responsibility, as you, Madam President, said, they must lead a real paradigm shift in their national armies. That is what France is firmly doing, with conditions and in a voluntary way. The French army now has one of the highest levels of women's participation in the world, with a rate of 20 per cent overall and 15.5 per cent for military personnel. France wants to go further. On 7 March, the eve of International Women's Rights Day, the Minister of the Armed Forces, your colleague Florence Parly, announced a gender-equity plan to support France's operational performance, which has three main objectives: to recruit women, to retain them throughout their careers and to promote gender diversity in the armed forces. Those goals will be achieved through very concrete measures, such as women's participation in military leadership or a new approach to access to ranks and responsibilities.  As our Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs, Mr. Le Drian, recalled, the involvement of women in our national army and peace operations will be integrated into our third national plan to implement resolution 1325 (2000), which is currently being drafted, and specific cooperation actions will be undertaken in that direction. France also supports the participation of women in police and military training schools in several African countries, including courses on violence against women and girls and on the role of women in mediation.  Member States can count on France to continue to actively promote women's participation in peacekeeping operations and in the overall women and peace and security agenda. The President of the Republic, Mr. Emmanuel Macron, expressed the wish that equality between women and men, a major national cause of the five-year period, would also become a major international cause. That was a priority goal of our presidency of the Security Council in March. It is also a priority of our current presidency of the Group of Seven. The anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000) in 2020 and the Beijing + 25 forum, which will take place in France the same year, provide a unique opportunity to give a fresh impetus to that agenda, despite the odds, and to ultimately enable its full implementation.  To echo the words of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, we should all be feminists, including those on the Security Council. The agenda that we are discussing today is at the heart of the revolution currently under way within the United Nations to promote the role of women and parity on every front. That revolution is of course essential in itself, but also for the success of multilateralism, to which we are committed now more than ever. That is to say how much France intends to continue to be a driver of this revolution, which nothing and no one can stop.  ",
    " On behalf of my delegation, let me first express our heartfelt gratitude to all those delegations that have extended their condolences and support to the Government and people of Sri Lanka at this difficult time, as we face an unprecedented challenge.  We congratulate Germany, as President of the Council for the month of April, on having organized this debate, especially as we approach the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000). We also thank the Secretary-General for his report (S\/2019\/280) and the briefers for their valuable comments.  As a troop-contributing country, Sri Lanka has taken many steps with regard to sexual exploitation and abuse in United Nations operations, including by joining the Secretary-General's Circle of Leadership, signing the Secretary-General's voluntary compact on preventing and addressing sexual exploitation and abuse and contributing to the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Victims of Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children.  The long, drawn-out conflict that Sri Lanka experienced has left deep-seated scars on our society. Women were major Victims. Orphans, war widows, single mothers and women-headed households were the legacy of that conflict. Heightened vulnerabilities, especially during conflict, render women and girls far more susceptible to violence, and my delegation strongly condemns violence, intimidation, harassment and abuse directed towards women in all its forms and manifestations, whenever they occur.  As Sri Lanka engages in rebuilding our society and healing our communities through reconciliation and justice mechanisms, we are committed to addressing the immediate concerns of women and girls by empowering them, providing them a safe space in which to speak out and making them equal participants in all areas of peacebuilding and peacekeeping. Sri Lanka's Administration has approved a set of recommendations presented by the Prime Minister on preventing sexual and gender-based violence. Those recommendations include the formulation and enforcement of laws to combat violence against women and girls and the introduction of social protection measures.  With regard to allegations of sexual violence during the period of the conflict, the Government has established mechanisms to ensure the right to justice. In 2016, Sri Lanka endorsed the Declaration of Commitment to End Sexual Violence in Conflict. Noting the concerns raised regarding alleged sexual violence, a series of directives have been issued by the President of Sri Lanka with regard to alleged human rights violations. Action has also been taken to prosecute the perpetrators of reported incidences of rape by individual members of the security forces.  There are several action plans that focus on sexual and gender-based violence in the country. In line with the underlying principle of zero tolerance for sexual and gender-based violence in Sri Lanka, the policy framework and national plan of action to address sexual and gender-based violence, launched in November 2016, provide a holistic policy guideline to address the issue of violence against women.  Awareness-raising programmes have also been conducted by the Government, as well as civil society organizations, on zero tolerance for gender- based violence, legal protections and institutional mechanisms for women at the grass-roots level. The Ministry of Women and Child Affairs has its own units in former conflict areas. Women development officers and counsellors have taken a keen interest in providing victim-centred rehabilitation for victims of violence. Psychosocial counselling as a healing process is available and given to women victims of violence by the Office of National Unity and Reconciliation.  One recent phenomenon that has emerged regarding sexual and gender-based violence is the request made by civil society organizations to take measures to address the biases that operate against victim survivors as a result of the stigma associated with the incident. They have also requested that the Government develop guidelines to encourage stakeholders to take the initiative to act with responsibility in order to enable victim survivors and their families to participate in society as equals.  ",
    " I thank the South African presidency of the Security Council for convening today's important and timely open debate on women and peace and security. I express my warm appreciation to all the briefers as well as civil society representatives for their determined efforts aimed at championing the women and peace and security agenda. We also welcome the unanimous adoption of resolution 2493 (2019) today, which we fully endorse.  Despite commendable strides, we witness the lack of opportunities for women to assume leadership roles in times of conflict and peace alike. As the Secretary- General underscored in his recent report (S\/2019\/800), ensuring the meaningful participation of women in all phases of United Nations-backed peace processes remains a challenge. While, on the one hand, this is due to violent conflicts becoming more complex and fractured with the proliferation of non-State actors, there is, on the other hand, an existing gap between intentions and the implementation of the women and peace and security agenda in many key areas.  Supporting the six proposals in the Secretary- General's recent report, we make the following five additional recommendations.  First, greater focus should be given by troop- and police-contributing countries to providing special gender-sensitive training and to including more women in their national deployments to field missions. This approach must be accompanied by the appointment of gender specialists in every peacekeeping operation unit, including human rights, rule of law, security sector reform and humanitarian units.  Secondly, Member States should fully implement the Secretary-General's policy of zero tolerance for infractions by United Nations personnel. Thirdly, efforts should be redoubled to support women in grass-roots organizations working for a culture of peace, community-based reconciliation and an end to all forms of impunity. Women must be given leadership training to raise political awareness and conduct peace education, as well as to engage in social reconstruction and integration activities.  Fourthly, women should be involved in the management and security of camps for refugees and internally displaced persons, especially women and girls, and assist in the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process.  Fifthly, women should be increasingly engaged in the women and peace and security agenda for conflict prevention and resolution and in transformative change across the three pillars ofthe United Nations. Likewise, Member States should decisively mobilize the Council's Informal Expert Group on Women, Peace and Security; the Women's Peace and Humanitarian Fund; the Women, Peace and Security Focal Points Network; and the Peacebuilding Commission's gender strategy.  Kazakhstan strongly believes that the education of women and girls, especially in rural areas, should be provided as a key to true progress on women's empowerment to bring about social transformation.  Last year, together with the European Union and the United Nations Development Programme, Kazakhstan launched an education programme to train Afghan women in Kazakh universities. This month, the first group of 30 women began an eight-month English- language course leading to admission to Bachelor's, Master's and technical programmes in four very eminent Almaty-based institutions. It is our principled position that Afghanistan should not be Viewed as a source of challenges but as one of opportunities based on its economic integration into Central Asia and through connectivity and investments in regional infrastructure, trade and transit-transportation projects. As part of the country's rich human capital, women must be active in these processes, and we are privileged to be able to help. We encourage and appeal to donor countries to allocate more scholarships for women and girls from conflict-affected countries.  Kazakhstan is working to achieve the highest world standards in gender policy and strengthen the role of women in its sociopolitical and economic life by formulating new strong pro-women policies in its 2050 Strategy. The aim is to achieve gender parity in decision-making at all levels.  In response to the Secretary-General's call to achieve greater gender balance in peacekeeping operations, Kazakhstan has since 2018 begun deploying women peacekeepers to the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara and United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. We plan to increase this number further.  In conclusion, Kazakhstan pledges its unfailing support to ensure that women can be powerful catalysts and agents of transformation on all fronts.  "
